The 'whoami.exe' is also there, which is a normal command to check user identity.

But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThere's a 'File Delete logged' event for a temporary PowerShell script. Deleting a script might be normal if it's part of a cleanup, but if it's to remove evidence, that's suspicious. However, the script name seems generic.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be related to logging or monitoring tools, like Winlogbeat. The 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory could be part of a legitimate setup, but sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious purposes.\n\nNow, considering all together: multiple PowerShell and cmd processes, registry changes, image loads of system files, and file deletions. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or known malicious payloads. The presence of legitimate processes and system files makes it hard to classify as definitely malicious.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe doing registry value sets. Those are common system processes, so maybe normal. Then there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, that's a legitimate DLL, but maybe if it's being loaded in an unusual context? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe entries with ProcessAccess events. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a normal tool. The command lines for cmd.exe and WMIC.exe stand out. For example, the cmd.exe command uses wmic to delete a process named notepad.exe. That's suspicious because deleting processes can be part of a malware's behavior to remove traces. Also, another cmd.exe command copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. Sethc is the Sticky Keys utility, and replacing it with a backup could be a sign of a malicious replacement, like a backdoor.\n\nThen there's the schtasks.exe entry, which is used to manage scheduled tasks. The command line shows deleting a task named win32times. Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack. Also, multiple ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate processes, which is often seen in attacks.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious activities involve modifying system processes (like replacing sethc.exe), using WMIC and cmd to delete processes, and manipulating scheduled tasks. These actions are often associated with malicious activities, such as installing backdoors or evading detection. The presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd events with specific commands points towards potential compromise.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event. It's a process creation for powershell.exe with a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content. The command creates a batch file and writes \"dir\" into another. That seems suspicious because creating files in various paths might be part of establishing persistence or executing commands later. The winlog task is Process Create, which is normal, but the command line is a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a registry value set and image loaded events. The image loaded entries point to system DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so loading them isn't inherently bad. But combined with other events, maybe it's part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with Provider Lifecycle tasks. The command lines here are similar, creating batch files in different directories and setting their content to \"dir\". This repetition might indicate an attempt to create multiple scripts across the system, which could be used for persistence or command execution. The paths have \"..\\\" which might be trying to navigate up directories, possibly to hide the files in parent folders.\n\nAnother image loaded event points to Windows Defender's MpClient.dll. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, maybe there's something wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a process access event, which might be normal, but again, combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of an attack.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated creation of batch files with \"dir\" commands. \"dir\" is a basic command to list directory contents, but if an attacker is creating scripts that run this command, it might be a way to check for the presence of files or directories, possibly as part of a larger malicious payload. The use of PowerShell to create these files in various locations could be an attempt to establish persistence or execute commands later.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity beyond just creating files. The command lines don't have obvious malicious commands like downloading files, executing remote scripts, or modifying system settings. The use of \"dir\" is benign on its own, but the repetition and the paths might be suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the creation of multiple batch files in different directories using PowerShell could be a sign of an attacker trying to leave backdoors or scripts that execute later. The confidence here is moderate because while the actions aren't overtly malicious, the pattern is unusual and could indicate an attempt to establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating and modifying batch files across the system with suspicious paths containing '..\\\\' directory traversals.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. The first few entries show PowerShell.exe being accessed and created. Then there are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain batch files exist. The commands use Test-Path to check for files in various paths. The paths mentioned are a mix of system directories and some custom ones like \"C:\\entrada_principal\" or \"C:\\modulo_geral\". \n\nWait, the fact that PowerShell is checking for these specific batch files might be suspicious. But why? Well, sometimes attackers use PowerShell to check for the presence of files that might be part of their payload or to see if certain conditions are met before executing malicious code. However, just checking for files isn't necessarily malicious. But the repetition of this pattern across multiple entries might indicate some automated process or possibly a script that's trying to locate files in different directories.\n\nThen there's the image loaded events. PowerShell loading .dll files from system directories like Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender. That seems normal, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpClient.dll might be a red flag if it's being loaded in an unusual context. However, the event just says \"Image loaded\" without any other context, so maybe it's part of normal operations.\n\nFile creation and deletion events: There's a temporary file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for scripts. Then it's deleted. That's typical for PowerShell scripts that generate temporary files. The other file created is in the Downloads directory, which might be less suspicious if it's a legitimate file. But the fact that it's being created and then deleted could be part of a cleanup process.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries are about registry value sets. That's probably normal user activity unless there's something specific in the registry keys being modified. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific batch files in non-standard paths. That could be part of a script trying to locate or execute files. However, without seeing the actual content of those batch files or more context on the processes, it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple PowerShell events, combined with file creation and deletion, might indicate some form of automated task or possibly a malicious script. But since the justification needs to be concise, I need to weigh the evidence. The repetition of the Test-Path commands in various paths might be a sign of an attacker probing the system for specific files. However, it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate application's behavior. Given the lack of other obvious malicious indicators (like network connections, unusual processes, etc.), the confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough to consider it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands checking for existence of suspicious batch files in non-standard paths, potentially indicating reconnaissance or payload delivery.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these events step by step. The first two entries show a PowerShell script being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp folder. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving traces.

These checks might be part of a larger script that's trying to locate a keystroke logging script, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nThe repeated use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might indicate some kind of automated or scripted processes. Also, the presence of multiple checks for the same file in different directories suggests the attacker is trying to find where the keystroke logger is stored, possibly to execute it. The fact that the script is being checked in different paths could mean the attacker is trying to bypass defenses by checking multiple locations.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of the keystroke logger being executed or any data exfiltration. The events are mostly about checking file existence and some process accesses.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe being executed with similar command lines. Each of them uses Test-Path to check if a specific file exists and then exits with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned are all in different directories, like \"C:\\registro_principal\\registro_temporario\\registro_secundario\\bin\\componente_secundario.exe\" and others. They also have different tasks like 'Engine Lifecycle', 'Provider Lifecycle', and 'Registry value set'.\n\nNow, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of various files might be normal in some contexts, but it's also a common tactic used by malware to check for the presence of certain files before proceeding. However, just checking file existence isn't necessarily malicious. But combined with the number of such events and the different paths, it could indicate some automated checking or probing.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to 'Image loaded' which mention specific DLLs, like mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. The latter is part of Windows Defender, so that might be legitimate. However, if there's any suspicious activity around those DLLs, that could be a red flag.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' and 'cmd.exe' processes are standard tools, so their presence alone isn't suspicious.

So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and determine if there's any suspicious activity that needs investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are several entries involving PowerShell.exe. Some of them mention file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. For example, there's a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1' and then immediately deleted. That seems odd because creating and deleting a file so quickly might be part of a script trying to execute something without leaving traces. \n\nAnother thing I notice is the command lines in some PowerShell processes. One of them has a command that checks if a certain script exists (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and exits with 0 or 1 based on that. The paths mentioned here are \"C:\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico...\", which look like they might be obfuscated or placeholder paths. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is suspicious because that's a script that could be used to capture keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity.\n\nThere are also multiple instances of 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell.exe, which could indicate that the process is being manipulated or monitored. Additionally, there's a 'Registry value set' event for PowerShell, which might mean that registry keys are being modified, possibly to persist the malware or change system settings.\n\nHowever, there are also some normal activities, like 'whoami.exe' being run, which is a legitimate command to check user identity, and 'calc.exe' and 'notepad.exe' being used. The 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe' entries are also common and might be part of regular system operations. \n\nBut the key red flags here are the repeated PowerShell activities involving file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, the use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, and multiple process access events. These could be indicators of a malicious script trying to execute in memory (like a payload) without leaving files on disk, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs might be normal, but when combined with the other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nI should also check if there are any network connections, but the 'Network connection detected' events are for chrome.exe and svchost.exe, which are usually legitimate. The DNS query from chrome.exe is probably normal browsing activity.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of PowerShell's suspicious file operations, the keystroke logging script, and multiple process access events suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involve creating\/deleting files in temporary directories, including a suspicious script named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' which may indicate keystroke logging.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell executing commands that check if certain files exist. The command lines are similar, using Test-Path to check for .bat files in various directories. The winlog tasks here are things like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. But none of these seem to be immediately suspicious on their own. Checking for files is a common administrative task, so maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. That's a temporary script file. PowerShell often creates such files during execution, especially when running scripts that are blocked by execution policies. The fact that there's a FileCreate event here is normal, but maybe the presence of multiple such files could be a red flag.\n\nAnother event shows a File Delete logged for the same temporary script. That's also common; after running a script, PowerShell might delete the temporary file. But again, this alone isn't suspicious.\n\nThen there's a Registry value set event and a Process Create event. The Process Create event has a command line that checks for an .exe file in a bin directory. The path here is C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe. The presence of multiple Test-Path checks for different files across various directories might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for specific files, maybe looking for existing malicious scripts or binaries.\n\nWait, but all the Test-Path commands are checking for .bat or .exe files. If these files don't exist, the script exits with 1. Maybe the attacker is trying to see if certain files are present, which could be part of a larger attack. However, without seeing actual creation or execution of these files, it's just checking.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of similar patterns. Multiple PowerShell processes are running similar checks across different directories. This could be part of a script that's trying to determine the environment or look for existing payloads. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of multiple temporary script files being created and deleted might be normal, but if there's a high volume or unusual timing, that could be suspicious. However, the logs provided don't indicate any anomalies in timing or volume.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to be in various directories, some of which are in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is a common place for temporary files. The other paths are in system directories, but the Test-Path is just checking existence, not executing them.\n\nI'm not seeing any direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events are all related to normal PowerShell operations, checking for files, creating and deleting temporary scripts. However, the repeated use of Test-Path in different directories might be part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of certain files before proceeding. But without seeing actual execution of malicious files or unusual network activity, it's hard to classify this as interesting.\n\nWait, but the user said to consider the combination of all events. The fact that there are multiple PowerShell processes running similar checks, and the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, might be a sign of something. Maybe the attacker is using these checks to determine if certain conditions are met before proceeding with further actions. However, without more events (like actual execution of the .bat or .exe files, or network connections), it's still not conclusive.\n\nIn the absence of clear malicious activity, but considering the repetitive nature of the checks and the temporary files, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. However, others might see this as normal administrative tasks. The key is that the events don't clearly indicate a security incident, but they do show unusual behavior that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing Test-Path commands to check for existence of files in non-standard directories, potentially probing for payloads or assessing system state.

The files mentioned are mscoree.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are all part of the .NET framework, right? So loading these DLLs might be normal, but maybe there's something else here. However, just loading these files doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity. They could be part of legitimate processes, like running .NET applications. But I should check if there's any unusual activity around these loads.\n\nThen there are several entries where the command line is \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse...}\". The command seems to be using PowerShell to recursively list files. The task here is \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". These tasks might be related to PowerShell providers, which are used for interacting with different data stores. But using ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse is a standard way to list files. However, the repetition of these commands in multiple logs might be a red flag. If this is done multiple times, maybe it's part of a script that's scanning the file system, which could be benign or malicious.\n\nAnother entry is a file created in the user's AppData directory: StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Creating a file there might be normal, but depending on the context. If it's a legitimate profile file, it's okay. But if it's being created by an unexpected process, that could be suspicious. However, the process here is powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file is a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. This might be part of a configuration change, which is normal if the user is setting up or updating winlogbeat. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, the presence of winlogbeat in the logs might be part of the system's monitoring, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nLooking at the registry event where a registry value is set by powershell.exe. Changing registry values can be a sign of malicious activity, but again, it depends on what's being changed. Since the event doesn't specify the key or value, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there's a registry change might be worth investigating.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes loading .NET DLLs, recursively listing files, creating files in AppData and Downloads, and a registry change. The key here is whether these activities are out of the ordinary. If the system is a typical Windows environment with .NET applications and PowerShell being used normally, this might not be interesting. However, if these events are occurring in a context where they shouldn't be, like on a server that doesn't usually have .NET apps, or if the PowerShell commands are part of a script that's exfiltrating data, then it's suspicious.\n\nBut the logs provided don't have any clear indicators of compromise. The PowerShell commands are standard, the files loaded are legitimate, and the file creation might be normal. The registry change is a bit concerning, but without more info, it's hard to say. The repetition of the same command lines might indicate a script that's being run multiple times, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nConsidering that, I think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate user activities. However, the confidence isn't 100% because the registry change and the repeated PowerShell commands could be indicators if there's more context.
