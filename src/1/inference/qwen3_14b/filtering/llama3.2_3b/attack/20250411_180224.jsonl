The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several process creation events. The first one is cmd.exe running a command that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line includes creating a task named \"win32times\" that runs a PowerShell script. The script path is mentioned as c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That might be a red flag because sometimes attackers use names that suggest they don't exist to avoid detection, or maybe it's a typo. But the fact that they're creating a scheduled task with the system user and set to run daily is suspicious. Scheduled tasks running with high privileges can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe creating another task with a similar name, \"win32times\", and a different script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is odd. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account. That's a common technique used in malware to persist on a system.\n\nThen there's an event where svchost.exe creates a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. That path is where scheduled tasks are stored, so creating a task in that directory might be normal, but combined with the previous events, it could be part of an attack. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, so that's not necessarily bad on its own.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe querying the task \"win32times\", which might be normal, but in context, it's part of the setup. The ImageLoad event for taskschd.dll is normal since that's a legitimate Windows file.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of registry value set events and file creations, but most of them involve chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The winlogbeat.yml.new file is part of a log shipper, so maybe that's just configuration changes. However, the chrome.exe events might be benign unless there's something else.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is just checking the user, which is normal. The powershell.exe process being accessed might be part of the scheduled task execution, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with system privileges, using PowerShell scripts that have names suggesting they might not exist, and the repeated use of schtasks to create and query tasks. These are indicators of potential malicious activity aimed at persistence. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these specific actions raises suspicion. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution, but the suspicious task creation and the filenames are red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple schtasks.exe processes create scheduled tasks named 'win32times' with PowerShell scripts referencing non-existent files (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), suggesting potential malicious persistence attempts. The tasks are configured to run daily under the SYSTEM account, which is highly suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
