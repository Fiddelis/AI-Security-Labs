So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's schtasks.exe, whoami.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, and net.exe. Some of these are common utilities, but others like WMIC and PowerShell are often used in attacks. \n\nThe first event is schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal since schtasks is part of the Windows Task Scheduler. But then there's a command line using wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's suspicious because deleting processes isn't typical unless it's part of a cleanup after an attack.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of cmd.exe and PowerShell executing commands related to user deletion, like net user \/del. Deleting user accounts could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation. Also, the use of WMIC to delete processes might be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThe events include registry value sets, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify permissions. The repeated use of cmd.exe and PowerShell with commands that manipulate user accounts and processes suggests potential malicious activity. \n\nHowever, some of these commands could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of multiple suspicious commands, especially the deletion of user accounts and processes, along with the use of tools like WMIC and PowerShell, raises a red flag. \n\nI should check if there's a pattern. The user is deleting multiple admin users across different commands, which might be an attempt to remove access points or cover tracks. Also, the presence of conhost.exe and other system processes might be normal, but the overall activity seems coordinated. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. While some commands are benign, the combination and the nature of the commands (deletion of processes and users) make it likely to be malicious. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of processes (wmic delete notepad.exe), user account deletion commands (net user \/del), and repeated use of PowerShell\/cmd.exe for potentially malicious operations.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit unusual because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating files in startup directories might be part of setting up persistent access. But maybe it's just a normal operation.\n\nNext, there's a process with a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for passwords in various file types. That's definitely a red flag. Searching for passwords in files could indicate an attempt to extract sensitive information. The command is looking through XML, DOC, TXT, and XLS files, which are common places where credentials might be stored. This seems like a potential data exfiltration attempt.\n\nThen there are multiple Chrome.exe events, including DNS queries and network connections. While Chrome doing normal browsing is expected, repeated DNS queries might be part of normal behavior, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger pattern. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe events involve creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be part of its normal operation, especially if it's being set up or updated. Not immediately suspicious unless there's something wrong with the file paths or commands.\n\nAnother PowerShell event creates files named 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. These filenames are generic, but creating multiple files in the Downloads folder might not be suspicious on its own. However, combined with the earlier password search, it could be part of a larger operation.\n\nThe whoami.exe command is run, which just outputs the current user's identity. That's normal, but if it's part of a sequence that's trying to gather information, it could be a step in a larger attack.\n\nThe schtasks.exe commands are deleting scheduled tasks with names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack, removing any previous persistence mechanisms. That's a suspicious activity because it could indicate that the attacker is trying to remove traces of their presence.\n\nPutting it all together: the password search using PowerShell, the deletion of scheduled tasks, and multiple file creations in sensitive directories all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like Chrome's DNS queries), the combination of these events suggests that an attacker might be trying to extract information and remove evidence. The confidence is medium because while some events are suspicious, others are normal. But the presence of multiple suspicious activities together increases the likelihood that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell searching for passwords in files, deletion of scheduled tasks, and creation of files in sensitive directories.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. The main task is to look at all of them together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. The majority of the events are related to 'powershell.exe'. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' and 'password' in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to find passwords in files. But wait, is that necessarily malicious? Maybe it's a legitimate search, but the repetition of the same command line in multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events might indicate something automated or part of a script.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of image loads or unexpected DLLs, that could be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a temporary file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1. The creation and immediate deletion might be part of a script execution, but again, this could be legitimate. However, the fact that it's a PowerShell script might be noteworthy.\n\nLooking at the 'Provider Lifecycle' events, there are multiple entries with the same command line. That repetition could indicate that the script is being run multiple times, perhaps as part of a larger operation. Also, the use of 'select-string' with '-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue' might be an attempt to suppress errors, which is sometimes done in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a 'Pipe Created' event, which might be used for inter-process communication. While that's not inherently malicious, combined with other events, it could be part of a more complex attack.\n\nNow, considering all these points: repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, loading of various DLLs (some from Defender), temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple lifecycle events. The combination might suggest that someone is trying to search for sensitive information on the system, possibly as part of a data exfiltration attempt. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But the fact that the same command is repeated multiple times and the involvement of PowerShell, which is often used in attacks, makes this batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.75. It's not definitive proof of malicious activity, but the combination of events raises enough suspicion to warrant looking into it more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for 'password' patterns across files, combined with repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events and temporary file creation\/deletion, suggest potential credential harvesting or reconnaissance activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are several processes mentioned: cmd.exe, sc.exe, services.exe, whoami.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and calc.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process Create, File Delete logged, Image loaded, and Pipe Created. \n\nHmm, the first event is cmd.exe with a Registry value set. Not sure yet. Then there's sc.exe deleting a service called win32times. Deleting a service might be suspicious, but maybe it's a legitimate action? Then services.exe has a Registry event. Whoami.exe is run, which is normal for checking user identity. \n\nThen powershell.exe appears multiple times with various tasks. One of them is deleting a file in the Temp directory. Also, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be normal, but the repeated entries could be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the file deletes: there's a deletion of a temporary file named tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe and another named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Deleting temporary files isn't necessarily bad, but if they're part of a larger pattern, it could be. \n\nAlso, powershell.exe is loading several .dll files from system directories, which is normal for PowerShell, but the Image Load events might be part of normal operations. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events could be part of a script execution. \n\nThe command line for one cmd.exe includes deleting files with some encoded names, which might be an attempt to clean up after malicious activity. The use of %%temp%% could be a way to reference temporary directories, which is common in scripts but can be part of malicious behavior if combined with other actions. \n\nThe deletion of the service win32times by sc.exe might be an attempt to remove a legitimate service, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the file deletions and multiple PowerShell activities, it could indicate someone trying to remove traces of their actions. \n\nAlso, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell might indicate something unusual, but I'm not entirely sure. The presence of multiple events related to file deletions and registry changes could be part of a larger attack, like trying to disable security software or modify system settings. \n\nPutting it all together: the combination of deleting a service, deleting temporary files, multiple PowerShell activities, and registry changes might be indicative of malicious behavior. However, some of these actions could be legitimate. But since the user is asking for investigation, the presence of these events together might be worth looking into further. \n\nI think the confidence is around 0.65. It's not conclusive, but there are enough suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including service deletion (sc.exe deleting 'win32times'), file deletions in temporary directories, and repeated PowerShell operations with potential cleanup commands.

Let's go through each line one by one.\n\nFirst event: Calculator.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Hmm, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, part of the URLMoniker component. But why is Calculator.exe loading it? Wait, Calculator is a normal app, but maybe if it's doing something unusual. But loading a standard DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in its data directory makes sense. The file path looks like a typical setup for a new installation. Doesn't seem malicious here.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe accessed a process. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but without more context, like if it's executing suspicious commands, it's hard to tell. The event just says \"Process accessed\" but no details on what's being done. Maybe benign.\n\nFourth event: whoami.exe was created. That's a standard command to get user info. The command line is quoted correctly. Seems normal, no red flags here.\n\nFifth and sixth events: Chrome.exe did DNS queries. Chrome doing DNS lookups is normal, especially if it's accessing websites. Two entries might indicate multiple lookups, but without seeing malicious domains, it's hard to say. Still, common activity.\n\nSeventh event: Chrome.exe had a network connection. Again, normal for a browser. No specific details on the destination, so can't tell if it's bad.\n\nPutting it all together: None of the events seem to indicate clear malicious activity. The Calculator and Chrome events are normal operations. The winlogbeat file creation is part of setup. PowerShell and whoami are standard tools. No unusual file paths, no known malicious indicators, no unexpected network activity mentioned. Maybe a bit of a stretch, but nothing that stands out as suspicious. So I'd say NOT INTERESTING, but with moderate confidence because sometimes normal activities can be part of attacks, but in this case, there's no evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal system activity (e.g., legitimate process execution, standard file creation during software installation, routine DNS queries by browser, and benign process access). No suspicious indicators or anomalous behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
