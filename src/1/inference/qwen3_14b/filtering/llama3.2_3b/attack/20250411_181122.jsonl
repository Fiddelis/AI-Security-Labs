{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a 'whoami.exe' process running, which is normal as it's part of Windows. But then there's a 'powershell.exe' process with a command line that's searching for files containing passwords. The command uses findstr and select-string to look through various file types like .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls. That seems suspicious because it's trying to find sensitive information.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for 'powershell.exe' with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might be part of normal operations, but the repetition could indicate something automated. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory, which is often a sign of malicious activity trying to hide its tracks.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory might be related to log collection, but it's not immediately alarming. However, the multiple instances of PowerShell executing the same command could be part of a script trying to gather sensitive data. The presence of 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender might be normal, but if these are being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the 'svchost.exe' entries with registry value changes, that's typically normal for system services, but without more context, it's hard to say. The 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' processes loading 'urlmon.dll' are standard, so probably benign.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious points are the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the potential for data exfiltration. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these activities raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing commands to search for files containing 'password' across various document types, combined with temporary file creation\/deletion and repeated process events, suggest potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: OfficeClickToRun.exe with a DNS query. That's part of Microsoft Office, so maybe normal, but not sure yet. Next, there's a PowerShell command that searches for files with 'pass' in their names, like looking for passwords. That seems suspicious. It's using findstr and select-string to search through various file types. That could be part of a password-gathering attempt.\n\nThen there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Maybe that's just a normal profile, but sometimes attackers use startup scripts. Then Chrome.exe has several events: pipe created, DNS queries, registry changes, and loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files, but maybe the registry changes are noteworthy. The network connections from Chrome might be normal browsing, but not sure.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe created a new YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of monitoring, but if it's in the Downloads folder, maybe someone installed it manually. Then there's whoami.exe, which just gets user info, not too bad. The cmd.exe and schtasks.exe commands are deleting scheduled tasks. That could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity. Deleting tasks named things like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" might be part of cleaning up.\n\nThe WMIC.exe command is deleting notepad.exe processes. That's a bit odd. Why delete notepad? Maybe it's part of a larger attack, or maybe it's a false positive. But combining all these: the PowerShell searching for passwords, deleting scheduled tasks, and using WMIC to kill processes could indicate an attacker trying to gather info and cover their tracks.\n\nBut wait, some of these might be normal. For example, Chrome loading amsi.dll is normal. However, the combination of multiple suspicious activities—searching for passwords, deleting tasks, using WMIC—might point to malicious behavior. The confidence isn't 100% because some actions could be legitimate, but the overall pattern seems concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell command searching for passwords in files, deletion of scheduled tasks, and WMIC process deletion. These actions may indicate data exfiltration or cleanup post-compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs carefully. The first event stands out: WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That's unusual because Windows Defender's files shouldn't be loaded by WMIC, which is typically used for remote management. The path mentioned, MpOAV.dll, is part of Microsoft Defender's Antivirus, so this might be a malicious DLL being loaded, possibly to bypass security measures.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of cmd.exe and net.exe deleting user accounts. Commands like \"net user \/del\" are used to remove users, which could be part of an attack to eliminate administrative accounts or other users. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a red flag, as it's not a standard Windows executable. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate user accounts to gain persistence or remove evidence.\n\nPowerShell.exe being accessed repeatedly might be part of the attack's execution phase, but without more details on the commands, it's hard to tell. However, the combination with the user deletions and the suspicious DLL loading suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nThe sc.exe command deleting a service (win32times) could be an attempt to remove a service that's being used for malicious purposes or to clean up after an attack. Deleting services is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nOther events like Registry value sets and process creations don't show immediate signs of malicious intent on their own, but when combined with the above, they form a pattern. The key indicators here are the unusual DLL loading, user account deletions, and service deletion. These actions are often seen in attacks where the attacker is trying to escalate privileges, remove traces, or manipulate system configurations.\n\nI should check if any of these processes are part of legitimate system activities. For example, WMIC can be used legitimately, but loading a Defender DLL through it is suspicious. Similarly, deleting user accounts could be part of a legitimate script, but the repetition and combination with other events make it more likely malicious.\n\nOverall, the combination of these events points towards a potential security threat, warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) WMIC.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory (potential DLL hijacking or evasion technique). 2) Repeated use of 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' to delete user accounts (possible account removal for privilege escalation or evidence cleanup). 3) 'sc.exe' deleting a service (win32times) which may indicate post-exploitation cleanup. 4) PowerShell and cmd.exe usage patterns suggesting lateral movement or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about 'cmd.exe' deleting a file in the Temp directory. The file path is 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe'. That seems suspicious because Temp directories are common places for malware to hide, and deleting a file might be part of cleaning up after an attack.\n\nThen there are several entries related to 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a normal command to check user privileges, but if it's run multiple times, maybe it's part of reconnaissance. However, alone, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity with 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The logs show process creation, access, and image loading. Some of the image loads are to system files like mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of .NET and Windows Defender, so they're legitimate. But the fact that PowerShell is loading these might be normal.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1'. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. That's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the command line for some PowerShell processes is '& {}', which is an empty command. That might be a placeholder or part of a larger script that's not shown here. It's not harmful on its own, but combined with other events, it might be part of a more complex attack.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: there's a deletion of a file in Temp, multiple PowerShell activities, and some file creation\/deletion in Temp. The presence of 'cmd.exe' and 'whoami.exe' might be part of initial access or privilege escalation. However, without more context, like network activity or other suspicious processes, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nBut the key points here are the file deletion in Temp and the PowerShell script file being created and deleted. Those could indicate an attacker trying to execute a script and then clean up. However, since there's no evidence of the script actually being executed or malicious content in the files, it might be a false positive or a benign process. But the combination of these events is enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell-related events with file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, potential script execution artifacts, and process access attempts.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. The first two entries are about 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. Wait, 'urlmon.dll' is a legitimate Windows DLL, part of the URL Moniker, used by Internet Explorer and other applications. But why are these processes loading it? 'calc.exe' is the calculator, which is normal, but 'Calculator.exe' might be a typo or a different process. However, both are standard processes, so maybe nothing wrong here.\n\nNext, 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring and shipping logs. The file path seems normal, and creating a .yml.new file could be part of configuration setup. Not suspicious unless there's unexpected behavior, but this looks okay.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' with a ProcessAccess event. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but it's also a normal admin tool. Without more context, like command-line arguments or unusual activities, it's hard to tell. The event mentions 'Process accessed' but no details on what was accessed. Maybe not enough info here.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries include DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries and network connects are normal for a browser. However, if there were unusual domains or connections to known bad IPs, that would be a red flag. But in the given data, there's no such info. Just the event types and process names.\n\nPutting it all together: The events include normal system activities. The only thing that stands out is the 'Calculator.exe' process, but that might be a typo. The rest are standard processes doing typical actions. No signs of malware or suspicious behavior. So, maybe this batch isn't interesting. But I should check if any of the events are out of place. For example, if 'urlmon.dll' was loaded from an unexpected location, but the path here is the standard System32 directory. So, all seems legitimate. Therefore, classification would be NOT INTERESTING with low confidence because there's nothing suspicious here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (calc.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe) performing normal operations (loading system DLLs, DNS queries, file creation).
