The event shows that powershell.exe was accessed, and the winlog task is \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". The file is None, which might mean no file was involved here.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is interesting. PowerShell is a common tool, but it's also often used in attacks. The ProcessAccess rule might be part of a security monitoring system. However, with just one event, there's not much to go on. The fact that the file is None could indicate that the process was started without accessing a file, which might be normal. But maybe the process access is part of a larger pattern. However, since this is a single event, it's hard to tell. The confidence would be low because there's insufficient data. The justification would be that a single event isn't enough to determine malicious activity, but it's noted for further investigation. So classification is \"INTERESTING\" but with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A single process access event for powershell.exe is not inherently malicious, but may warrant further investigation as PowerShell is commonly abused in attacks.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing a DNS query, powershell.exe accessing a process, whoami.exe being executed. Those alone might not be suspicious. But then there's cmd.exe using certutil to encode and decode files. Wait, certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding files, but when combined with commands like this, it can be part of data exfiltration or malicious payload delivery. \n\nLooking at the command line for cmd.exe: it's using certutil -encode on calc.exe and then decoding it into a temp file. That seems odd because calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but encoding it and then decoding might be a way to obfuscate malicious content. Also, there are multiple instances of certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. \n\nThen there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\registro_geral_calc_decoded.exe and another executable detected there. That's a red flag because creating executables in temp folders is common in malware to avoid detection. Also, the use of cmd.exe and certutil in such a way could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the presence of rundll32.exe executing a command related to PcaSvc.dll. While PcaSvc.dll is a legitimate Windows component, using rundll32 with it might be part of a malicious payload if the parameters are unusual. However, the command here seems to be a legitimate task (PcaPatchSdbTask), so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll â€“ those are standard system DLLs, so image loading there might be normal. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be an issue. But the logs don't mention SDXHelper.exe's origin, so I can't be sure.\n\nThe powershell.exe creating a file in Downloads is normal unless the file is malicious. But the filename is \"componente_auxiliar.txt\" which doesn't immediately look harmful. However, combined with other events, it might be part of a larger scheme.\n\nThe multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe might be benign, but if they're modifying critical keys, that could be a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding files, creation of executables in temp directories, and the combination of cmd.exe and certutil commands are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe are common, the specific commands and file operations here are suspicious. The confidence is high because the pattern matches known techniques used in malware, like using certutil for data encoding and executing payloads from temp files.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (common in malware), creation of executable files in temporary directories, and unusual process combinations (cmd.exe with certutil, rundll32 with PcaSvc.dll). These patterns align with known malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
