Notably, there are repeated registry modifications and image loading events involving WMIC.exe and svchost.exe with the same file path (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\urlmon.dll), which could suggest DLL hijacking attempts. Additionally, the use of WMIC.exe and cmd.exe for setting registry values is unusual in typical legitimate operations. The presence of PowerShell accessing processes multiple times may indicate lateral movement or script execution. These patterns together warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
