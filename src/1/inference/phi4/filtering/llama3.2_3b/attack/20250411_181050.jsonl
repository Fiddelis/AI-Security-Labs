The use of 'certutil.exe' to encode and decode files, particularly involving system executables like calc.exe, is a common tactic used by malware for obfuscation.

Multiple registry modifications by 'chrome.exe', alongside network connections, could indicate persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
