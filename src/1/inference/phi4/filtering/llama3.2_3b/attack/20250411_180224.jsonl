The creation and scheduling of tasks using 'schtasks.exe' to execute non-existing PowerShell scripts are suspicious, as they could be attempts to hide malicious code execution. Additionally, the repeated use of 'cmd.exe' for similar actions reinforces this suspicion. Other events involve processes like 'winlogbeat.exe', which is generally benign but noteworthy when combined with other suspicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
