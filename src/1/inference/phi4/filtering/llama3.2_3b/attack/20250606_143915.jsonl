The use of cmd.exe to delete a file named 'lsass_dump.dmp' in the Windows Temp directory raises suspicion as it suggests an attempt to erase potential evidence related to credential theft or privilege escalation activities (dumping LSASS). Additionally, repeated accesses and creations involving powershell.exe and whoami.exe indicate possible reconnaissance or privilege escalation efforts.
