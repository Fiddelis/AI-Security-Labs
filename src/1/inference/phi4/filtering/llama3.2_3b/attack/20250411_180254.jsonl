The use of 'powershell.exe' for file creation and process access, along with suspicious command line activities from 'cmd.exe', such as querying the registry at HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Disk\\\\Enum, suggests attempts to gather sensitive system information or modify critical settings.
