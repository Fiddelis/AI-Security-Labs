These parameters are standard for an Electron-based application like Discord.\n\n4. **Consistency**: The pattern observed is consistent with routine updates and application execution without any anomalies or indications of malicious activity such as unusual paths, suspicious executables, or unexpected network activities.\n\n5. **Pipe Events**: The creation of pipes between processes (e.g., `Discord.exe`) is a typical inter-process communication method used in applications like Discord for internal operations.\n\nGiven these observations and the lack of any red flags or anomalies indicative of malicious behavior, the batch is classified as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence."}
