This executable is often associated with Microsoft Office applications for deployment and configuration tasks, but its activity here seems excessive and potentially suspicious.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Path Patterns**: All created files reside in a directory under `Office\\\\SolutionPackages`, indicating they may be part of an update or patch mechanism. However, the repeated creation of similar-named JavaScript files with different suffixes is unusual for typical Office operations and suggests potential data manipulation or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Duplicated Files**: The logs show some JavaScript file names being created multiple times with identical paths but possibly different content identifiers, hinting at possible attempts to hide malicious activities through duplication.\n\n4. **Process Activity Involvement**: While `SDXHelper.exe` is generally a legitimate process used by Office, the level of activity here suggests it might be compromised or misused. Additionally, there are logs involving `chrome.exe`, which modify the registry and load certain system DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `MpClient.dll`). This combination can indicate malicious intent, such as persistence mechanisms or attempts to evade security software.\n\n5. **Registry Modification**: Changes made by a browser process (like `chrome.exe`) to the Windows registry are uncommon and could point towards an attempt to establish persistence or disable security features.\n\nBased on these factors, the batch warrants further investigation due to potential indications of malicious behavior. The classification is \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence (0.85) reflecting the unusual patterns that merit attention in a cybersecurity context."}
