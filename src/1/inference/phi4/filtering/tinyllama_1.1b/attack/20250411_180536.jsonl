Additionally, 'services.exe' is repeatedly setting registry values, potentially suggesting an attempt to modify system configurations without user consent. The use of 'sc.exe' to start a service ('elemento_auxiliar') also raises concerns as this command is often used in persistence mechanisms by malware.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
