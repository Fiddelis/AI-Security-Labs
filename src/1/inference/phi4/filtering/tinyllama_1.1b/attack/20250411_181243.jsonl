{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing commands to gather system and user information, indicating potential reconnaissance or lateral movement activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\nThe batch of events indicates suspicious activity primarily due to the repeated use of `powershell.exe` to execute a series of system enumeration commands such as `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember -group Users`, and others that are commonly associated with reconnaissance activities in cybersecurity contexts. These actions are indicative of an attempt to map out users, groups, and credentials on the affected machine.\n\nFurther signs pointing towards malicious intent include:\n\n1. **File Deletion**: An event logs a file deletion at `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`, potentially aimed at removing traces of execution or scripts.\n   \n2. **Repeated Commands Execution**: The batch contains repeated command executions using PowerShell, which suggests automated behavior often seen in scripts used by attackers to perform reconnaissance systematically.\n\n3. **Use of `net.exe` and other system tools**: The use of additional system utilities such as `net.exe` further corroborates the intent to probe network user configurations.\n\n4. **File operations and process creations**: Other events include file creation (`winlogbeat.exe`) and image loadings for critical Windows components, which may suggest preparation or post-activity cleanup by an attacker trying to evade detection.\n\nGiven these observations, the combination of events strongly suggests malicious behavior worthy of further investigation. The confidence level is set high due to multiple corroborating indicators of potentially unauthorized access attempts."}
