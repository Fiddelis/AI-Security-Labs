The first event shows an image load for backgroundTaskHost.exe, which could be benign or indicative of malware activity, particularly if the loaded DLL is uncommon in that context (urlmon.dll). The second event involves file creation by winlogbeat.exe, typically benign but noteworthy if unusual. The third event indicates process access by powershell.exe without any file context, raising concerns due to PowerShell's frequent use in script-based attacks.
