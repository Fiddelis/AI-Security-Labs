The repeated file creation events for `.winlogbeat.yml.new` indicate potential tampering or setup activities, especially considering that winlogbeat is not typically run by users themselves. Registry modifications by `conhost.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` add to the suspicion as these processes should not usually modify registry values.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
