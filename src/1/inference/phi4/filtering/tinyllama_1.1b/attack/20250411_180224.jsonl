The use of 'schtasks.exe' to query tasks and the repeated creation of files by 'winlogbeat.exe' suggest possible legitimate operations but warrant further investigation due to potential misuse for scheduling malicious tasks. Additionally, 'powershell.exe' creating files and accessing processes can be a sign of automation or scripting activities that could be benign or malicious depending on context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
