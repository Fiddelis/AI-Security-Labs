The repeated process access to 'powershell.exe' could indicate command execution or script automation, while the image load event related to 'MpClient.dll' suggests potential tampering attempts. Additionally, a special logon event is present without a clear user action context, which can imply unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
