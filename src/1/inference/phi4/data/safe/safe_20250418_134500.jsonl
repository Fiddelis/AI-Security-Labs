{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"The log entries you provided appear to be from a Windows system event log, possibly using tools like WinLogbeat and various applications such as Microsoft Edge and RuntimeBroker. Here's an overview of the activities captured:\n\n1. **WinLogbeat Activity**:\n   - A process `winlogbeat.exe` is created, indicating that the winlogbeat application has been started.\n   - It logs its activity to a file named `winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`.\n\n2. **Microsoft Edge Update Process (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe)**:\n   - The system attempts to update or access Microsoft Edge components.\n   - The process accesses and loads various image files associated with the Microsoft Edge update mechanism.\n   - There are multiple entries indicating network connections made by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, suggesting it's communicating over the network, likely for updates.\n   - The process is terminated several times during its execution.\n\n3. **Runtime Broker**:\n   - This process sets registry values, which could be related to app permissions or other configurations managed by the Windows Runtime Broker.\n\n4. **File Creation Logs**:\n   - Several `.etl` files (Event Trace Log) are created and stored in `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate`. These files record detailed events associated with Windows Update processes.\n\n5. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - The process `powershell.exe` is accessed, which may be related to the execution of scripts or commands that could be part of update or configuration tasks.\n\nThese logs suggest routine activities such as application updates and system monitoring\/logging using tools like WinLogbeat. However, frequent termination of processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` might warrant further investigation if it leads to functionality issues or repeated failures in completing updates."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This data appears to be a series of logs generated by Windows Event Forwarding (WEF), specifically focusing on file and process-related events, such as file creation, deletion, and registry changes, along with some network activity like DNS queries. Here's an overview of what the log entries indicate:\n\n1. **File Creation Events:**\n   - Multiple files are created under different paths, including temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`), the `winlogbeat` data directory, and others related to system services like `DeliveryOptimization`.\n   - For instance, a file named `{56EB03CF-7B20-4F17-BBF5-FE2A4B0DF99C}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` is created in the temporary directory by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.\n\n2. **File Deletion Events:**\n   - A file, `{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179_73_135.0.3179.66.exe`, is logged as deleted in the temporary directory.\n\n3. **Process Creation Events:**\n   - Various processes are started, such as `svchost.exe`, `Explorer.EXE`, and `notepad.exe`.\n   - For example, `notepad.exe` is launched from its system32 directory with no command-line arguments.\n\n4. **Registry Changes:**\n   - An event indicates that a registry value was set by `Explorer.EXE`.\n\n5. **Network Activity:**\n   - A DNS query is performed by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, although the specifics of the domain queried are not detailed in this snippet.\n\n6. **Pipe Creation Events:**\n   - `setup.exe` creates an inter-process communication pipe, which could be part of its installation routine.\n\n7. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The logs cover system maintenance activities such as Windows Update (`C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate`) logging.\n   - There are updates and installations related to Microsoft Edge, tracked by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.\n\nThese entries provide a snapshot of the security-relevant operations occurring on the machine, which can be useful for monitoring system behavior, detecting unauthorized actions, or troubleshooting issues. If you need more detailed analysis, tools like Splunk or ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) are typically used to ingest and analyze these logs further."}
