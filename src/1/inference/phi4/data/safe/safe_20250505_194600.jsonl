Notably, there are repeated file creation events by 'winlogbeat.exe' which may suggest an attempt to hide or alter configurations. The command line execution for 'rundll32.exe' with a specific GUID might indicate the presence of a potentially unwanted program or malware trying to embed itself. Additionally, 'notepad.exe', typically a benign process, is involved in actions like file creation and image loading from unusual locations such as System32, which could be indicative of process hollowing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
