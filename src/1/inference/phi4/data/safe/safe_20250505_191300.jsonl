While normal for a communication app, the frequency and context with other suspicious activities warrant investigation.\n\n- **File Creation Time Changes:** There are logs indicating changes in file creation times within the Discord directory. This could be indicative of tampering or data manipulation attempts.\n\n- **Registry Modification:** The log includes an event where `Discord.exe` sets a registry value, which might suggest attempts to persist changes or configurations that could be malicious.\n\n- **Process Access Events:** Multiple process access events are logged, indicating potential probing for vulnerabilities or misuse of the process's capabilities.\n\nOverall, while some activities can be benign, the combination and context of these events make this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence level reflects the ambiguity inherent in interpreting such logs without additional contextual information."}
