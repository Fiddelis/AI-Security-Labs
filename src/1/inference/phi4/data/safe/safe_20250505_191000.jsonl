By themselves, they are not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n- **EXCEL.EXE Process Events**:\n  - The event where `EXCEL.EXE` loads a DLL (`coml2.dll`) from an unusual location (`C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32`) raises suspicion as this is not typical behavior for Excel.\n  - Multiple DNS queries initiated by `EXCEL.EXE`, without corresponding legitimate network activity, are atypical and suggest potential misuse or compromise (e.g., command and control communication).\n  - Creation of a `.LNK` file (`real_values.csv.LNK`) in the Recent folder is unusual. LNK files can be used maliciously to create shortcuts for executing scripts or binaries.\n\n- The combination of these events, particularly those involving `EXCEL.EXE`, suggests potential manipulation or compromise of the system, warranting further investigation. The confidence level reflects reasonable suspicion based on the described anomalies but acknowledges that not all details are fully conclusive without additional context."}
