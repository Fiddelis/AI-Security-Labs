{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell, such as taking screenshots and accessing registry values, combined with unusual behavior from Chrome, including numerous registry modifications and loading critical system images.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n``` \n\nThis classification is based on the following observations:\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: \n   - A PowerShell script for capturing a screenshot is detected (`Add-Type`, `Bitmap`, etc.), which can be indicative of reconnaissance or data exfiltration efforts.\n   - Multiple instances where `powershell.exe` sets registry values, accesses processes, and runs from non-standard startup paths raise red flags about potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Unusual Chrome Behavior**:\n   - The high frequency of registry value modifications by `chrome.exe`, which is atypical behavior for a benign browser process.\n   - Loading critical system images (`amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) through `chrome.exe` suggests possible attempts to bypass security features or inject malicious code.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Activity Patterns**:\n   - The combination of these activities across different processes (PowerShell, Chrome) within a short timeframe implies coordinated efforts potentially aimed at compromising the system or maintaining persistence after an initial breach.\n\nThe confidence level is set high but not perfect due to potential false positives and lack of context about the legitimacy of some actions in specific environments."}
