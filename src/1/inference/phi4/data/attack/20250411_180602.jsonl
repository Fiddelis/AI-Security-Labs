{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and suspicious process behaviors involving powershell.exe, along with system file access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Multiple Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`:**  \n   - There are numerous events showing that `chrome.exe` is setting registry values multiple times. This unusual behavior from a browser process could indicate an attempt to persist malicious changes or alter system settings.\n\n2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**  \n   - The logs show `powershell.exe` creating files and accessing processes, which can be indicative of script-based attacks or lateral movement attempts.\n   \n3. **Uncommon Process Creation:**\n   - A standalone execution of `whoami.exe` is noted. While typically benign, its isolated mention with full path execution could hint at reconnaissance activities.\n\n4. **Access to System Files:**\n   - The log shows system files like `amsi.dll` and Windows Defender components being loaded by a process. Manipulation or bypass attempts involving these files can suggest an effort to evade security controls.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity, making the batch relevant for further investigation with high confidence."}
