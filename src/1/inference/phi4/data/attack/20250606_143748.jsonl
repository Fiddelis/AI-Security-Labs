{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts using bypass techniques, and downloading of potentially malicious code from an external URL. This pattern suggests possible exploitation activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **PowerShell Execution with Bypass Techniques**: Several entries show `powershell.exe` being executed with `-exec bypass`, which is a technique commonly used to evade execution policy restrictions, often indicative of malicious intent.\n\n2. **File and Registry Modifications**:\n   - Files are created in user profiles (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`).\n   - A registry value is set without specifying the target, which could be related to persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Code Downloading**: There are instances where PowerShell commands download scripts from an external URL (`https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn`). This script, `WinPwn.ps1`, is known for its use in exploiting Windows systems and gathering sensitive information.\n\n4. **Multiple Provider Lifecycle Events**: A high number of `Provider Lifecycle` events with the same PowerShell command line further suggest automated script execution, potentially part of an attack or reconnaissance activity.\n\n5. **User Account Management Events**: These might indicate changes to user accounts, possibly related to establishing persistence or privilege escalation by the attacker.\n\nOverall, these activities combined strongly indicate a scenario where system compromise and exploitation attempts are underway. Hence, it warrants further investigation to confirm malicious actions and mitigate any potential threats. The confidence level is high due to clear indicators of compromise and established patterns associated with known attack methodologies."}
