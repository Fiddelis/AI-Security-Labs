While legitimate applications might occasionally modify the registry, such frequent and consistent changes are atypical for standard browser behavior.\n\n2. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - Multiple modifications by a single process suggest that it could be doing something out of its ordinary scope, possibly indicative of an infection or malicious script execution.\n   - `chrome.exe` is often impersonated in attacks; thus, verifying these actions against expected behavior for Google Chrome is critical.\n\n3. **Contextual Considerations:**\n   - If the modifications are to sensitive parts of the registry (e.g., startup keys), it may imply attempts at persistence or privilege escalation.\n   - The lack of additional file-related events limits insight into what specific changes are being made, increasing uncertainty and risk perception.\n\n4. **Confidence Level:** The confidence level is set at 0.8 due to the pattern of unusual behavior observed with `chrome.exe`, though definitive conclusions require further investigation, potentially involving checking against known good configurations or using threat intelligence for validation."}
