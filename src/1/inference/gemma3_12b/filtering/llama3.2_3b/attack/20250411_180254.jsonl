Specifically, multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` executing commands like `systeminfo` and querying the registry (HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Disk\\\\Enum), which could be used for information gathering.  There's a `powershell.exe` creating a file 'objeto_padrao.txt', potentially indicating scripting or data exfiltration.  Combined with the registry modifications and process creation events, this warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
