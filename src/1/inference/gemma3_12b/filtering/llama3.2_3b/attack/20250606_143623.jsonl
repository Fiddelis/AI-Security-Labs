{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the provided data, focusing on the key actions and potential implications:\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThe data appears to represent the execution of a PowerShell script designed to create and start a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo.\" This service, in turn, executes a binary file located at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe.\"\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Events**\n\n*   **Event 1 (Data 1):** The `file` information looks corrupted\/encoded. There are a lot of unusual characters.\n    *   **process** = `\"None\"`\n    *   **winlog**= `\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\"`\n    *   **file** = Encoded data\n*   **Event 2 (Data 2):**\n    *   **process** = `\"None\"`\n    *   **winlog** = `\"{'task': 'None'}\"`\n    *   **file** = `\"None\"`\n*   **Event 3-5 (Data 3-5):**  This is the core of the activity. These events show a PowerShell script being run.\n    *   **process**:  PowerShell is used to create the service (`New-Service`) and then starts it (`Start-Service`).\n    *   **winlog**:  Indicates a provider lifecycle event.\n    *   **file**:  The binary path is `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  This file is the executable that the created service will run.\n\n**Potential Implications & Concerns**\n\n*   **Service Creation & Execution:**  The script is creating and starting a Windows service. This is a significant change to the system and could be malicious if done without proper authorization.\n*   **Obfuscation:** The data looks somewhat obfuscated, which is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection.\n*   **Suspicious File Path:** `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` - The long, unusual file path raises suspicion. It's unlikely to be a standard Windows system file. This path could indicate a custom file dropped by an attacker.\n*   **Service Name:** The service name \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\") is generic and potentially misleading.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   **Investigate `tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is the most critical step. Determine its origin, purpose, and legitimacy.  Examine it with antivirus, malware analysis tools, and ideally, reverse engineer its functionality.\n*   **Review Service Configuration:**  Examine the properties of the \"objeto_ativo\" service: startup type, user account it runs as, description, etc.\n*   **Audit PowerShell Script:**  If you can access the original PowerShell script, carefully review its contents for any malicious code or unexpected behavior.\n*   **Check System Logs:**  Look for other related events in the Windows Event Logs that might shed light on the source of this activity and the reason for the service creation.\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Scan:** Run a comprehensive scan with an EDR solution to detect any related artifacts.\n\n**Important Note:** The encoded data in the first event requires careful analysis.  Attempting to decode the data may reveal valuable information."}
