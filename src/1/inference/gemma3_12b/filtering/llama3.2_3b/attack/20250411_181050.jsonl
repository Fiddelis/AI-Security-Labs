This strongly suggests a potential obfuscation or delivery mechanism for malicious code, as `certutil` is often abused for this purpose. The frequent use of PowerShell, coupled with the `certutil` activity, raises suspicion of malicious intent. The presence of `SDXHelper.exe` and repeated `chrome.exe` registry modifications also contribute to an environment requiring investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
