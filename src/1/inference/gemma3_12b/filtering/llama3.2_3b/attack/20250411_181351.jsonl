This behavior, combined with registry access and DLL loading (mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll), strongly suggests potential screen capture activity, which is often associated with remote access trojans (RATs) or keyloggers.  The repetitive nature of the command-line indicates a possible automated process. The consistent use of `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms` also points to a malicious actor attempting to utilize screen capture functionality.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
