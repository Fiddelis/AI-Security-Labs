The frequent use of PowerShell, combined with the PowerShell command execution patterns, the loading of .NET framework libraries (mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll), and the deletion of a temporary PowerShell script, strongly suggest potential malicious activity like reconnaissance or execution of a larger attack chain.
