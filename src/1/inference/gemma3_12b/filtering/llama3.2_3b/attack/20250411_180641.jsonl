Furthermore, numerous .exe files are dynamically loading .NET runtime components (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll).  The filenames are also unusual and suggest a potentially obfuscated process. Multiple `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe` events with registry modifications add to the concern, although not inherently malicious on their own. The combination of these factors warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
