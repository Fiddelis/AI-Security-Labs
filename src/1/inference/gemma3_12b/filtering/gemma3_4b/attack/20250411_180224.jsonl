The scripts refer to files with unusual names like `objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1` and `entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`, suggesting potential malicious activity. Furthermore, tasks are being created and queried, pointing to automation and possible persistence mechanisms.  The creation of a scheduled task named 'win32times' is repeated with varying command lines, indicating a potential attempt to hide the malicious behavior. Finally, repeated Registry and file events are observed across various processes (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe) which could represent privilege escalation attempts or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
