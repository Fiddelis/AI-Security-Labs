{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events strongly suggests a malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and why it's concerning:\n\n**1. Initial Execution (Task Scheduler):**\n\n* **`services.exe`:**  A legitimate Windows process. Its presence here likely means it was triggered by a scheduled task.\n* **`sppsvc.exe` + `taskschd.dll`:**  This indicates the execution is originating from the Task Scheduler service.  The DLL loaded (`taskschd.dll`) confirms this.  A scheduled task is the likely trigger for the script.\n* **`svchost.exe`:** A legitimate Windows process that hosts other services. Its presence is likely related to the scheduled task execution.\n\n**2. PowerShell Launch and Activity:**\n\n* **`powershell.exe` (multiple occurrences):** PowerShell is being launched repeatedly. This is a major red flag.\n* **`whoami.exe`:**  The script is determining the user's identity. This can be used for privilege escalation or to target specific users.\n* **`powershell.exe` (removing ZIP file):**  The crucial command: `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`. This deletes a ZIP file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory. This is likely the payload â€“ the malicious code that was downloaded and then being removed to cover its tracks.  The `-Force` parameter bypasses confirmation prompts.\n* **`.NET` DLL loading:**  `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and other `.NET` DLLs are loaded. This suggests the malicious script uses the .NET framework, allowing for more complex operations and potentially obfuscation.  The loading of `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` confirms PowerShell is utilizing the .NET Framework.\n* **`Windows Defender` DLL loaded (MpOAV.dll):** This suggests that some code from Windows Defender may be being used\/called by the malicious script, potentially as part of evasion techniques.\n* **Temporary Script Creation & Deletion:** The creation and immediate deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` in the user's temporary directory is a common technique to evade detection and forensic analysis.  This is a PowerShell script creation test, ensuring the system's PowerShell execution policy is configured in a way that allows script execution.\n\n**Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n* **Scheduled Task Trigger:**  The use of the Task Scheduler indicates a planned and potentially persistent infection.\n* **File Deletion:**  The deletion of `entrada_principal.zip` is a clear attempt to remove traces of the malware.\n* **PowerShell Utilization:**  PowerShell is a favorite tool for attackers due to its versatility and ability to bypass security controls.\n* **Temporary File Creation & Deletion:** This is a common obfuscation technique.\n* **.NET Framework Usage:** Increases complexity and potential for evasion.\n* **Windows Defender DLL Loading:** Possible evasion technique.\n\n**Possible Next Steps & Recommendations:**\n\n* **Investigate the Scheduled Task:** Immediately examine the Task Scheduler to identify the exact scheduled task that's executing this script.  Disable or delete it.\n* **Scan System:** Run a full system scan with an updated anti-virus\/anti-malware solution.\n* **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:** Check the PowerShell Execution Policy to ensure it's not overly permissive.\n* **Examine User's Temporary Directory:**  Check the contents of the user's temporary directory for any other suspicious files.\n* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) System:**  If available, utilize an EDR system to investigate the incident further and identify any other compromised systems.\n* **Network Monitoring:** Review network traffic for suspicious connections or data exfiltration attempts.\n* **Forensic Analysis:** If the severity of the incident is high, consider a more detailed forensic analysis of the compromised system.\n\n\n\n**In conclusion, this is a clear indication of a malicious PowerShell script execution. Immediate action is required to contain the threat and prevent further damage.**"}
