{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this log data. It appears to be a PowerShell-related incident, and it involves a potentially malicious script being executed. Here's a summary and analysis:\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThe log sequence describes a PowerShell script being downloaded and executed. The script is designed to remove a file (likely a download) and then attempts to remove temporary files from the user's temp folder. The process involves downloading, executing, and cleaning up evidence. The script likely has a nefarious purpose.\n\n**Detailed Analysis & Key Observations**\n\n1.  **Process Creation & Execution:**\n    *   Several `Process Create` events for `powershell.exe` indicate the script is being invoked and executed.\n    *   A command line for `powershell.exe` includes a file removal operation (`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`). This suggests the script is attempting to delete a file named \"entrada\\_principal.zip\" from the user's temporary directory. The `-Force` flag indicates that the deletion will happen without confirmation.\n\n2.  **Image Loading:**\n    *   Multiple `Image Load` events for `powershell.exe` show it's loading various DLLs from Windows and .NET directories. This is normal for PowerShell, but it shows the script is using the .NET framework for its operations.  `mscoree.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`, and `clr.dll` are core .NET components. The loading of `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` indicates use of PowerShell's automation features. Loading the `MpOAV.dll` related to Windows Defender is notable; this script might be attempting to evade detection.\n\n3.  **File Activity:**\n    *   `File created`: A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) is created in the user's `AppData\\Local\\Temp` folder. This is likely the downloaded script being written to disk.\n    *   `File Delete logged`: The same temporary PowerShell script is deleted from the same location. This is an attempt to remove traces of the downloaded script, a classic cleanup tactic.\n\n**Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n*   **Filename:** `entrada_principal.zip` - The name of the file being deleted suggests what the script was initially intended to download and execute.  Further investigation into this filename is crucial.  What is `entrada_principal.zip` supposed to be?\n*   **Temp Folder Activity:**  Excessive activity in the user's temp folder is a common sign of malicious scripts.\n*   **Script Policy Bypass:** The presence of the temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) could suggest an attempt to bypass PowerShell script execution policy.\n*   **Windows Defender DLL load:** The DLL `MpOAV.dll` might indicate a script trying to evade Windows Defender.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Investigate `entrada_principal.zip`:** Determine the intended purpose and origin of this file. If it's unknown, treat it as malicious.\n2.  **Examine User Account:** Investigate the user account (\"fiddelis\") involved.  What has this user been doing? Are there any other suspicious activities associated with this account?\n3.  **Scan the System:** Perform a full system scan with an updated antivirus\/anti-malware solution.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:** Ensure that PowerShell execution policy is configured appropriately to restrict script execution.\n5.  **Monitor Temp Folder:** Implement monitoring on the user's temp folder to detect unusual activity.\n6.  **Analyze the PowerShell Script:** If possible, retrieve and analyze the contents of the temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) to understand the script's full functionality.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n*   This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A more comprehensive investigation may be needed to fully understand the scope of the incident.\n*   The fact that the script tries to clean up its tracks (deleting temporary files) is a strong indication of malicious intent.\n\nTo provide a more targeted response, could you tell me:\n\n*   What is the context of these logs? (e.g., SIEM output, endpoint detection and response tool)\n*   Do you have access to the downloaded script itself (the `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` file)?"}
