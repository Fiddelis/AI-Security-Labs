The use of `win32times` as a task name is also notable. The presence of `whoami.exe` and multiple process accesses of `powershell.exe` further suggests reconnaissance or execution of malicious payloads. Multiple `chrome.exe` registry modifications and file creation events by `winlogbeat.exe` don't directly indicate malicious activity, but warrant further investigation in conjunction with the other findings.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
