{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided logs indicate a sequence of actions likely related to a malicious script execution, specifically involving PowerShell. Here's a breakdown of the observed activity, categorized by concern level:\n\n**High Concern: Potential Malware Execution**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` commands:**  The logs demonstrate repeated use of `powershell.exe`.  Malware frequently uses PowerShell for its flexibility in executing commands, downloading payloads, and evading detection.\n*   **Download and Execution of a ZIP file:** One command `powershell.exe` downloaded `entrada_principal.zip` then executed a command to delete it.  This is a classic sign of downloading a malicious payload and then attempting to clean up traces of it.  The naming convention,  `entrada_principal.zip`, is also somewhat suspicious, suggesting a 'main entry point' type file.\n*  **Image Loading of .NET Assemblies:** The loading of `mscoreei.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`, and `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` by `powershell.exe` is consistent with PowerShell scripts leveraging the .NET framework, which is common in malware.\n\n**Medium Concern: System Modification & Persistence**\n\n*   **`Registry value set` Events:**  Multiple `Registry value set` events logged by `powershell.exe` and `services.exe` are cause for concern.  Malware often modifies registry keys for persistence, to execute automatically on startup, or to alter system behavior.  Without knowing *which* registry keys were modified, the exact impact is unclear, but this warrants investigation.\n*   **`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` creation:** The creation of  `AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file suggests a potential attempt to inject code into PowerShell's startup profile, which could result in automatic execution of malicious scripts on subsequent system starts.\n*   **`services.exe` Registry Modification**: This suggests that a system service is being modified, which could impact system stability or allow for more persistent malicious activity.\n\n**Lower Concern, but Worth Noting**\n\n*   **`whoami.exe`**:  The use of `whoami.exe` suggests reconnaissance - the script is likely attempting to determine the user's identity and permissions.\n*   **`Dism.exe`**: The use of `Dism.exe` might indicate an attempt to manipulate system images, potentially to install malware or modify the operating system.\n*   **File Deletion:**  While the deletion of `entrada_principal.zip` appears to be a clean-up action, it's often used by malware to remove evidence of its presence.\n*   **`svchost.exe` Registry Modification**:  `svchost.exe` is a legitimate system process that hosts Windows services.  Modifying its associated registry keys could have consequences if done maliciously, affecting service behavior and potentially opening doors to further exploitation.\n\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further communication or spread of the malware.\n2.  **Malware Scan:** Run a full system scan with an updated anti-malware solution.  Consider using multiple scanners from different vendors.\n3.  **Analyze PowerShell History:** Examine the PowerShell history files (usually located in `$PSHistoryFile`, which defaults to `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\Windows PowerShell\\PSReadLine_History.txt`) to reconstruct the full sequence of commands executed.\n4.  **Examine Registry Changes:** Use the Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`) to compare the current registry state with a known good backup (if available).  Look for any suspicious or unexpected entries.\n5.  **Review System Startup Items:**  Check the system's startup programs and services (using `msconfig.exe` or the Task Manager) to ensure that no unauthorized items are present.\n6.  **File System Analysis:**  Look for unusual files or directories that may have been created or modified during the infection.\n7.  **Incident Response Plan:** If you have an incident response plan, follow the steps outlined in it.\n8.  **Restore from Backup:** If possible, restore the system from a known-good backup that was created *before* the infection occurred.\n9. **Check other systems:**  Investigate if other systems on the network might be affected."}
