{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided logs indicate suspicious activity involving the creation and startup of a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. Here's a breakdown of the findings and a potential analysis:\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n* **PowerShell Execution:** Multiple entries show PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) being used to create and start a new service. This immediately raises a red flag, as PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often exploited for malicious purposes.\n* **New Service Creation:** The PowerShell command `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"` is crucial.  It does the following:\n    * `New-Service`:  This PowerShell cmdlet creates a new Windows service.\n    * `-Name \"objeto_ativo\"`: The service is named \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese).  This is often a generic name used by attackers to disguise the actual purpose of the service.\n    * `-BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`:  This specifies the executable file that the service will run. This path is very suspicious. Let's analyze it:\n        * `C:\\unidade_logico`:  \"Unidade Logica\" means \"logical drive\" in Portuguese. It’s unusual for programs to be stored directly on the root of a logical drive.  This is a strong indicator of something being deliberately hidden.\n        * `registro_comum`:  \"Common registry\" - This suggests a possible attempt to modify system registry.\n        * `entrada_base`:  \"Base entry\".\n        * `bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`:  `tarefa_logico.exe` – \"Logical task\"\n* **Repeated Execution:** The same PowerShell command is executed multiple times, indicating an attempt to ensure the service is created and running consistently.\n* **Engine Lifecycle:**  A \"Engine Lifecycle\" event is observed along with the service creation, which further confirms that the service is being prepared for execution.\n\n**Potential Threat Analysis:**\n\n* **Malware Persistence:** This is a highly likely scenario. Creating a Windows service is a common technique for malware to achieve persistence – meaning it ensures the malware runs automatically every time the system starts.\n* **Hidden Malware:** `tarefa_logico.exe` is the core concern.  It's almost certainly malware. Its presence on a drive (`C:\\unidade_logico`) is exceptionally suspicious, as is its naming convention.  Further investigation is urgently needed.\n* **Registry Modification:** The path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\" further suggests that the malware might attempt to modify the Windows registry, potentially to alter system behavior or hide its presence.\n* **Information Stealer\/Botnet:**  The service could be designed to steal sensitive information or turn the infected machine into a bot within a larger botnet.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected machine from the network immediately to prevent the malware from spreading or communicating with external servers.\n2. **Malware Scan:**  Run a full system scan with an up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware solution. However, be aware that malware often disables or circumvents security software.\n3. **File Analysis:**  The file `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` *must* be analyzed.  Submit it to a malware analysis service (like VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, or a sandbox environment) to determine its purpose and behavior.\n4. **Registry Examination:** Carefully examine the Windows Registry for any suspicious entries, especially those related to the \"objeto_ativo\" service or the `tarefa_logico.exe` file.\n5. **Process Monitoring:** Implement process monitoring to track any unusual process activity.\n6. **Forensic Investigation:**  Consider a thorough forensic investigation to determine the scope of the infection and how it occurred.\n7. **PowerShell Logging\/Restrictions:**  Review and strengthen PowerShell logging and execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n8. **User Training:**  Educate users about the risks of running suspicious scripts or executables.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Portuguese Language:** The presence of Portuguese terminology indicates that either the attacker is targeting users in a Portuguese-speaking region or is attempting to obfuscate their activities.\n* **Obfuscation:** The attacker is likely using techniques to hide their tracks, so thorough investigation is crucial.\n\n\n\nThis is a serious incident requiring immediate and comprehensive action.  Treat it as a potential active compromise until proven otherwise."}
