The loading of DLLs like amsi.dll, MPOAV.dll and wmiutils.dll is notable.  Several file creation events for Windows event logs are also present, potentially indicating efforts to cover tracks or analyze system behavior. The extensive use of registry value set events across various processes is also unusual. These elements collectively suggest reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
