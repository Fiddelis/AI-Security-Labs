The scripts reference non-existent files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or to test the system's response. The presence of `win32times` as the task name and frequent PowerShell and `schtasks.exe` activity raises suspicion of automated, potentially malicious, processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
