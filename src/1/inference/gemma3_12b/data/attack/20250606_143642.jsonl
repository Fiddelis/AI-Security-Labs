{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data indicates a potential malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and why it's concerning:\n\n**Summary of Events**\n\n1.  **Initial PowerShell Execution:** A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) is started with an encoded command. This is a red flag, as encoded commands often hide malicious intent.\n2.  **File Manipulation:**  The script removes a ZIP file from a temporary folder (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`). This suggests the script might be removing evidence or dependencies.\n3.  **Dynamic PowerShell Script Execution:** A script appears to be dynamically creating and executing a PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`).  This is often a tactic to bypass security measures.\n4.  **Script Policy Bypass:** The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` suggests the script attempted to circumvent PowerShell script execution policies. This is very suspicious.\n5. **DLL loading:** The script loaded several DLL files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll and the Windows Defender DLL. This indicates that the PowerShell script had a dependency on the .NET framework to perform its actions, and is possibly compromising the Windows Defender.\n\n**Specific Indicators of Concern**\n\n*   **Encoded Command:** The presence of a encoded command in the initial PowerShell execution is a primary indicator of malicious intent.\n*   **Temporary Folder Modification:** The removal of a ZIP file from the user's temp folder (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`) is typical of malware trying to erase traces of its activity.\n*   **Dynamic Script Creation:** The creation and execution of a script dynamically points towards an attempt to bypass security policies and detection mechanisms.\n*   **File Deletion:**  The script deleting a file related to a script policy test further supports this assessment.\n*   **DLL loading** The script loading Windows Defender DLL files suggests a potential compromise.\n\n**Possible Malicious Actions**\n\nBased on these indicators, the script could be:\n\n*   **Downloading and Executing Malware:** The script might be downloading and running additional malware components.\n*   **Data Exfiltration:** It could be stealing sensitive data from the system.\n*   **Establishing Persistence:**  The script may attempt to gain persistence on the system, ensuring it runs even after a reboot.\n*   **Lateral Movement:** It could be used to spread to other systems on the network.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further damage or spread.\n2.  **Analyze the Encoded Command:** Attempt to decode the original command to understand the script’s intended actions.\n3.  **Examine the ZIP File:** If possible, recover the ZIP file that was deleted from the temporary folder and analyze its contents.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Check the PowerShell execution policies on the system to identify any anomalies.\n5.  **Scan for Malware:** Run a full system scan with an up-to-date anti-malware solution.\n6.  **Monitor Network Traffic:** Monitor network traffic for any suspicious connections or data transfers.\n7.  **Investigate User Activity:** Examine the user’s activity for any unusual behavior.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A more thorough investigation might be necessary to confirm the presence of malware and to fully understand its impact."}
