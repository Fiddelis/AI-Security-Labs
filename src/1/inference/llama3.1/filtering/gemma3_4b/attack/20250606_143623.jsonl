The log contains a series of JSON objects representing events that have been detected on a Windows system.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the fields in each object:\n\n* `process`: This field contains information about the process that triggered the event.\n\t+ `name`: The name of the process (e.g., \"svchost.exe\").\n\t+ `command_line`: The command line used to launch the process (e.g., a PowerShell script).\n* `winlog`: This field contains information about the Windows event that was detected.\n\t+ `task`: A description of the task or action that triggered the event (e.g., \"Process Create\", \"Registry value set\").\n* `file`: This field is empty for all events, indicating that no file-related activity was detected.\n\nLooking at the content, it appears that there are several instances of PowerShell scripts being executed on the system. The scripts seem to be creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable named \"tarefa_logico.exe\". This could indicate some kind of malware or malicious activity on the system.\n\nSome possible indicators of compromise (IOCs) in this log include:\n\n* The repeated execution of PowerShell scripts with suspicious command lines.\n* The creation of new services with potentially malicious names and binary paths.\n* The use of restricted PowerShell execution policies to execute commands.\n\nA thorough analysis of the system's logs, network traffic, and file systems would be necessary to determine the full extent of any potential compromise."}
