{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log of PowerShell commands being executed on a Windows system. The log contains multiple instances of similar commands, all involving the execution of a PowerShell script named \"WinPwn.ps1\" from a GitHub repository.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what I've observed:\n\n1.  **Command Pattern**: Most of these lines involve running PowerShell using an executable (e.g., `powershell.exe`), followed by a string that is executed as PowerShell code. This pattern suggests that the script is being run in a way that bypasses normal PowerShell execution, likely through a mechanism like an & operator (`&`) which allows for executing strings of PowerShell commands.\n2.  **Script Download and Execution**: The script seems to download from GitHub using `iex` (Invoke-Expression) on a `new-object net.webclient`. This approach suggests that the goal is to execute code in memory without saving it locally, which could be a part of a payload or exploit mechanism.\n\nSome notable aspects include:\n\n*   **Command-Line Argument Bypass**: The command-line argument bypass (`powershell.exe & {...}`) allows the execution of arbitrary PowerShell commands. This technique can help in executing scripts or payloads when normal invocation might be blocked by security measures.\n*   **Execution of External Scripts**: Running an external script, such as `WinPwn.ps1`, from a remote location like GitHub suggests that this is part of a larger payload delivery mechanism.\n\nThis could potentially be used for:\n\n*   Executing arbitrary commands or payloads\n*   Bypassing certain security measures in PowerShell (like execution policy)\n*   Delivering malware or exploiting vulnerabilities\n\nGiven the context, it's likely that these logs are associated with malicious activity."}
