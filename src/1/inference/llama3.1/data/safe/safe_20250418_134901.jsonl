{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"This log appears to be from the Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) tool, which collects and forwards Windows event logs to a central location. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n**General Structure**\n\nEach event is represented by an object with three main keys: `process`, `winlog`, and `file`. These objects contain information about the process that triggered the event, the Windows event itself, and any related file activity.\n\n**`process` Object**\n\nThis object contains information about the process that triggered the event. It typically includes:\n\n* `name`: The name of the process.\n* (Optional) Other fields like `executable_path`, `pid`, or `parent_pid`.\n\n**`winlog` Object**\n\nThis object contains information about the Windows event itself. It usually has a single key: `task`. This key indicates the type of event that occurred, such as:\n\n* `File created`: A file was created.\n* `Registry value set`: A registry value was modified.\n* `Image loaded`: An executable or DLL was loaded into memory.\n* `Dns query`: The system made a DNS query.\n\n**`file` Object**\n\nThis object contains information about any related file activity. It typically includes:\n\n* `path`: The full path to the file that was created, accessed, or modified.\n\nSome notable events from this log include:\n\n* A Chrome.exe process performing multiple registry value set events.\n* Notepad.exe and Calculator.exe accessing files in the Windows System directory.\n* Svchost.exe modifying registry values several times.\n* Setup.exe creating a temporary file in the Windows SystemTemp directory.\n* Smartscreen.exe loading an executable from the System32 directory.\n\nThis log appears to be collecting information about various system processes, including browsers (Chrome), system services (svchost, smartscreen), and user-created files (setup.exe). It may be used for monitoring system activity, troubleshooting, or security analysis."}
