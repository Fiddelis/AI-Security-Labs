{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided events, I would classify the batch as **INTERESTING**.\n\nHere's my justification:\n\nThe batch contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. \n\nFirstly, there are multiple instances of PowerShell being used to download files from GitHub repositories. This could be indicative of a malicious actor attempting to exfiltrate data or inject malware into the system.\n\nSecondly, the presence of `powershell.exe` processes with command lines containing `(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile()` suggests an attempt to execute a PowerShell script that downloads a file from a remote location. This is a common technique used by malware and other malicious actors to download payloads or exfiltrate data.\n\nThirdly, the repeated instances of `Registry value set` events for `chrome.exe` processes are unusual and may indicate an attempt to modify system registry values, potentially as part of a lateral movement or privilege escalation attack.\n\nLastly, the creation of new files in various locations, such as the Downloads folder and PowerShell startup directories, could be indicative of malicious activity.\n\nConsidering these findings, I would classify this batch as **INTERESTING**, indicating that further investigation is warranted to determine the root cause of these activities.\n\nHere's the result in the required format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious PowerShell usage, repeated Registry value set events for chrome.exe, and creation of new files in various locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
