{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This is a JSON log file that contains information about Windows events, processes, and files. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n**Format**\n\nThe log file consists of multiple JSON objects, each representing an event or process. The format of each object is:\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {...},\n  \"winlog\": {...},\n  \"file\": {...}\n}\n```\nWhere:\n\n* `process`: An object containing information about the process that triggered the event.\n* `winlog`: An object containing information about the Windows event that occurred.\n* `file`: An object containing information about any files involved in the event.\n\n**Process Object**\n\nThe `process` object contains the following fields:\n\n* `name`: The name of the process (e.g., \"services.exe\", \"sppsvc.exe\").\n* `command_line`: The command-line arguments used to start the process (if applicable).\n\n**Winlog Object**\n\nThe `winlog` object contains the following fields:\n\n* `task`: A string describing the Windows event that occurred (e.g., \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\", \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\").\n* Other fields may be present depending on the specific event.\n\n**File Object**\n\nThe `file` object contains the following field:\n\n* `path`: The path to the file involved in the event (if applicable).\n\n**Example Entries**\n\nHere are a few example entries from the log file:\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\"name\": \"services.exe\"},\n  \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\n  \"file\": null\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\"name\": \"sppsvc.exe\", \"command_line\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll\"},\n  \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"},\n  \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll\"}\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": null,\n  \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Windows Update Agent\"},\n  \"file\": null\n}\n```\nThese examples illustrate the structure of the log file and the types of data it contains."}
