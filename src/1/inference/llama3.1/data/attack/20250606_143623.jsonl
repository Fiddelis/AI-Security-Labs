{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"A nice JSON log!\n\nAfter analyzing the logs, I've extracted some interesting information:\n\n**Anomalous activity:**\n\n* In several events (e.g., #7-#12), a PowerShell command is executed to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This might be a sign of malicious activity, as it creates a new service that can potentially run arbitrary code.\n* In event #5, the `taskschd.dll` file is loaded by the `sppsvc.exe` process. While this is a legitimate system file, its loading by an unknown process raises some suspicions.\n\n**Common themes:**\n\n* The \"objeto_ativo\" service is created and started repeatedly in several events.\n* Many of the events are related to registry value changes or image loads, which can be indicative of malicious activity.\n* PowerShell is frequently used as a command-line interface for executing scripts.\n\n**Potential indicators of compromise (IOCs):**\n\n* The presence of the \"objeto_ativo\" service and its repeated creation and start\n* The loading of `taskschd.dll` by an unknown process (`sppsvc.exe`)\n* The use of PowerShell to execute suspicious commands\n\nTo further investigate these events, I would recommend:\n\n1. Reviewing system logs for any additional information about the \"objeto_ativo\" service.\n2. Investigating the processes running on the system around the time of the suspicious events.\n3. Checking for any network activity related to the execution of PowerShell scripts or other suspicious commands.\n\nPlease note that these findings are based solely on the provided JSON log, and further analysis may be necessary to confirm the presence of malicious activity."}
