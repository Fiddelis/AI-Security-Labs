{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a summarized timeline of events based on the provided logs:\n\n1. **Initial System Activity:**\n   - `services.exe` creates and modifies registry values.\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loads `taskschd.dll`.\n   - `svchost.exe` sets registry values (likely due to scheduled tasks).\n\n2. **Potentially Malicious Activity:**\n   - An unknown process (possibly related to a scheduled task) executes PowerShell commands repeatedly (`powershell.exe`). The command being executed is:\n     ```\n     New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\n     Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n     ```\n   This script creates a new Windows service named `objeto_ativo` with the binary path set to a suspicious-looking file (`tarefa_logico.exe`) located in an unusually named directory structure (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`). It then starts the newly created service.\n\n3. **Subsequent Activity:**\n   - The same PowerShell commands are executed repeatedly by the unknown process, with the `Engine Lifecycle` event appearing at the end of this series.\n   - No other significant events are logged during this time frame.\n\nThis activity suggests that an unknown process may be attempting to create and start a Windows service using a potentially malicious binary file. To further investigate:\n\n- Check if there's any legitimate reason for creating and starting a service named `objeto_ativo`.\n- Inspect the file `tarefa_logico.exe` and its containing directory structure, if accessible.\n- Monitor further system activities related to this event."}
