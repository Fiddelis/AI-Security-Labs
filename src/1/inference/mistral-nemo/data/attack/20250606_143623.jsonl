To investigate further:\n\n- Check if `tarefa_logico.exe` is a legitimate or malicious file.\n- Monitor the activities of the \"objeto_ativo\" service to see if it behaves unexpectedly.\n- Look for other related files or processes in the same path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`) and examine their behavior."}
