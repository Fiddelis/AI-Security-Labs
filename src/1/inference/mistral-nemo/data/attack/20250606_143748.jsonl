The `sensitivefiles` argument implies that the script is looking for sensitive files.\n- **User Account Management** (6 occurrences, but with no process details): These events occurred after each Provider Lifecycle event, suggesting that user account management tasks were triggered by the execution of the PowerShell script.\n\nGiven the context, it's likely that these events indicate a security threat, such as a persistent script or malware executing and potentially exfiltrating sensitive data. It would be wise to investigate this further and take appropriate action, such as containing the threat and remediating any compromised systems."}
