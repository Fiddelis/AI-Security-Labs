This could indicate an error in your build or deployment process that's causing the files to be recreated unnecessarily.\n\n   - *Solution*: Check your build or deployment scripts to ensure they're not inadvertently re-creating these files. You might want to add a check to see if the file already exists before attempting to create it again.\n\n2. **File Creation Timestamps**: The timestamps on these logs are all within a short period of time, suggesting that all these file creations happened almost simultaneously. This could indicate a bulk operation gone wrong.\n\n   - *Solution*: If you're performing bulk operations, ensure that they're properly handled to avoid overwhelming the system and causing unintended errors or duplicates.\n\n3. **File Path**: The files are being created in the `OfflineFiles` folder under `PackageResources\\SolutionPackages`.
