The files created (`*.archive`, `*.js`, `world*_pack` directories, etc.) are all related to game assets, advertisements configuration, and game packages, which align with typical behavior of a gaming application.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nThese events represent routine activities of Microsoft Solitaire Collection and pose no apparent threat. Therefore, they should be classified as **Normal\/Expected** behavior.\n\n**Classification Summary:**\n- **Event Type:** File creation\n- **Process Involved:** Solitaire.exe**\n- **Files Created:** Game-related files (`*.archive`, `*.js`, `world*_pack` directories)\n- **Behavior Classification:** Normal\/Expected"}

The events are primarily of two types: 'File created' and 'Dns query'.\n\n1. **File creation events (90% of data):** All these events occurred within the same directory structure (`C:\\Users\\feddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\cache\\dlfiles\\globaldata`). The files created are archives with names following a pattern suggestive of resource packs (e.g., `.archive`). These events appear mundane and likely related to normal game operations like downloading or updating game assets.\n\n   - *Interesting:* 0.7 (Frequent, expected behavior for a game client)\n   - *Suspicious:* 0.3 (Lack of variety in file paths and names could potentially indicate some form of scripting or automation)\n\n2. **Dns query event (10% of data):** This single event stands out due to its difference from the majority. Dns queries can sometimes indicate suspicious activities, but without additional context, it's hard to pinpoint any malicious intent here.\n\n   - *Interesting:* 0.3 (Could be normal game functionality like updating leaderboards or checking for new content)\n   - *Suspicious:* 0.5 (Single instance of a Dns query among many file creation events could potentially warrant further investigation)\n   - *Malicious:* 0 (No apparent malicious indicators at this time)\n\nGiven the lack of contextual information and the single, albeit notable, deviation from expected behavior, the dataset's overall risk classification remains:\n\n- **Interesting:** 0.2\n- **Suspicious:** 0.5\n- **Malicious:** 0"}
