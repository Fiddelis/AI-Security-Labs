This script was almost immediately deleted.\n- The process then created a pipe, suggesting it might be communicating with another process.\n- Finally, it created another file in the PowerShell startup directory.\n\nWithout more context or the actual command line arguments used to create `powershell.exe`, it's difficult to determine exactly what happened. However, these events suggest that some kind of script or command was run using PowerShell, which led to the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary file, followed by IPC via pipe creation and another file creation event.\n\nTo investigate further, you might want to look into:\n\n- The source of the `powershell.exe` process (i.e., what script or command triggered it).\n- The content of the created files (if possible), especially the one in the PowerShell startup directory (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`).\n- Whether any other processes were communicating with this `powershell.exe` instance via pipes."}
