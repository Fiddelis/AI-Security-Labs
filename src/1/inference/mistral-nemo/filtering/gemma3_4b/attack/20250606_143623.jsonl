The script also starts this newly created service.\n   - This indicates that the PowerShell script is creating and starting a new Windows service, which could allow it to run persistently even after system restarts.\n\n5. **Final result: 1**\n   - Two events log the execution of a PowerShell command with output \"Final result: 1\". This suggests that some operation within the script completed successfully.\n\nGiven these logs, it appears that a malicious PowerShell script (possibly containing malware) was executed, which then created and started a new Windows service to ensure persistence. It also modified registry values and possibly installed software or made system configuration changes. These activities could indicate an attempted compromise of the system.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Investigate the `tarefa_logico.exe` file and its origin.\n- Remove the newly created \"objeto_ativo\" service if it's not legitimate.\n- Scan the system for any malicious files or software installed by this script.\n- Review system logs for further signs of compromise or suspicious activities."}
