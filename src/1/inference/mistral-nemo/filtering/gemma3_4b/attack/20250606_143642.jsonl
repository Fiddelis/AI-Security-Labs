The PowerShell process performed various tasks, including cleanup of the original zip file and a generated script, loaded several DLLs, and manipulated registry values and files. Further investigation is needed to determine the full extent of the malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Disable macros in Office applications to prevent similar attacks.\n- Keep systems and software up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n- Regularly backup important data.\n- Implement a robust antivirus\/antimalware solution and keep it updated.\n- Monitor user behavior and system activities for any suspicious or unusual activity."}
