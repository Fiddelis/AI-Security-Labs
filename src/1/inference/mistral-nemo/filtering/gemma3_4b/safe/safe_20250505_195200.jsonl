The files are being created by the same process (\"SDXHelper.exe\"), and they all follow a consistent naming pattern, suggesting that they're part of a structured update or generation process.\n\n**Potential Threat Assessment:**\n\nWhile these events might seem innocuous at first glance (as they're related to a legitimate product like Microsoft Office), it's crucial to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Unusual Frequency:** The repetition of the \"File created\" event suggests that there might be an unusual or unwanted process running in the background.\n\n2. **Offline Files Generation:** The files are being generated offline, which could indicate that they're not part of the standard Microsoft Office update process and thus might pose a risk.\n\n3. **Consistent Naming Pattern:** While consistent naming patterns aren't necessarily malicious, they can sometimes indicate the presence of malware, such as ransomware or cryptojacking software.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **In-depth Investigation:** Further investigation is needed to determine if these files are part of a legitimate update process or if they pose a threat.\n\n2. **File Analysis:** Analyze the content and behavior of the generated JavaScript files to ensure they're safe and do not contain malicious code.\n\n3. **Microsoft Office Verification:** Verify with Microsoft that these events and files are indeed associated with a legitimate update or feature related to their AI copilot in Office.\n\n4. **Endpoint Protection:** If found to be malicious, apply appropriate endpoint protection measures such as isolating the affected system, removing the offending files, and running a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus software.\n\n5. **User Education:** Educate users about the risks associated with unrecognized file generation processes and how to identify potential threats."}

Check with Microsoft's official documentation to verify if this behavior is expected.\n2. Monitor these files for any changes or unusual activities.\n3. If possible, test the functionality of your system by disabling the creation of these files temporarily (while ensuring no critical features are affected).\n4. Regularly update your Microsoft Office applications to ensure you have the latest security patches.\n5. Implement a robust antivirus and endpoint detection and response solution to protect against any potential threats."}
