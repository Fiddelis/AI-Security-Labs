{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided log file, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the events:\n\n1. **Initial PowerShell Execution**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process is created and accesses another process (likely Explorer.exe).\n   - It then accesses the registry.\n\n2. **Zip File Deletion**\n   - Another `powershell.exe` process is created with a command line indicating it's removing a file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the Temp folder.\n\n3. **Potential Suspicious Activity**\n   - A `Dism.exe` (Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool) process is created, which then deletes a file named `WimProvider.dll` located in the user's temp directory.\n\n4. **PowerShell Loading DLLs**\n   - The same `powershell.exe` process loads several DLL files:\n     - `mscoree.dll`\n     - `clr.dll` (Common Language Runtime)\n     - `mscoreei.dll`\n\n5. **Pipe Creation and Profile Data Creation**\n   - A pipe is created by the `powershell.exe` process.\n   - It then creates a file named `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` in the PowerShell directory.\n\n6. **Final Output**\n   - After some internal events related to the PowerShell engine lifecycle, the final output is written: \"Final result: 1\".\n\nHere are some observations:\n\n- The initial zip file deletion could indicate an attempt to remove evidence of the initial payload.\n- The use of `Dism.exe` and the deleted `WimProvider.dll` file could suggest an attempt to modify or install a malicious component, although this is not definitive without more context.\n- The final output \"Final result: 1\" might imply that some action was completed successfully.\n\nTo better understand the full context and potential threat, you would need to analyze additional information such as:\n\n- The content of `entrada_principal.zip` (if available).\n- Further activity related to `Dism.exe`.\n- Other suspicious events happening around this time.\n- Any relevant network traffic."}
