{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the events:\n\n1. **Process Creation:**\n   - A new process was created with `name`: `powershell.exe`. This process is running a command line that creates a new service named `objeto_ativo` and starts it.\n\n2. **Registry Event:**\n   - A registry value was set, but no further details are provided about what exactly happened during this event.\n\n3. **Winlog Events (Provider Lifecycle):**\n   - There are several events with the task `'Provider Lifecycle'`. These events seem to be related to the initial setup or startup of certain components or providers.\n   - The process mentioned is `powershell.exe` running a command line that creates and starts a service named `objeto_ativo`.\n\n4. **Winlog Event (Engine Lifecycle):**\n   - There's one event with the task `'Engine Lifecycle'`. This could indicate some sort of engine startup or shutdown activity.\n\n5. **Process Execution:**\n   - A new process was created with `command_line`: `\"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\"`. This suggests that PowerShell is running with restricted execution policy and displaying the message `'Final result: 1'`.\n\nHere are some potential concerns or observations:\n\n- The repeated `'Provider Lifecycle'` events could indicate an attempt to create a persistent service for malicious purposes.\n- The creation of a new service named `objeto_ativo` and starting it might be indicative of a possible malware infection or unauthorized software installation.\n- Running PowerShell with the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag suggests that the script is being run in a way that restricts its execution, which could be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nTo investigate further, you should consider reviewing the processes and services running on the system, checking for any unusual or unknown files in the directories mentioned (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`), and examining the system's registry for any suspicious entries. It might also be helpful to review recent network activity to see if there are any connections being made that could indicate communication with a command and control server.\n\nAdditionally, running a malware scan or using other security tools could help identify any malicious software on the system."}
