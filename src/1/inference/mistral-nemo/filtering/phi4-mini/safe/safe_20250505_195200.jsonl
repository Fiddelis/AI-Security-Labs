Here's a summary:\n\n- **Process Name:** `SDXHelper.exe` - This is likely a process associated with Microsoft Office.\n- **Task:** `File created (rule: FileCreate)` - The task performed by this process is creating new files.\n- **File Details:**\n  - These are JavaScript files (.js) containing strings for Excel copilot features.\n  - The filenames are UUIDs, indicating they might be unique instances or versions of these files.\n  - They are located in a directory under the user's local Microsoft Office installation (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`).\n  - Each file contains strings for different Excel copilot features (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_<UUID>.js`).\n\n**Interesting Note:** The filenames and their UUIDs suggest that these files might be generated dynamically each time the process runs.\n\n**Potential Security Concern:** While this isn't inherently malicious, the generation of numerous JavaScript files could potentially be a sign of unwanted behavior or even malware if other indicators are present (like unusual CPU usage, network activity, etc.).

Check if there are any recent changes, updates, or installations in Microsoft Office that might be causing this behavior.\n3. If deemed necessary based on further investigation, consider adjusting the scheduling of the task (if applicable) to avoid potential performance issues during peak usage hours.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nFurther analysis should involve reviewing logs and process history for the SDXHelper.exe process, as well as checking for any recent Office-related changes or installations.

The process named `SDXHelper.exe` triggered a Windows event with the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".\n2. This event was logged multiple times (40 instances) between two timestamps.\n3. The file being created is a JavaScript bundle minified (`officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) which seems to be related to Office products and their assistant, Copilot.\n4. The files are created in the same directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n5.
