Since both events happened simultaneously, it suggests that `SDXHelper.exe` is dependent on or using `combase.dll`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the logs in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"process\": {\"name\": \"SDXHelper.exe\"},\n    \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\n    \"file\": null,\n    \"timestamp\": \"2022-09-15T08:46:27Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"process\": {\"name\": \"SDXHelper.exe\"},\n    \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"},\n    \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\combase.dll\"},\n    \"timestamp\": \"2022-09-15T08:46:27Z\"\n  }\n]\n```"}
