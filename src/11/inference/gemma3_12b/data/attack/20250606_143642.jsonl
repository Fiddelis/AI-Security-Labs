{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This is a fascinating and concerning log set. It describes a PowerShell-driven attack sequence, designed to disable security measures and likely deploy malicious code. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, broken down by phases and including severity assessments.  I will also provide recommendations on how to respond.\n\n**Overall Assessment: HIGH Severity** - This sequence demonstrates a determined attacker using multiple techniques to evade detection and potentially compromise the system.\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Execution and Registry Manipulation (Low-Medium Severity)**\n\n*   **`services.exe` Registry Value Set:** This is often an early sign of an attacker attempting to subtly change system configurations. It's difficult to know the *exact* impact without more details, but it's a potential red flag.\n*   **`sppsvc.exe` & `svchost.exe`:**  Standard Windows processes.  Their presence isn't inherently malicious in this context.\n\n**Phase 2: PowerShell Obfuscation & Initial Actions (Medium-High Severity)**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` Process Create & Access:** This marks the start of the core malicious activity. The attacker is leveraging PowerShell to execute commands.\n*   **`whoami.exe`:**  A standard utility, likely used for reconnaissance - to determine the user's context, privileges, and current environment.\n*   **`powershell.exe` & `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:** This command is **very concerning**.  It's using PowerShell to delete a ZIP file from the user's temporary directory. The file name \"entrada\\_principal.zip\" suggests this was likely a payload or a part of the initial attack package. The `-Force` parameter prevents confirmation prompts, indicating a deliberate attempt to be stealthy.  *This is a clear indicator of malicious intent.*\n*   The use of `$env:Temp` is standard for attackers to place temporary files.\n\n**Phase 3: PowerShell Execution and Script Policy Bypass (High-Critical Severity)**\n\n*   The use of `powershell.exe` to delete a zip file named `entrada_principal.zip`  suggests the attacker is trying to clean up their tracks.  This strongly implies the ZIP file contained a malicious payload.\n*   The script policy test `powershell.exe` shows an attempt to bypass PowerShell execution restrictions.  This is a crucial step for attackers to run their malicious scripts.\n*   The attacker is bypassing security policies to allow scripts to run.\n\n**Phase 4: DLL Loading (High-Critical Severity)**\n\n*   The numerous PowerShell `Image loaded` events loading DLLs like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` indicate the attacker is leveraging the .NET framework and PowerShell's automation capabilities.  This suggests the malicious script is likely complex and using .NET functionality.\n*   Loading of `mscoreei.dll` and `clr.dll` proves the attacker is using the .NET runtime for malicious purposes.\n*   The loading of `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` shows the attacker is actively using PowerShell's automation features.\n*   Loading of `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender related) could indicate an attempt to interact with or manipulate Defender, or to potentially disable or evade detection.\n\n**Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n*   **File Name:** `entrada_principal.zip` -  This is a crucial name to flag.\n*   **Temporary Directory Activity:**  Any unusual activity in `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`.  Focus on file creation, deletion, and modification times.\n*   **PowerShell Execution:**  Pay close attention to PowerShell command lines, especially those involving `Invoke-Expression`, `Invoke-Command`, and obfuscated commands.\n*   **DLL Loading:**  Monitor PowerShell process DLL loading to identify suspicious modules.\n\n**Recommendations for Response (Immediate Actions)**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.\n2.  **Forensic Imaging:** Create a forensic image of the system's hard drive *before* making any changes. This is essential for investigation and potential recovery.\n3.  **Antivirus\/EDR Scan:**  Run a full scan with updated antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.  However, be aware that the attacker may have already disabled or evaded these defenses.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:**  Examine the system's PowerShell execution policy to ensure it's set to a restrictive level.\n5.  **Investigate User Account:**  Investigate the user account (`fiddelis`) that this activity is associated with. Look for any unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or other suspicious activity.\n6.  **Review Windows Defender Configuration:** Check the state of Windows Defender. Look for any signs of tampering or disabling.\n7.  **Examine Scheduled Tasks:** Review scheduled tasks for any newly created or modified tasks that could be related to the attack.\n8.  **Log Analysis:**  Thoroughly analyze system logs (Windows Event Logs, PowerShell logs, etc.) for any other indicators of compromise.\n9.  **Password Reset:**  Reset the password of the user account (`fiddelis`) and any other accounts that may have been accessed by the attacker.\n10. **Patching:** Ensure the system is fully patched with the latest security updates.\n\n\n\n**Long-Term Mitigation**\n\n*   **Implement Application Whitelisting:**  Restrict the execution of programs to only those explicitly authorized.\n*   **Strengthen PowerShell Security:**  Enforce strict PowerShell execution policies, use constrained language mode, and monitor PowerShell activity.\n*   **Improve User Training:**  Educate users about phishing and other social engineering tactics.\n*   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication:**  Enable MFA for all user accounts.\n*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is a complex situation, and it's essential to involve experienced security professionals to assist with the investigation and remediation efforts. The data provided indicates a sophisticated attack, and a thorough and comprehensive response is crucial."}
