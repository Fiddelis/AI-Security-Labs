{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The log data indicates suspicious activity revolving around the creation and startup of a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. Here's a breakdown of the observations and potential concerns:\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **PowerShell Service Creation:** The core of the activity is a PowerShell command executed via `powershell.exe`. This command attempts to create and start a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n    *   `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`: This part creates the service, specifying `tarefa_logico.exe` as its executable.\n    *   `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`:  This command immediately attempts to start the newly created service.\n\n*   **Suspicious Binary Path:**  The `BinaryPathName` points to `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This location is unusual and suggests a custom program or script that's not part of standard Windows components.  The specific folders (\"unidade_logico\", \"registro_comum\", \"entrada_base\") are particularly noteworthy and look like potentially obscured names.\n*   **Repetitive Execution:** The PowerShell command is executed multiple times, as evidenced by the repeated entries in the log.  This suggests a loop or automated process is repeatedly attempting to create and start the service.\n*   **Lifecycle Events:**  The log records \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events related to the service, which are expected phases in a service’s operational stages, but highlight the ongoing and repeated service initiation attempts.\n*   **File Deletion:** An earlier event involving the deletion of a file (`C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll`) indicates a potential attempt to disable or remove legitimate Windows functionality. This is a *very* concerning sign.\n*   **Registry Modifications:** Numerous `Registry value set` events suggest changes are being made to the Windows Registry, possibly related to the new service or other system configurations. These are difficult to assess without knowing the specific values being modified, but should be investigated.\n\n**Potential Threats & Concerns:**\n\n*   **Malware\/Trojan:** The suspicious binary path and attempts to create a hidden service strongly indicate a potential malware infection.  The file being executed, `tarefa_logico.exe`, is likely malicious code designed to perform actions without the user’s knowledge or consent.\n*   **Persistence Mechanism:** The creation of a Windows service provides a method for malware to persist on the system even after reboots.  Services automatically start when the system starts, ensuring the malware's continued operation.\n*   **Information Theft:** The malware could be designed to steal sensitive information (passwords, financial data, personal files) from the compromised system.\n*   **Remote Control:** The service could be used as a backdoor, allowing attackers to remotely control the infected system.\n*   **System Compromise:** The deletion of `taskschd.dll` suggests that an attacker is actively trying to disable\/manipulate system functionality.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of potential malware.\n2.  **Antivirus Scan:** Run a full system scan with a reputable antivirus program. Make sure your antivirus definitions are up to date.\n3.  **Malware Analysis:** If possible, submit `tarefa_logico.exe` to a malware analysis service (e.g., VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis) to determine its exact purpose and behavior.\n4.  **System Restore:** If you have a recent system restore point, consider restoring your system to that point.\n5.  **Forensic Investigation:** Engage a cybersecurity professional or incident response team to perform a thorough forensic investigation of the system.\n6.  **Review PowerShell Logs:** Examine other PowerShell logs for other suspicious commands that might have been executed.\n7.  **Monitor Registry Changes:** Implement registry monitoring tools to track changes to the Windows Registry.\n8.  **Review Startup Items:** Manually review startup programs and services to identify any suspicious entries.  Pay close attention to anything unusual or unknown.\n9.  **Rebuild System (Extreme Case):** If the infection is severe and difficult to remove, consider rebuilding the system from scratch.\n\n**Crucially, investigate the folder structure** \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\". Its origin and the files within are key to understanding the scope of the compromise. This looks like a deliberately obfuscated or customized location."}
