This behavior is indicative of potential reconnaissance or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the presence of screen capture functionality using `System.Windows.Forms` combined with file creation for startup profiles raises concerns about information theft or establishing a persistent backdoor. While several benign events (Calculator, Chrome, winlogbeat) are present, the overall pattern warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
