The repeated activity of `chrome.exe` with registry modifications and DLL loads warrants further investigation. The presence of `winlogbeat.exe` creating files is also a notable event, although less concerning on its own. The combination of events suggests a potential for malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
