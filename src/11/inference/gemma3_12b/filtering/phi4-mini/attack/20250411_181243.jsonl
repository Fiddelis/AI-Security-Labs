The presence of `net1.exe` which isn't a standard Windows binary, along with various PowerShell and command-line tools used for system enumeration and potential credential dumping (cmdkey \/list), combined with the `powershell.exe` creating a file and registry modifications, strongly suggests reconnaissance and possible malicious activity.
