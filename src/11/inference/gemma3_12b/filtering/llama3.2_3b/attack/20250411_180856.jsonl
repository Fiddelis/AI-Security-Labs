The repeated use of `WMIC.exe` loading Defender components alongside other potentially suspicious process activity suggests possible reconnaissance or a script attempting to evade detection by manipulating Defender's internal components. Furthermore, the `powershell.exe` process access events warrant closer inspection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
