{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log shows a PowerShell script execution with several stages. Let's break down what's happening:\n\n**Initial Setup & Cleanup**\n\n*   **`whoami.exe`**:  Standard command to see which user is logged in.\n*   **`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`**: A PowerShell command that attempts to delete a ZIP file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory. The `-Force` parameter suppresses confirmation prompts. This is likely cleanup after a previous script execution, suggesting it's part of an automated process.\n\n**Main Script Execution (PowerShell)**\n\n*   **`Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`**: Indicates the script has successfully completed and likely returns a status code of 1.\n*   **PowerShell Activities:**  The script's execution involves a variety of actions:\n    *   **Image Loading (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll)**:  The PowerShell process is loading several .NET framework DLLs.  This means the script is using .NET functionality, which is very common.\n    *   **File Deletion (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`)**: This file was likely a temporary file created during the script's execution, and it is being deleted afterwards. This suggests the use of a technique to bypass Execution Policy restrictions.\n    *   **Registry Modification**: A registry value is being set.  This could change system settings or program behavior.\n    *   **Microsoft Defender DLL Load:** Loads a Microsoft Defender DLL.\n    *   **Startup Profile Creation:** Creates a `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file. This file could be used to configure the PowerShell environment or modify scripts that run automatically.\n\n**Bypassing Execution Policy**\n\n*   The use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` in the final command along with the deletion of the `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` suggests an attempt to bypass PowerShell's execution policy. The script deletes a file, likely a test script that temporarily modifies the execution policy. This technique can be used to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked.\n\n**Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n*   **Bypassing PowerShell Execution Policy:** This is a red flag. It indicates the script is trying to run even if it's not trusted.\n*   **File Deletion:**  Deleting temporary files, especially in conjunction with Execution Policy bypass, is often used to cover tracks.\n*   **Registry Modification:**  Changing the registry can have wide-ranging impacts, making this action potentially dangerous.\n*   **Startup Profile Creation**:  Creating a non-interactive startup profile could mean the script will execute automatically on future system startups without user intervention.\n*   **Cleanup Routine:**  Deleting the zip file suggests an effort to remove traces of the script's presence.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe log strongly indicates a PowerShell script execution with attempts to bypass security restrictions and modify system behavior. The presence of cleanup routines and execution policy bypass are significant indicators of potentially malicious activity. Further investigation is needed to understand the script's full purpose and impact."}
