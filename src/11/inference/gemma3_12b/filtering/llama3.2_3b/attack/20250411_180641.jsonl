The frequent use of temporary directories and unusual executable names ('estrutura_ativo.exe', 'modulo_secundario.exe') strongly suggests potential malicious activity like code execution or malware installation.  The creation of a new winlogbeat configuration file also warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
