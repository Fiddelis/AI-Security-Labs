{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"The log entries you provided are from Windows Event Logs, specifically filtered and formatted for use with Winlogbeat. They represent various system and application events categorized by tasks. Here's a breakdown of the information contained within these logs:\n\n1. **Process Events:**\n   - `Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)`: Indicates that a DLL or executable file was loaded into memory. Examples include:\n     - `svchost.exe` loading `taskschd.dll`.\n     - `notepad.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`.\n   \n2. **File Events:**\n   - `File created (rule: FileCreate)`: This shows the creation of a new file.\n     - Multiple entries for creating `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in different directories, related to Winlogbeat configuration files.\n\n3. **Registry Events:**\n   - `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)` and `Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)`: These events log modifications to the Windows registry.\n     - Examples include changes made by processes like `svchost.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and others.\n\n4. **DNS Queries:**\n   - `Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)`: Logs DNS queries initiated by a process, such as `chrome.exe`.\n\n5. **User Account Management:**\n   - An unspecified user account management event is logged without any associated process details.\n\n6. **System and Application Tasks:**\n   - The logs include tasks from various system services (e.g., `sppsvc.exe` related to Windows Activation Service) and applications (e.g., `Calculator.exe`, `chrome.exe`, etc.).\n\nThe log entries are structured in JSON format, making them suitable for ingestion into systems like Elasticsearch or other SIEM solutions. Each entry includes details about the process involved, the task or rule that triggered it, and any file paths if applicable.\n\nOverall, these logs provide a detailed view of system activity related to processes, files, registry changes, DNS queries, and more. This information is crucial for security monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes."}
