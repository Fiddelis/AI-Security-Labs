{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potentially malicious behavior: repeated PowerShell execution with ImageLoad and FileCreate\/Delete operations, alongside SSH network connections and registry modifications by Explorer.EXE.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Activity**: The batch shows numerous PowerShell process activities including `Process Create`, `Image Load`, `File Create`, and `Provider Lifecycle` tasks, which can be indicators of script execution or automation. These actions are common in both benign administrative scripts and malicious operations.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion by PowerShell**: There is an event where a file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) is created and then deleted by the `powershell.exe` process, which might indicate dynamic script execution or attempts to evade detection.\n\n3. **SSH Activity**: The presence of SSH network connections suggests external access points that could be exploited for remote command execution or data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Registry Modification by Explorer.EXE**: Although less suspicious in itself, when combined with other events, it can hint at potential post-exploitation activity such as persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\n5. **Frequency of Operations**: The frequency and combination of these operations within a short time frame indicate behavior that deviates from normal administrative or user activities on the system, thus warranting further investigation.\n\nThe overall context suggests a scenario that is consistent with typical patterns observed in various types of cyber threats, particularly those involving lateral movement, persistence, or data manipulation. Hence, this batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" for closer examination. The confidence level reflects a high likelihood based on the combination of events analyzed."}
