{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell execution, along with process and file access events that could indicate potential suspicious behavior such as script execution or unauthorized configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **PowerShell Execution**: The log repeatedly shows the use of `powershell.exe`, a common tool that can be used legitimately but also for malicious purposes, especially when combined with other indicators.\n  \n- **Pipe Creation and Access**: A pipe event (`Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)`) and access to PowerShell (`Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)`) might suggest inter-process communication, which could be benign or part of a command-and-control mechanism.\n\n- **File Activities**: The creation of files by `winlogbeat.exe` might indicate an attempt to modify logging configurations. Although `winlogbeat` is typically used for log aggregation, its use in creating new configuration files can be suspicious if not documented or expected.\n\n- **System File Loading**: Observing system files like `MpClient.dll` and `urlmon.dll` being loaded could suggest legitimate operations, but when seen with other indicators (like PowerShell usage), it might warrant further investigation to rule out exploitation attempts.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests a pattern that is often associated with reconnaissance or malicious activities, justifying the classification as \"INTERESTING\" for further analysis. The confidence level reflects the potential risk based on typical patterns but acknowledges the need for more context to confirm malicious intent definitively."}
