Additionally, the presence of an unusual process `updater.exe`, with a specific command line containing parameters for crash handling and external URLs, raises suspicion about potential malicious activity. While these behaviors may occur in legitimate contexts, their combination across several logs warrants further investigation to rule out malicious intent. The confidence level reflects the need for additional context or confirmation through deeper analysis."}
