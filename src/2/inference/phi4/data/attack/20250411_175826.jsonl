{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events of Chrome (`chrome.exe`) performing registry operations, which could indicate tampering or persistence activities. Additionally, there are file creation events by `powershell.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`, which might suggest potential misuse for script execution or log manipulation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Chrome's Registry Activities**: The repeated registry value setting by `chrome.exe` is unusual as it could indicate attempts at altering configurations for persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**: PowerShell executing a file creation operation might suggest script-based automation potentially used for malicious purposes such as downloading and executing additional payloads.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity**: The activity of `winlogbeat.exe` creating a new configuration file could be benign (e.g., an update or installation process), but in combination with other events, it raises suspicion due to potential log tampering or monitoring evasion attempts.\n\nThe combination of these activities across different processes within the batch suggests a pattern that warrants further investigation. The confidence level is set high but not absolute, as some activities could be legitimate depending on context and user permissions."}
