The first event involves svchost.exe, a common host process for Windows services, writing to a file within the Delivery Optimization State directory, which may be unusual or indicative of tampering if not part of regular system updates. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file is normal, but its context in this batch raises questions about why it was modified together with other processes.
