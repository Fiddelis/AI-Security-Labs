This level of activity with PowerShell, especially when combined with suspicious command lines, can indicate scripting for malicious purposes.\n\n2. **Command Execution via Cmd.exe**: There are entries showing `cmd.exe` executing commands to delete files in the temp directory. The deletion of files such as `tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe` is particularly noteworthy because it suggests an attempt to clean up after some operation, which could be malicious.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple instances where registry values are set by different processes (including cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe) suggest attempts to alter system configurations or hide presence, common tactics used by malware to maintain persistence or evade detection.\n\n4. **File Deletions Logged**: The deletion of specific files is logged (`FileDeleteDetected`), indicating potential unauthorized access or cleanup operations that are characteristic of malicious activity trying to remove traces.\n\n5. **Use of Legitimate Processes for Unusual Tasks**: Processes like `whoami.exe`, typically used for user identification, and legitimate system utilities being used in atypical ways (e.g., with unusual command lines) indicate possible exploitation or misuse.\n\n6. **Frequency and Pattern**: The frequency and pattern of these activities, especially those involving PowerShell scripting and file deletions, suggest coordination that could be indicative of an attack rather than random benign behavior.\n\nGiven the combination of these factors, the batch presents a strong case for further investigation into potential malicious activity. Confidence is high due to clear indicators of suspicious behavior across multiple logs."}
