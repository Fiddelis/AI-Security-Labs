{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe may indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activity, combined with access and creation events involving powershell.exe and whoami.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Repeated Registry Modifications**: The batch shows multiple instances of `chrome.exe` performing registry value set operations (`RegistryEvent`). This repeated action could be an indicator of persistence attempts or malicious behavior to modify system settings.\n\n- **PowerShell Access**: There are events showing `powershell.exe` being accessed. PowerShell is a common tool used in both legitimate administration and malicious activities for executing scripts, potentially indicating suspicious activity depending on the context (e.g., unauthorized access).\n\n- **Whoami Execution**: The presence of `whoami.exe` with a process creation event might suggest attempts to gather information about the system environment or user privileges, which can be part of reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\nCombining these factors suggests a pattern that warrants further investigation, hence the classification as \"INTERESTING\"."}
