The use of 'powershell.exe' for setting registry values, creating files, and accessing processes repeatedly suggests potential unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, WMIC loading various system libraries could indicate enumeration attempts, while the presence of 'cmd.exe' with commands to create new processes is noteworthy.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
