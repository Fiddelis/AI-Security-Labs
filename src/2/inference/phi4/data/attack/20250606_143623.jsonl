Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key components and their significance:\n\n1. **Processes**:\n   - The logs mention several processes such as `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and instances where commands are run using `powershell.exe`.\n   - The PowerShell command line is particularly significant because it indicates a script execution to create and start a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n2. **Winlog Tasks**:\n   - These entries describe the type of event or activity detected, categorized by tasks like \"Process Create\", \"Registry value set\", \"Image loaded\", and more.\n   - The repetitive use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" in conjunction with PowerShell scripts suggests these events are related to software components being installed or executed.\n\n3. **Files**:\n   - The logs mention specific files such as `taskschd.dll`, which is a Windows Task Scheduler dynamic-link library, indicating system tasks or scheduling activities.\n   - The file paths provided (e.g., `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`) are crucial for identifying potential malicious software execution.\n\n4. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - The repeated creation of a service named \"objeto_ativo\" could be indicative of malware activity, as this is a common tactic used by attackers to ensure persistence on an infected system.\n   - The use of PowerShell for executing scripts that create services can raise red flags if not part of legitimate software operations.\n\n5. **Analysis Suggestions**:\n   - Investigate the `tarefa_logico.exe` file to determine its legitimacy and potential threats.\n   - Review any changes or new entries in the Windows Services list related to \"objeto_ativo\".\n   - Examine recent modifications in the registry, especially those set by `svchost.exe`, as they could be indicative of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Next Steps**:\n   - Conduct a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware tools.\n   - Consider using a network security solution to monitor for unusual outbound connections that might suggest data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.\n   - Review logs in Event Viewer to gather more context around the timing and source of these activities.\n\nThese steps can help determine if any unauthorized actions are occurring on the system and guide further remediation efforts."}
