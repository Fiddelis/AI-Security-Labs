{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple use of PowerShell for compressing files to TEMP directory and file deletion suggest potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **PowerShell Usage**: \n   - There are several instances where `powershell.exe` is used with the `Compress-Archive` cmdlet, targeting various directories for compression into ZIP files in the TEMP directory. The frequent use of PowerShell scripts to compress data and move it elsewhere can be indicative of attempts to exfiltrate or prepare data for malicious purposes.\n   \n2. **File Deletion Event**:\n   - A file deletion event is recorded (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1`), which could indicate an attempt to clean up traces after executing a script, often seen in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware.\n\n3. **Other Indicators**:\n   - The use of `winlogbeat.exe` and registry modification via `conhost.exe` is typical of legitimate operations but, combined with the other suspicious PowerShell activities, heightens the concern.\n   \n4. **Combination of Events**:\n   - Taken together, these events suggest a pattern of behavior that could be associated with malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or preparation for further exploitation.\n\nGiven these observations and typical patterns of malware behavior, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation, with a high confidence level due to multiple concerning indicators."}
