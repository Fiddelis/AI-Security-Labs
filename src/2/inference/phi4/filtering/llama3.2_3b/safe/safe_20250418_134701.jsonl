It's commonly used in legitimate software development workflows.\n\n2. **File Paths and Content**: \n   - All the file paths point to directories typically associated with project dependencies (`node_modules`) and TypeScript definition files (`.d.ts`). This suggests that these are part of normal development operations.\n   \n3. **Task Consistency**: The task reported by each event is \"File created,\" which aligns with what you would expect when generating or updating type definitions in a JavaScript\/TypeScript project.\n\n4. **Project Context**: The folder path includes `\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"`, indicating it may be part of an educational or professional software quality course, making the activity more plausible as legitimate work rather than malicious intent.\n\n5. **Lack of Suspicious Activity**:\n   - There are no signs of unusual processes (e.g., `cmd.exe` for script execution), unexpected system changes, or anomalous file types that could indicate a compromise.\n   - The files created do not include executables or scripts typically associated with malware delivery mechanisms.\n\nGiven the above points, there is high confidence that this batch represents normal development activity and does not warrant further investigation from a cybersecurity perspective."}
