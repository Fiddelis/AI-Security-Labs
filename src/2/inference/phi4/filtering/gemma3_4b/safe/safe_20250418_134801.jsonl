This indicates an educational or development environment rather than malicious intent.\n\n3. **Type of Files**: Created files include source code (like `index.js`), metadata (`package.json`), documentation (`README.md`, `LICENSE`), and configuration files (`.eslintrc`, `.nycrc`). These are typical components of npm packages, suggesting normal package management activities.\n\n4. **Rule Triggered**: The event rule \"FileCreate\" is a standard audit trail entry for file creation, not inherently suspicious without additional context such as unusual or unexpected locations and filenames.\n\n5. **Pattern Consistency**: There is no irregular pattern or anomaly in the files created (e.g., random file types, large volume of non-standard files) that would suggest malicious activity.\n\nGiven these points, the events align with regular operations related to managing Node.js packages, which are commonplace in software development environments. Therefore, there's high confidence that this batch is not indicative of malicious behavior and does not require further investigation."}
