{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repeated loading of common DLLs by SDXHelper.exe, a suspicious process name, and unusual use of rundll32.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is repeatedly loading critical system DLLs like `urlmon.dll` and `combase.dll`. This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in these libraries, as they are often targeted by attackers.\n- The use of **rundll32.exe** with a custom CLSID (`{9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6}`) is unusual and could indicate malicious intent. Custom CLSIDs may be associated with malware attempting to execute arbitrary code.\n- While other events like those involving **EXCEL.EXE** and **winlogbeat.exe** are benign, the suspicious activity related to `SDXHelper.exe` and `rundll32.exe` raises enough concern to warrant further investigation. The combination of these elements suggests potential malicious behavior that should not be ignored."}
