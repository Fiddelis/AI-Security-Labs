While SDXHelper is typically used in Office solutions for updates, it can also be exploited by malware.\n\n2. **Patterns in File Creation**: \n   - Multiple files with similar naming patterns (`excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_*`) were created.\n   - Duplicate file names within the same folder indicate potential automation or scripting, which could be a red flag for malicious activity.\n\n3. **File Path and Consistency**:\n   - All files are being created in the same directory under `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, which is expected but still requires scrutiny due to the volume and pattern.\n   - The presence of GUIDs suggests these might be part of a legitimate package, yet their rapid creation raises suspicion.\n\n4. **Volume of Events**: \n   - A high number of file creations in quick succession by the same process can indicate a scripted activity, which could potentially be malicious if not part of an expected update or installation routine.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**:\n   - The confidence is set at 0.85 due to the strong indicators of automated behavior and potential misuse of `SDXHelper.exe`, balanced against the possibility that this might be a benign, albeit unusual, legitimate operation."}
