SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs without context is also unusual.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Discord-related Activity**: \n   - The batch shows repeated logs for `Discord.exe` with tasks like `Network connection detected`, `Process accessed`, and `Pipe Created`. These are potentially suspicious as they may indicate exploitation or unauthorized communication attempts.\n   \n2. **SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Multiple entries of `Image loaded` rules involving core system DLLs (`combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) with `SDXHelper.exe` could be indicative of potential misuse, especially if this executable is not recognized as part of normal operations.\n\n3. **MpCmdRun.exe and MpClient.dll**:\n   - These are associated with Windows Defender operations. While generally benign when executed by `MpCmdRun.exe`, their repeated logs do suggest significant system activity that's expected but could mask other anomalies.\n\n4. **General Context**:\n   - The presence of normal application activities (like OneDriveLauncher and Winlogbeat) alongside these suspicious entries suggests the need for closer inspection to ensure no malicious behavior is occurring or being obscured by legitimate processes.\n   \n5. **Confidence Level**: \n   - While these observations are concerning, they are based on patterns that could be benign in certain contexts (e.g., heavy use of Discord or specific application behaviors). Hence, the confidence level reflects this balance between suspicion and potential normalcy."}
