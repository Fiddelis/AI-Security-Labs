{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The log entries you've provided seem to be from a Windows system, capturing various activities related to process creation and registry modifications. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Process Creation**:\n   - There are multiple instances where \"whoami.exe\" and \"powershell.exe\" processes are created.\n   - The `whoami.exe` is typically used for displaying user information, such as the currently logged-in user.\n\n2. **Powershell Activity**:\n   - Several actions involving `powershell.exe` are logged, including process creation, accessing registry values, loading images (DLL files), and file operations.\n   - One specific command line shows PowerShell being used to remove a zip file from the temp directory.\n\n3. **Registry Event**:\n   - A PowerShell process sets a registry value, which could potentially be part of an operation to configure or modify system settings.\n\n4. **File Operations**:\n   - Creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script in the temporary folder: `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.\n\n5. **Image Load Events**:\n   - Various DLLs are loaded by PowerShell, including those related to .NET Framework (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and security-related components (like `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender).\n\n6. **Pipe Event**:\n   - A pipe creation event is logged with no additional context provided in these logs.\n\nOverall, the logs indicate routine operations involving PowerShell, which can be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and potentially malicious activities. The deletion of a file named \"entrada_principal.zip\" could suggest an attempt to clean up after executing or preparing some files. Monitoring such activities for unusual patterns is essential for maintaining system security. If these actions are unexpected or unauthorized, they might warrant further investigation."}
