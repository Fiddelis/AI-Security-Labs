This suggests potential tampering or injection of scripts, possibly indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n``` \n\nIn this analysis, several key observations contribute to the classification:\n\n1. **Redundancy and Hash Similarity**: The batch includes multiple entries where files with identical names (differing only by their hash in filenames) are created repeatedly. This pattern is unusual for benign operations, as legitimate applications typically avoid redundant file creation unless necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Script Injection**: The fact that the affected files are JavaScripts stored within a directory associated with Microsoft Office suggests an attempt to inject or manipulate scripts in this trusted environment. Such behavior could be aimed at achieving persistence or executing arbitrary code via trusted applications.\n\n3. **Process Name (SDXHelper.exe)**: While SDXHelper.exe is typically used by Windows for handling Click-to-Run installations, its involvement here with file creation events outside of the expected installation tasks raises suspicion. It might suggest that the process is being abused to execute unexpected actions.\n\n4. **Consistency and Frequency**: The repetition and frequency of these events imply an automated or scripted activity rather than isolated manual operations, which could be a sign of malware leveraging administrative processes for malicious purposes.\n\nGiven these factors, there's a significant level of suspicion regarding potential malicious behavior warranting further investigation, hence the classification as \"INTERESTING\" with a high degree of confidence."}
