Key indicators of interest include the loading of critical system DLLs by PowerShell (mscoree.dll, clrjit.dll), the creation of a file with an unusual name pattern (__PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1) that may be used for obfuscation or bypassing execution policies, and the pipe event which could indicate inter-process communication potentially for command and control. These events together suggest possible malicious behavior worth further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
