The use of certutil.exe to encode and decode a system file (calc.exe) into temporary files indicates potential obfuscation or malware activity. Additionally, the execution of rundll32.exe with a DLL not commonly associated with typical Windows operations could be part of an exploit attempt. SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll twice is unusual for legitimate processes and suggests possible interference with system libraries. Network connections made by chrome.exe combined with multiple registry modifications also raise suspicion about unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
