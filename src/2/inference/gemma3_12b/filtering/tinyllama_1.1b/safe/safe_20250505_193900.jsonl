The multiple `svchost.exe` processes with unusual command lines (`NgcCtnrSvc`, `NgcSvc`) are also noteworthy.  The `updater.exe` process execution with a command line containing a URL and attachment path, alongside pipe creation events, raises suspicion. Finally, the creation of a winlogbeat config file during winlogbeat execution also stands out. These combined events warrant investigation for potential malicious activity, especially considering the repeated nature of the Chrome-related activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
