The presence of file creation events related to `winlogbeat.exe` and a file download (`tarefa_geral.txt`) also raises suspicion. While individual events may seem benign, their combination suggests potential reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or malicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
