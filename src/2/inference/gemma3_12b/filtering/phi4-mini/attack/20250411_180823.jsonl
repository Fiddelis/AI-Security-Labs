While `calc.exe` itself is benign, the creation of scheduled tasks, especially those running with elevated privileges, is a common tactic used by attackers to establish persistence. The unusual names of the tasks (e.g., \\\"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\\\") and the repeated use of `cmd.exe` for task execution are also suspicious. The numerous registry events across various processes, including `svchost.exe`, also warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
