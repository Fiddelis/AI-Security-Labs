The repeated calls to `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` looking for files ending in '.key' warrants further investigation.  The Chrome process activity, including AMSI DLL loading, could indicate evasion techniques. The winlogbeat installation activity is also noted, though less concerning on its own.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
