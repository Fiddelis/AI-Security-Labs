This combination of activities, especially the temporary script creation and the potentially suspicious DLLs loaded by PowerShell, suggests possible malicious activity, possibly involving post-exploitation or reconnaissance. Multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events for PowerShell further corroborate this. While other events involving normal processes are present, the PowerShell events are concerning enough to warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
