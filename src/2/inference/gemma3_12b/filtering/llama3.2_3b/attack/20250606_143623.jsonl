{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the events logged, along with a summary of the observed activity.  Please read the caveats at the end as well - these types of logs can be tricky!\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThe activity recorded involves the attempted creation and startup of a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo.\"  The executable for this service is `tarefa_logico.exe`, located in `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\`.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Events**\n\n1. **Initial XML Data (likely the initial detection from an EDR or similar system)**\n   * **`process`: `None`**: This indicates that the initial alert didn't identify a specific process involved at the very beginning.  This is common in some alerts which are designed to indicate potential service or scheduled task changes.\n   * **`winlog`: `{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}`**: This winlog entry is confusing when paired with `process: None`. It suggests an attempt to create a process, but doesn't identify *what* process.  The `ProcessCreate` rule likely triggered based on other indicators (e.g., registry change, file creation) related to the future service.\n   * **`file`: `None`**:  The alert didn't explicitly associate a file at this initial stage.\n\n2. **PowerShell Service Creation**\n   * **`process`: `{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}'}`**: This is the key event.  It shows a `powershell.exe` process executing a command to:\n     *  Create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo.\"\n     *  Set the `BinaryPathName` (the executable to run) to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n     *  Immediately start the newly created service.\n   * **`winlog`: `{'task': 'Provider Lifecycle'}`**: This winlog entry confirms that the service creation and startup process occurred.\n   * **`file`: `None`**: No file associated with this event.\n\n**Interpretation and Potential Concerns**\n\n* **Service Creation via PowerShell:** Creating services via PowerShell is less common than using the standard `sc.exe` tool or graphical interfaces. This is often a tactic used to obfuscate service creation, making it harder to detect and analyze.\n* **Unusual File Path:** The file path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is suspicious.  It's unlikely to be a standard Windows system file. The names (\"unidade_logico,\" \"registro_comum,\" \"entrada_base\") sound like a localized or custom directory structure, increasing the likelihood that it’s malicious or unauthorized.\n* **\"tarefa_logico.exe\":**  The name of the executable itself doesn't provide clear indicators of legitimacy. Further investigation into what `tarefa_logico.exe` *does* is critical.\n* **Potential Malware\/Unauthorized Activity:**  Given the combination of the unusual service creation method and the suspect file path and executable name, this activity should be treated as a high-priority security concern. It’s highly probable that it represents malicious or unauthorized activity.\n* **Service Name Obfuscation**:  The service name \"objeto_ativo\" could be an attempt to blend in with legitimate Windows services to avoid detection.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. **Immediate Containment:** If possible, isolate the affected system from the network.\n2. **Malware Scan:** Perform a full system malware scan using updated anti-virus and anti-malware tools.\n3. **File Analysis:**  Analyze `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` using tools like:\n   *   VirusTotal (online malware scanning)\n   *   PEview (for examining the executable's structure)\n   *   Reverse engineering (advanced, if expertise is available)\n4. **Process Tree Inspection:** Examine the process tree for this PowerShell instance to see what other processes or actions are associated.\n5. **Registry Analysis:**  Check the Windows Registry for the newly created service's configuration details. The service configuration will be located under `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\objeto_ativo`.\n6. **Event Log Review:** Review the Windows Event Logs (especially System and Application logs) around the time of the event for related errors or warnings.\n7. **Security Assessment:** Conduct a broader security assessment to identify any other potentially compromised systems or accounts.\n8. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) investigation:**  If you have an EDR solution, use it to investigate the full scope of the activity.\n\n**Caveats**\n\n* **False Positives:** While the activity looks suspicious, it's *possible* it's a legitimate (though unusual) configuration change. Thorough investigation is crucial.\n* **Log Fragmentation:** This is a snapshot of events.  There may be preceding or subsequent events not captured in this log that provide more context.  Try to trace the activity further back.\n* **Log Manipulation:**  Attackers can sometimes manipulate logs to conceal their actions. Don't rely solely on these logs to make decisions.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide definitive security advice. This analysis is based on the information provided and should be supplemented with expert human assessment and investigation.*"}
