{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log shows a suspicious PowerShell script execution. Let's break down the key points and potential implications:\n\n**Summary of Actions:**\n\n1.  **Initial Execution & Deception:** A PowerShell script is initially executed, seemingly testing script policy (indicated by `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`). This is a tactic to circumvent restrictions and potentially execute malicious code later.\n2.  **File Deletion:**  A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) is deleted. This is likely to cover tracks after the initial testing phase.\n3.  **PowerShell Startup Modification:** The PowerShell startup profile for a non-interactive user is modified. This is a *highly concerning* action. Modifying startup profiles means the malicious code will execute automatically whenever a user (even non-interactive services) logs in or the system starts.\n4.  **Image Loading & DLL Usage:** The script extensively loads various DLLs, including `mscoree.dll` (Microsoft .NET runtime), `clr.dll`, and `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`. This suggests the script uses the .NET framework for its operations.\n5. **Windows Defender DLL loading:** The `MpClient.dll` indicates the script might be attempting to interact with or evade Windows Defender, although this could be coincidental.\n6. **Final Result:** The last line confirms the script completed with a \"Final result: 1\", which is likely a status code for the attacker.\n\n**Detailed Analysis & Concerns:**\n\n*   **PowerShell Script Policy Bypass:** The script started by attempting to bypass PowerShell's execution policy, which is a common technique to bypass security restrictions.\n*   **Persistence Mechanism:** The modification of the non-interactive PowerShell startup profile (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is a significant indicator of persistence. This means the attacker has established a way to re-execute the malicious code at a later time, even if the initial process is terminated or the system is rebooted.  This is a classic persistence technique.\n*   **.NET Framework Usage:** The script's reliance on .NET framework libraries is typical for PowerShell scripts that perform complex operations or require access to system resources.\n*   **Potential Evasion:** The loading of Windows Defender DLLs could be an attempt to evade detection or perform actions related to the security product.  This doesn't necessarily *prove* it's malicious, but warrants investigation.\n\n**Recommendations for Investigation:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Startup Profile:**  Immediately examine the contents of `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`.  This file contains the malicious code and must be removed or neutralized.\n2.  **Scan System:** Perform a full system scan using updated antivirus and anti-malware software.\n3.  **Check PowerShell History:** Examine the PowerShell history logs to determine the full sequence of commands executed.\n4.  **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor network traffic for suspicious outbound connections.\n5.  **Review Process Tree:** Analyze process trees to identify any unusual parent-child relationships.\n6.  **User Activity Review:** Review the user accountâ€™s activity for any unusual actions.\n7. **Isolate the system:** If possible, isolate the system from the network to prevent further propagation of the malware.\n8. **Restore from backup:** Consider restoring the system from a known-good backup.\n\n**Severity:** *Critical*\n\nThis script exhibits hallmarks of a malicious attack.  The persistence mechanism (modifying the non-interactive PowerShell startup profile) is extremely dangerous, and immediate action is required to contain and eradicate the threat.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A comprehensive investigation may require additional information and forensic analysis."}
