Further, the use of `sc.exe` to start the Windows Update service (`wuauserv`) suggests an attempt to trigger update processes, which might be malicious.  Multiple registry events and process accesses across various programs (powershell, chrome, cmd) also warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
