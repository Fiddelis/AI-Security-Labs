{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this PowerShell activity.  This looks like a malicious script execution attempting to evade detection and potentially install something. Here's a detailed analysis, focusing on the suspicious elements and what they likely indicate:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nThe script uses PowerShell to download a zip file, extract it, and then likely executes code within it. It also attempts to clean up after itself by deleting the temporary zip file.  The activity appears to be designed to bypass PowerShell execution policy checks.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Events:**\n\n1. **`Process Create (Process Create)` - `whoami.exe`:**  This is a common tactic. It's often used by attackers to determine what user account is running the script, and to gather information about the environment.  It's not inherently malicious, but in this context, it's part of reconnaissance.\n\n2. **`Process Accessed` & `Process Create` - `powershell.exe`:** A PowerShell process is initiated and accessed.\n\n3. **`Registry Value Set` - `powershell.exe`:**  This is likely setting a registry key to modify PowerShell execution policy. This is a critical step to allow the script to run unsigned or potentially dangerous code.  The specific key being modified is a significant indicator of intent.\n\n4. **`Process Create` - `powershell.exe` (with complex command):**  This is the *key* malicious event.\n    *   `powershell.exe`: Invokes a new PowerShell instance.\n    *   `& { ... }`:  This runs a script block in the new PowerShell instance. The `&` operator executes the block immediately.\n    *   `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`: This line attempts to delete a zip file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory. This is a crucial cleanup step to remove traces of the downloaded file.  The `-Force` parameter suppresses confirmation prompts.\n    *   *This command strongly suggests a downloaded zip file was unpacked and executed, and the attacker is trying to remove evidence of that download.*\n\n5. **`Image loaded` events for `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`, etc.:** These indicate that the PowerShell script is heavily utilizing the .NET Framework. This isn't inherently malicious, but attackers frequently leverage .NET for various functionalities within their scripts.\n\n6. **`File created` & `File Delete logged` - `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:** This series of events is very suspicious.\n    *  A temporary PowerShell script is created and immediately deleted.  The naming convention suggests a test or workaround involving PowerShell script execution policy. This indicates an attempt to test whether a script can be executed or to circumvent the restrictions.\n\n**Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n*   **Circumventing PowerShell Execution Policy:** The modification of PowerShell execution policy is a classic sign of malicious intent.\n*   **Downloaded and Executed Zip File:** The `entrada_principal.zip` deletion strongly points to a downloaded archive containing a payload.\n*   **Cleanup Operations:**  Deleting temporary files (`entrada_principal.zip`, the temporary PowerShell script) is a common tactic to cover tracks.\n*   **Temporary Script Creation\/Deletion:** The test script is a strong indicator of attempting to circumvent security controls and\/or obfuscating the payload.\n*  **Use of `$env:Temp`:**  The use of the user's temporary directory is often used to temporarily store data.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Investigate the downloaded Zip File:**  If possible, attempt to retrieve the `entrada_principal.zip` file from network traffic captures or backup systems. Analyzing its contents would reveal the exact nature of the payload.  *Do this in a secure, isolated environment (sandbox).*\n*   **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:**  Examine the PowerShell execution policy settings and identify if they were modified.\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Investigation:**  An EDR solution should provide more detailed information about the PowerShell process, including the complete script content, network connections, and any modifications made to the system.\n*   **Network Traffic Analysis:**  Analyze network traffic to identify the source of the downloaded zip file and any subsequent network connections made by the PowerShell process.\n*   **User Education:**  Educate users about the risks of running PowerShell scripts from untrusted sources and the importance of verifying the contents of downloaded files.\n*   **Harden PowerShell Environment:** Restrict PowerShell execution policy, implement code signing requirements, and monitor PowerShell activity.\n\n\n\n**To help me provide a more precise analysis, could you tell me:**\n\n*   What is the source of these logs? (e.g., SIEM, EDR, Windows Event Logs)\n*   Is there any further information about the command that was run to execute PowerShell? (The entire command string is important)\n*   Do you have access to the full contents of the PowerShell script?"}
