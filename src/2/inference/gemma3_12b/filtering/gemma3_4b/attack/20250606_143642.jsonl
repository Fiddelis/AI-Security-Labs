{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The analysis of the provided logs reveals a sequence of actions likely related to a malicious script execution. Here's a breakdown of the events and their potential significance:\n\n**Initial Execution & Download:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` process with encoded command-line:** This is the initial point of entry.  The encoded command-line suggests the attacker is trying to obfuscate their actions to evade detection. The `services.exe` and `Registry value set` actions right after suggest a possible attempt to establish a foothold or manipulate system settings.\n*   **`sppsvc.exe` with `taskschd.dll` image load:** This likely means a scheduled task is being leveraged or modified. `sppsvc.exe` is the service responsible for managing packaged applications (like those from the Microsoft Store). `taskschd.dll` is used by Task Scheduler.  A malicious actor could create a scheduled task to run malicious code later.\n\n**File Operations and Cleanup:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` commands for file deletion:**  The attacker used PowerShell to delete a file called `entrada_principal.zip`. This suggests that `entrada_principal.zip` may have contained components that were initially downloaded, but were removed after use to obscure the attacker's activity.\n*   **Creation and immediate deletion of a test script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`):** This technique is often used by attackers to bypass PowerShell execution policy restrictions. By briefly creating a script, then attempting to run it, they can attempt to change the policy in a way that allows their main script to run.\n*   **Image loads:**  The series of `Image loaded` events show what .NET libraries and other components PowerShell is using during this execution. This is standard behavior for PowerShell scripts that use .NET functionality.\n\n**Key Observations and Indicators of Compromise:**\n\n*   **Obfuscated PowerShell Command:** The initial command-line being encoded is a significant red flag. Attackers often do this to hide their intentions.\n*   **Scheduled Task Manipulation:** The connection to the Task Scheduler suggests persistent malware or actions designed to re-establish access.\n*   **PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass:**  The test script creation and deletion is a clear attempt to circumvent PowerShell's security features.\n*   **File Deletion to Conceal Activity:**  Removing downloaded files (`entrada_principal.zip`) shows a desire to cover tracks.\n* **Use of System Resources:** .NET image loads, suggesting the use of Windows resources for malicious purposes.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Review Scheduled Tasks:**  Examine all scheduled tasks in Task Scheduler for unusual entries or modifications.\n2.  **Investigate PowerShell History:**  Check the PowerShell history for the encoded command used to initiate the process.\n3.  **Malware Scan:** Run a thorough malware scan using up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware tools.\n4.  **System Isolation:** If possible, isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further damage or spread of the malware.\n5. **Examine File System:** Thoroughly scan file system, particularly temp directories for signs of malicious files.\n6. **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:** Consider tightening PowerShell execution policy to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided logs. A more comprehensive investigation might be required to fully understand the scope and impact of the compromise."}
