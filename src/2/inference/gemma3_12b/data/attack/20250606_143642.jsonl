{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events describes a malicious PowerShell script execution that attempts to delete files and likely bypasses security measures. Let's break down what's happening:\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Execution and Setup**\n\n1. **`taskschd.dll` and Registry Modification:** `taskschd.dll` being loaded and registry changes suggest a scheduled task or something being initialized. This is likely the delivery mechanism for the malicious script.  The attacker is setting the stage.\n2. **`sppsvc.exe` & Image Loading:** `sppsvc.exe` is related to Supplemental Package Service.  Its image loading could be part of a more complex initialization process, potentially manipulating system processes.\n3. **`services.exe` & Registry Changes:**  Another system service is involved, likely with registry modifications, further suggesting the attacker is gaining control and making changes to the system configuration.\n\n**Phase 2: Malicious PowerShell Script Execution**\n\n4. **PowerShell Execution & `whoami.exe`:**  The attacker starts `powershell.exe`.  Running `whoami.exe` likely indicates reconnaissance – the attacker is trying to determine their current user privileges.\n5. **File Deletion Command:**  A critical line: `powershell.exe` executes a command to delete all files in a temporary directory: `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`.  This strongly suggests the initial payload (likely an archive containing further malicious components) was downloaded and is now being eradicated to cover tracks.  The `-Force` parameter ensures deletion even if files are read-only or hidden.\n6. **Multiple `.dll` Image Loads:**  The subsequent `.dll` loads (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, etc.) are characteristic of PowerShell script execution, especially those involving .NET objects.  This indicates the PowerShell script is complex and utilizing .NET functionality.  Loading of `MpOAV.dll` is concerning, as it suggests interaction with Windows Defender, which could be an attempt to disable or evade detection.\n\n**Phase 3: Cleanup and Further Concealment**\n\n7. **Temporary File Creation & Deletion:** The creation of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` in the temporary folder, followed by its immediate deletion, is a clear attempt to avoid detection.  The naming convention suggests PowerShell script policy tests are being run (likely to bypass restrictions). The script likely contained commands related to this bypass.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise & Summary**\n\n* **Scheduled Task Abuse:**  The use of `taskschd.dll` points to the exploitation of a scheduled task for initial execution.  This is a common delivery method for malware.\n* **File Deletion:** The aggressive deletion of `entrada_principal.zip` and the temporary PowerShell script are strong indicators of malicious intent – covering tracks and removing evidence.\n* **.NET Usage:** Heavy reliance on .NET libraries (.dll files) is typical of advanced malware.\n* **Windows Defender Interaction:** Loading of `MpOAV.dll` suggests attempts to disable or bypass Windows Defender.\n* **PowerShell Policy Bypassing:** Creation and deletion of a PowerShell script indicates an attempt to circumvent PowerShell execution policies.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* **Investigate Scheduled Tasks:** Thoroughly examine all scheduled tasks for suspicious entries.\n* **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Ensure PowerShell execution policies are properly configured to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n* **Monitor File Activity:**  Implement monitoring for unusual file creation and deletion, especially in temporary directories.\n* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Deploy an EDR solution to provide advanced threat detection and response capabilities.\n* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic for communication with known malicious IP addresses or domains.\n* **Memory Forensics:** Perform memory forensics to identify any persistent malware components that may have been loaded into memory.\n\n\n\nThis sequence of events paints a picture of a well-planned and potentially sophisticated attack. Prompt and thorough investigation is critical."}
