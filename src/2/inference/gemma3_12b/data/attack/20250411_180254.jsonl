Although seemingly innocuous commands are being run, the frequency and combination suggest potential reconnaissance or automated activity. The systeminfo and reg query commands, especially the repeated query of the Disk Enum key, are common tactics used in initial assessment. The creation of event logs by svchost is unusual. Furthermore, multiple processes access PowerShell and CMD, potentially masking actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
