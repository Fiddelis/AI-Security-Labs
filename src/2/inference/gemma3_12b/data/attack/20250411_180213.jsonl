Specifically, the repeated network connections from chrome.exe, coupled with the execution of powershell.exe and cmd.exe, suggests possible reconnaissance and lateral movement. The cmd.exe command line includes actions that manipulate the System32 directory, specifically replacing `sethc.exe` with `cmd.exe`, which is a known privilege escalation technique. The file creation of `sethc_backup.exe` further supports this. While some events appear benign (e.g., notepad.exe, calc.exe), the overall pattern warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
