The creation of files within a user's download folder and registry modifications by cmd.exe also raise concerns, suggesting potential malicious activity. While winlogbeat.exe file creation is present, it's likely related to a deployment and less concerning in isolation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
