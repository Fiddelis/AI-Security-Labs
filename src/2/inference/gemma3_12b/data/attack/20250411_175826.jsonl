This behavior, combined with the repeated pattern and timing manipulations (setting dates to 01\/01\/1970), is indicative of potential malicious activity, likely aimed at concealing file modification times or preparing files for a later stage of an attack.  The use of PowerShell, repeated file modification, and specifically manipulating LastWriteTime are strong indicators of tampering. The presence of a startup profile creation by powershell and winlogbeat data gathering further increases the concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
