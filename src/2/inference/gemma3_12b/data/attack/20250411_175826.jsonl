This behavior is highly suspicious and strongly indicative of potential file tampering or manipulation, possibly for covering tracks. The repeated nature of the activity and the consistent timestamp used further raise concerns. The presence of calc.exe, Calculator.exe, and winlogbeat.exe activity and svchost.exe registry modifications indicate normal system operations, but the PowerShell activity overshadows these and warrants further investigation.
