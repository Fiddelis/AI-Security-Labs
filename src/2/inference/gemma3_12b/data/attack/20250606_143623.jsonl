{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided logs show a series of events, with a suspicious pattern emerging around the creation and startup of a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo.\"  Let's break down the key observations and potential implications.\n\n**1. Initial Anomaly:  `sppsvc.exe` Loading `taskschd.dll`**\n\n*   `sppsvc.exe` is the Windows Software Protection Service. While it does use DLLs, seeing it load `taskschd.dll` (Task Scheduler) is slightly unusual on its own. It *could* be part of a legitimate, though perhaps less common, Windows update or a specific application.  Further investigation of this specific event would be worthwhile, but not immediately alarming without corroborating information.\n\n**2.  The Suspicious Pattern: Repeated PowerShell Service Creation**\n\n*   The most concerning part is the repeated execution of the same PowerShell command:\n\n    ```powershell\n    powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\n    Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n    ```\n\n    Let's break this down:\n\n    *   `New-Service`:  This PowerShell cmdlet creates a new Windows service.  The service is given the name \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese).\n    *   `-BinaryPathName`: This is crucial. It specifies the executable that will run as the service.  It points to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  **This is where the danger lies.** `unidade_logico` translates to logical drive. This path suggests a deliberately crafted location outside the standard Windows program files directories.\n    *   `Start-Service`: This cmdlet immediately starts the newly created service.\n\n*   **Repeated Execution:** This command is executed multiple times in rapid succession.  This suggests an automated process or script is repeatedly attempting to create and start the service.  This is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\n**3. Key Concerns & Potential Implications:**\n\n*   **Malware\/Persistence Mechanism:** The repeated service creation is highly indicative of an attempt to establish persistence. Malware often creates services that automatically start when the system boots, ensuring it remains active even after reboots.\n*   **Unknown Executable:** The file `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is the biggest red flag. Its existence and use as a service binary is unusual. It requires immediate analysis.  It's likely a malicious executable disguised as a legitimate system process.\n*   **Unusual Path:** The path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin` is also unusual. Malware often drops files into locations outside of the normal application installation directories to evade detection.  This is a common tactic.\n*   **Portuguese Language:** The service name and the path elements suggest the attacker may be targeting a Portuguese-speaking user or environment. This doesn't inherently mean the attack is targeted, but it's a detail to note.\n\n**Recommendations & Remediation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Isolation:**  Disconnect the affected machine from the network immediately to prevent further communication and potential spread.\n2.  **File Analysis:**  The most critical step is to analyze `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  Submit it to a reputable online malware scanning service (VirusTotal) and perform a thorough static and dynamic analysis.  Look for signs of obfuscation, unusual API calls, or signs of malicious intent.\n3.  **Root Cause Investigation:** Determine *how* this PowerShell command is being executed repeatedly.  Look for scheduled tasks, startup scripts, autorun entries, or other mechanisms that could be launching the command.\n4.  **Service Removal:** If the analysis of `tarefa_logico.exe` confirms it is malicious,  remove the \"objeto_ativo\" service and delete the associated executable file.  Use the following command in an administrative PowerShell prompt:\n\n    ```powershell\n    Remove-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -Force\n    Remove-Item \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" -Force\n    ```\n\n5.  **System Scan:** Perform a full system scan with a reputable antivirus\/anti-malware solution.\n6.  **Review Security Posture:**  Review firewall rules, user permissions, and other security settings to identify and address any vulnerabilities that might have allowed the malware to be installed.\n7.  **Incident Response:**  Follow your organization's incident response plan.\n8.  **Forensic Analysis:**  Consider a forensic analysis of the system to determine the full scope of the compromise and identify any data exfiltration or other malicious activity.\n\n**This situation warrants an urgent and thorough investigation. The repeated service creation is a strong indicator of a serious security compromise.**"}
