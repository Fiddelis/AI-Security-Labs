{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This log shows the creation and startup of a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell.  Let's break down what's happening and what to be concerned about.\n\n**Key Observations & Explanation**\n\n* **PowerShell Execution:**  The `powershell.exe` command is the culprit.  This indicates that a PowerShell script is being executed.  This is a common method for attackers to run malicious code, as PowerShell is a powerful scripting language built into Windows.\n* **Service Creation:** The script is creating a new Windows service using `New-Service`:\n    * `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`: This defines the name of the service as \"objeto_ativo.\" This is important for identifying the service in Task Manager or Services.\n    * `-BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`: This specifies the path to the executable that will be run when the service starts. **This is the most critical piece of information.**  The executable is located at `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  The file name `tarefa_logico.exe` suggests the service has something to do with logic tasks or similar functions, but it is important to confirm that this program is legitimate.\n    * `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`: This starts the newly created service.\n* **Unusual File Path:** The location `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin` is suspicious.  It's *not* a standard Windows directory. The directory names (\"unidade_logico\", \"registro_comum\", \"entrada_base\") appear to be Portuguese, which might indicate localization issues or something more deliberate.  Malware often tries to blend in by using seemingly legitimate-sounding file paths.\n* **Repeated Execution:** The same PowerShell command is executed multiple times (at least 6 times). This isn't necessarily malicious in itself, but it's unusual and might be related to persistence mechanisms or error handling during service creation.\n\n**Severity and Potential Risks**\n\nThis activity has a **High** severity level due to the following reasons:\n\n* **Malicious PowerShell:** The use of PowerShell is a major red flag. It's a common tool for attackers.\n* **Suspicious File Path:** The location of the executable is highly suspicious and likely a sign of malware.\n* **Service Creation:**  Creating a service allows the malicious code to run automatically in the background, even when a user isn't logged in.  This is a persistence technique.\n* **Unknown Executable:** We have no information about what `tarefa_logico.exe` does.  It could be a Trojan, a keylogger, a ransomware component, or some other malicious program.\n\n**Recommended Actions**\n\n1. **Isolate the System:**  Immediately disconnect the affected computer from the network to prevent further communication with potential command-and-control servers or spread of the malware.\n2. **Investigate the Executable:**\n    * **Upload to VirusTotal:**  Upload `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` to VirusTotal ([https:\/\/www.virustotal.com\/](https:\/\/www.virustotal.com\/)) to see if it is recognized as malware by various antivirus engines.\n    * **Static Analysis:** If you have the skills and tools, perform static analysis of the executable (e.g., using a disassembler) to understand its behavior.\n    * **Dynamic Analysis (Sandbox):** Run the executable in a sandbox environment (a virtual machine) and monitor its actions to see what it does.\n3. **Remove the Service:**\n    * Open the Services application (search for \"services\" in the Start Menu).\n    * Locate the service named \"objeto_ativo.\"\n    * Right-click the service and select \"Properties.\"\n    * In the \"General\" tab, stop the service.\n    * In the \"General\" tab, change the \"Startup type\" to \"Disabled.\"\n    * Click \"Apply\" and then \"OK.\"\n    * Delete the `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` file and its associated directory.\n4. **Scan for Malware:** Run a full system scan with a reputable antivirus\/anti-malware program. Consider using multiple scanners.\n5. **Review PowerShell History:** Examine the PowerShell history to see if there are other suspicious commands that were executed.\n6. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**  Malware often uses multiple methods to ensure it runs even after reboots. Look for suspicious entries in the following locations:\n    * Startup folder: `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup`\n    * Registry keys: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`\n7. **Rebuild the System (Recommended):**  The most secure option is to completely wipe the hard drive and reinstall the operating system from a trusted source.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Portuguese Localization:**  The Portuguese directory names suggest that the system is either localized or that the attacker is trying to disguise the malware by using familiar-sounding names.\n* **Reporting:**  If you suspect a security incident, report it to your IT security team and consider reporting it to the appropriate authorities.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide definitive security advice. This analysis is based on the information provided in the log and should be considered a starting point for further investigation. A qualified cybersecurity professional should be consulted for a comprehensive security assessment."}
