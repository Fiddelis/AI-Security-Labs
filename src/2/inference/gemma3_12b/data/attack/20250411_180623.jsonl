The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script, along with the multiple .NET image loads, raises suspicion of potential script execution and evasion attempts.  The repetitive 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events related to 'Get-Date' are also unusual, suggesting activity designed to obscure the main goal.
