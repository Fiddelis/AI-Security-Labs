The repeated PowerShell activity coupled with the creation of a file named 'entrada_logico.txt' suggests potential reconnaissance or malicious script execution. The file creation by `winlogbeat.exe` and repeated process accesses are likely benign, but warrant closer inspection alongside the PowerShell and `tasklist` activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
