The files are all JavaScript files in a specific path under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The names of the files have hashes in them, which might be normal for resource files.

It's possible that it's part of some software, but if it's creating a lot of files in the Office directory, that might be suspicious. However, the files are named like officeaicopilot-strings.min... which sounds like it could be part of an Office add-in or something similar. The hashes in the filenames might be checksums or versions, which is common in some applications.\n\nBut then, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same file being created repeatedly could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process, but the repetition might indicate something unusual. Also, the Security Group Management event without a process might be a log error or a different type of event that doesn't fit with the rest.\n\nI should consider if these are normal operations. If the user is running Office and has some add-ins, maybe this is expected. However, the high number of file creations and the same process involved might be worth investigating.

The files are named with a pattern like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a hash. There are multiple instances of the same files being created, which might be normal if it's part of an installation or update process. However, the repetition could also indicate something malicious, like a dropper or persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there's a couple of events related to chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit suspicious because Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry unless it's part of its own setup. But combined with the other events, maybe there's a connection.\n\nNow, the key points here: SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's creating a lot of files in a non-standard location, that's a red flag. The repeated creation of the same files might be a sign of a malicious payload being dropped multiple times. However, the file paths are within the Microsoft Office directory, which could be part of a legitimate update or a malicious package masquerading as an Office component.\n\nThe presence of both file creation and registry modifications by different processes might indicate a multi-stage attack. But without more context, like the source of the files or any network activity, it's hard to say. However, the fact that the same files are created multiple times could be a sign of a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user is using a newer version of Office that includes these files, it might be normal. But the hashes in the filenames are unique, which might not be standard for legitimate updates. Also, the fact that the files are JavaScript files could be a concern, as they might contain malicious scripts.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch shows multiple file creations by a process that's not typically associated with creating such files, along with registry changes by Chrome.

So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some kind of package or resource. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process related to Office, right? It's part of the Office Deployment Tool or something similar. So, creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be part of installing or updating Office add-ins or solutions. But why are there so many entries for the same file paths? Wait, looking at the paths, they all have the same structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\... So the directory is the same, and the files are all in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. \n\nBut the filenames are different each time, with different hashes or identifiers. That might be normal if they're different versions or different resources being installed. However, the fact that the same process is creating multiple files in that location repeatedly could be a red flag. But I should check if this is typical. \n\nAnother thing to note is that all the events are FileCreated with the same rule: FileCreate. That might be a specific detection rule in the system. But the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate. However, sometimes attackers might abuse legitimate processes. But in this case, the files are JavaScript files, which are common for Office add-ins. \n\nWait, but the filenames are all minified JavaScript files. That's common for web resources, but in the context of Office, maybe they're part of a copilot feature or some other Office add-on. The presence of multiple files might indicate an update or installation of multiple packages. However, if this is a normal installation, the user might have initiated it, but if it's happening without user interaction, that could be suspicious. \n\nBut the logs don't show any other processes or events that would indicate malicious activity. All the events are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe. There's no mention of network activity, registry changes, or other suspicious behaviors. So maybe this is just a normal Office update or installation. \n\nHowever, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a specific directory might be part of a legitimate process. But I should also consider if there's any known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe. From what I remember, SDXHelper is a legitimate process, but if it's being used to drop malicious files, that could be a problem. However, without more context or other events, it's hard to tell. \n\nSince all the events are about file creation by a legitimate process in a location that's part of Office's structure, it might not be interesting. But the high number of events and the same process might be a sign of something else. However, considering that the files are in the expected directory and the process is legitimate, it's more likely to be normal activity. \n\nSo, the classification here would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are part of a legitimate Office installation or update process.

Each entry is a FileCreate event, and some of the filenames are repeated. However, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which I think is related to Microsoft's Office solution deployment. Maybe this is part of a normal installation or update process.

There are multiple entries for the same files, which might indicate that they're being created multiple times, but maybe that's part of a normal process.\n\nWait, but why so many files? Also, the process name is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Office, I think, related to some setup or deployment tools. But I need to be careful here. The fact that multiple files are created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be normal for Office updates or installations. However, the repetition of the same file paths being created multiple times could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process, but sometimes malware creates multiple files to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are two entries about svchost.exe and chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll. BitsProxy is part of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service, which is legitimate. But if those processes are loading it normally, that's okay. However, if there were other suspicious DLLs, that might be a problem. But in this case, it's a legitimate DLL.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the SDXHelper.exe activity is normal. The files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office-related files. The filenames include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which might be part of a legitimate update or localization files. However, the high number of files created could be unusual. But maybe it's just a large update with many resources.\n\nAlternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is being used here, but in a way that's not typical, that could be a problem. However, without more context, like other suspicious activities, or if this is part of a known malicious campaign, it's hard to say. The fact that all the events are related to file creation in a specific directory by a single process might not be enough to classify as interesting unless there's a known bad indicator.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch. The repetition of the same file being created multiple times could be a sign of something wrong. However, maybe the process is just creating the files once, and the logs are duplicates. But the same file path is listed multiple times, which might be redundant entries. Alternatively, maybe the system is trying to create the same file multiple times, which could be an error or an attempt to overwrite.\n\nHowever, without any other suspicious activities, like network connections to unknown IPs, unusual process behavior, or other security events, it's possible that this is just a normal Office update process. The presence of multiple file creation events could be part of a legitimate installation or update. Therefore, unless there's a known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe creating these files, it might not be interesting.\n\nBut I should also consider that the user might be looking for patterns. The fact that all these files are created by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory might be a pattern that's worth investigating further. However, the confidence here is a bit low because without more context, it's hard to be certain. The justification would be that the events are related to a legitimate process but the repetition and number of files might warrant further investigation. However, since there's no clear malicious indicator, it's on the edge. Maybe the confidence is around 0.5, but I need to check if there's any other clue.\n\nWait, looking at the filenames again, they all start with officeaicopilot-strings.min. \"Office AI Copilot\" is a feature in newer Office versions. So these could be part of a legitimate update. Therefore, the activity might be normal. Hence, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's part of a legitimate process.

Microsoft Office does have some helper executables, but I should check if this is a known legitimate file. However, the name SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring a bell as a standard Office process. Typically, Office-related processes have names like \"WINWORD.EXE\" or \"EXCEL.EXE,\" but helper tools might have different names. It's possible that this is part of an Office add-in or a third-party solution.\n\nNext, looking at the files being created. They're all JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. The filenames have hashes in them, which might indicate they're part of a package or update. However, creating multiple JavaScript files with unique hashes could be part of a legitimate update process, but it's also a common tactic for malware to drop files in such directories.\n\nThe fact that all these events are from the same process and the same directory might be suspicious. Legitimate software usually doesn't create so many files in a short period, especially if they're all in the same location.

But the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times (like officeaicopilot-strings.min_657bdffe7496ffbb1c3d61c61660e632.js appearing twice) might indicate an error or repeated attempts to create the same file, which could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nAlso, the use of the term \"OfflineFiles\" might be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses offline storage to avoid detection. However, Office might use offline files for caching. Without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple files with similar names and hashes might be part of a legitimate package, but the lack of other processes or events related to these files could be a concern.\n\nConsidering all this, while the events could be part of a legitimate process, the combination of the unusual process name, the location of the files, and the repetitive creation of similar files raises some flags.

If SDXHelper.exe is a third-party tool, this might be a problem.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple files being created with similar names but different hashes. That could indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, possibly as part of a data exfiltration or some other malicious activity. The fact that all these files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be a sign that they're being stored for later use, perhaps to avoid network requests.\n\nI should also check if there are any other processes involved. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory might be part of a legitimate setup, but without knowing the context, it's hard to say. However, the main concern here is the SDXHelper.exe activity.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated file creation by an unusual process in a sensitive directory with obfuscated filenames is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like chrome and excel processes), the overall pattern here is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Windows Defender is a legitimate process, but maybe the version number is a clue? Wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. I know that MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, but the version number might be outdated or not standard. However, I should check if that's a known legitimate version.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files named officeaicopilot-strings.min with various hashes. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, so creating these files might be part of a legitimate Office update or installation. But why are there so many repeated entries? Also, the filenames have different hashes each time, which could be normal for different versions, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there are several events where chrome.exe sets registry values. Setting registry keys isn't unusual, but the repetition might indicate something. However, chrome.exe is a common process, and it's possible that these are just normal operations, like updating settings or extensions.\n\nAnother event is chrome.exe creating a file stream for a downloadable Excel file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and its Zone.Identifier. Zone.Identifier is a marker used by Windows to indicate that a file was downloaded from the internet, so that's normal. The creation of the Zone.Identifier stream is a standard part of handling downloaded files.\n\nThere's also a DNS query event from chrome.exe, which is typical for browsing activity. However, without more context on the domain queried, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe events again, the repeated creation of JavaScript files in the Office directory might be part of a legitimate process, but the high frequency and the specific naming could be a red flag. However, I should consider that Office might be installing or updating language packs or other resources, which could involve creating such files.\n\nThe first event with chrome.exe and the MpClient.dll might be a concern if the DLL is not the expected version. But if the version is legitimate, then it's not a problem. However, since the user is asking for investigation, maybe the combination of these events is suspicious. The presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe and registry changes by chrome.exe might be part of a larger pattern. However, without more data, it's hard to confirm.\n\nOverall, the logs don't show clear signs of malware, but the repetition and specific file paths might warrant further investigation. The classification is \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple events that could be related to normal operations but might also indicate something unusual, especially the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe and the registry changes by chrome.exe.

That alone might not be suspicious, but I need to check the rest.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like am-et-ui-strings-json and others. Creating a lot of files in that location might be normal for Office updates or installations, but the repetition of the same files being created twice each could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process, but the volume might be unusual.\n\nNext, EXCEL.EXE is creating a file stream in a temporary directory, which is normal. However, there's a Zone.Identifier stream, which is usually created when a file is downloaded from the internet. That's part of Windows' security features to mark files as coming from the internet. But then, EXCEL.EXE is also loading some DLLs, like coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal.\n\nThe main thing here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a legitimate Office update, it might be okay. But if the files are being created in a way that's not typical, or if there's an unusual number of them, it could indicate something malicious. However, the file paths are within the expected Office directories, and the filenames suggest they're UI string resources for different languages. That might be part of a legitimate localization process.\n\nBut wait, the same files are being created multiple times. The first entry for am-et-ui-strings-json is created twice. That duplication might be a sign of something wrong. Maybe the process is being forced to create files repeatedly, which could be a sign of a malware trying to persist or modify system files. However, without more context, like other suspicious activities or errors, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, HxTsr.exe modifying the registry could be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses registry changes to set persistence. However, alone, it's not enough to be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has some potentially normal activities, but the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory might be worth investigating.

First, I'll scan through each entry to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path seems a bit unusual. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, but creating files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be normal for some operations. However, I should note that.\n\nNext, EXCEL.EXE is loading several system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them is normal. But I notice that EXCEL.EXE is also creating a temporary file (~$Cronograma...xlsx) in the Downloads folder and then deleting it. The creation and immediate deletion of a temporary file might be part of normal Excel operations, like auto-save or temporary edits. However, the fact that it's happening multiple times could be a red flag if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events from svchost.exe. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes can be normal. But multiple registry events in a short period might indicate some configuration changes, though without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nLooking again at the SDXHelper.exe events, there are two entries where it creates the same JavaScript file twice. Maybe that's just a repetition, but maybe it's part of an attack where the file is being repeatedly created. However, I don't see any obvious malicious content in the filenames yet.\n\nAnother point is the Pipe Created event from EXCEL.EXE. Creating a named pipe is normal for inter-process communication, but if it's being used to communicate with an external entity, that could be suspicious. However, without knowing the other end of the pipe, it's hard to tell.\n\nI also notice that some events have the process field as null, like the User Account Management event and the None task. Those might be system events that don't have a specific process associated, which is normal in some cases.\n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events seem to be legitimate, like Excel loading necessary DLLs and creating temporary files. However, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in unusual directories and the multiple registry changes might warrant further investigation. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of normal operations, but if this is part of a larger pattern or if there are other indicators of compromise (like network activity or unusual process behavior), it would be more concerning.

There are like 30 of those. But then there are a few entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\". Then, there are two entries from SDXHelper.exe with a file created in a specific path.\n\nHmm, so the majority of events are registry changes by Excel. But why would Excel be setting registry values so many times? That might be normal if someone is using Excel in a way that modifies the registry, but maybe not. However, the key thing here is that the other entries might be more suspicious. \n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe events, they are creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory.

There are multiple entries for different files, but they all seem to be part of Office packages, like office_strings, taskpane, and others with language codes. The process names are consistent: SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE. The EXCEL.EXE entries are about DNS queries, which might be normal if Excel is accessing external resources. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but I need to check if the file creation activities are normal. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory under various SolutionPackages.

These could be GUIDs, which are commonly used in Office packages for unique identifiers. So maybe this is just normal installation or update activity. But why so many files? Also, the same file is created twice in some entries. Maybe that's a red flag, but perhaps it's just logging the same event twice.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any signs of malicious behavior? The process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Office. If these files are part of a legitimate Office add-on or update, then it's normal.

However, since the confidence isn't extremely high, maybe it's a low confidence. But the user wants a classification. Given that all the processes are legitimate and the paths are expected, maybe it's not interesting.

The fact that multiple files are created with different language codes might be part of a legitimate installation or update process, especially if the user is setting up Office for multiple languages.\n\nBut wait, there are also some registry events and a DNS query from EXCEL.EXE. The registry events involve svchost.exe, which is a generic host process for Windows services. However, svchost.exe is normal and often used by various system services. The DNS query from EXCEL.EXE could be part of normal operations, like checking for updates or connecting to a server.\n\nLooking at the file paths again, all the created files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. Maybe these are being downloaded as part of an Office update or a language pack installation. The repetition of the same files being created twice each might be a red flag. But if the system is installing multiple language packs, that could be normal. However, if the same file is created multiple times in quick succession, that might indicate something else, like a loop or an attempt to overwrite files.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the process name SDXHelper.exe. If this process is known to be malicious, then creating these files could be suspicious. However, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. Still, the sheer number of files created might be unusual. Let me check the number of events. There are multiple entries for each file, but each entry is a separate event. So, each file is being created once, but the same event is logged twice. Wait, looking at the JSON entries, some of them have the same file path and process name. Maybe there's a duplication in the logs, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious.\n\nThe last event has process null and task \"None,\" which might be an error or a placeholder. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nPutting it all together, the main activity is SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office directory with language codes. If this is part of a legitimate Office installation or update, then it's normal. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and the same process could be a sign of something more if there's no corresponding user action or if the files are not part of a known legitimate package. Since the justification needs to be concise, I should check if there's any clear malicious intent. The lack of other suspicious activities like network connections to unknown IPs, unusual process behavior, or malware signatures makes me think this is more likely legitimate. However, the high number of files might still be worth investigating to confirm if they are part of a known Office component or if they are unexpected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show SDXHelper.exe creating language-specific JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which aligns with legitimate Office add-in or localization package installation behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry is a bit odd because both process and file are null, and the winlog task is \"None\". Not sure what that's about, but maybe it's a placeholder or an error. Then there are two entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in a specific path under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. That path seems a bit unusual. Why would a helper executable be creating a file in the Office package resources? Maybe it's part of a legitimate update or installation, but I should check if that's normal.\n\nNext, there are 22 entries all from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a lot of registry modifications. Excel typically doesn't modify the registry that much, especially if it's the same process doing it repeatedly. This could be a sign of something malicious, like a macro or malware trying to change registry settings to persist or alter Excel's behavior. However, it's also possible that it's part of a legitimate process, like an add-in or a macro that's doing a lot of registry changes. But 22 times in a row seems excessive.\n\nNow, the SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path is under the user's AppData, which is a common place for temporary files, but the filename is a JavaScript file with a long hash in the name. That might be a generated file, but the fact that it's being created by SDXHelper.exe, which I'm not familiar with as a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's related to some Office solution or package, but the name doesn't ring a bell. It's possible that this is a legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe repeated registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE are more concerning. Malware often modifies the registry to set persistence or change system settings. However, Excel could be doing this if it's running a macro that's making multiple changes. But 22 entries all with the same task might indicate automated or scripted changes. Also, the fact that the first two events are file creation and then a bunch of registry changes could be part of a larger attack sequence.\n\nPutting it all together: the SDXHelper.exe creating a file might be benign, but the numerous registry changes by Excel are suspicious. However, without more information, like the specific registry keys being modified or the context of the Excel process, it's hard to be certain. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE (22 events) suggest potential malicious activity, while SDXHelper.exe created a file in an unusual Office SolutionPackages directory.

The process name seems a bit unusual, but maybe it's a legitimate helper tool. The files are in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, which is part of the Office installation. The file names are ui-strings-json with different language codes, like nb-no and ne-np. These could be language-specific resources. However, the same file is created twice in the third event. Maybe that's a duplication error or a retry. The paths are all under the user's AppData, which is common for temporary or user-specific files. I don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity here. The process is associated with Office, which might be legitimate. But I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. If it's not, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The fact that the same file is created multiple times might be normal during installation or updates.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The file paths are all within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The names of the files seem to be language-specific UI string files, like mi-nz, mk-mk, ml-in, etc. That's a lot of different language codes. But why so many? Maybe it's a legitimate Office add-in or something, but the repetition might be a red flag.\n\nWait, there are multiple entries for the same files being created. Like the first two entries are the same file path. That's unusual. Why would the same file be created twice? Maybe it's a mistake in the logging, but more likely, it's an attempt to overwrite or repeatedly create the same file, which could be part of an attack.\n\nAlso, the process is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft's Office add-ins, specifically for the Solutions Gallery. But if it's creating a bunch of files in the SolutionPackages folder, maybe that's normal. However, the number of files and the repetition might not be normal.\n\nAnother point is that there's one event where EXCEL.EXE sets a registry value. That's a different process. But the rest are all SDXHelper.exe. Could there be a connection? Maybe the registry change is part of the same activity, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The repeated creation of the same files might indicate something malicious, but it could also be a benign process. However, the fact that there are multiple identical entries for the same file being created by the same process in the same directory is suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a larger attack where the files are being dropped or modified. But I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Since the files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for add-ins, maybe it's legitimate. However, the high number of files and the repetition might still be a sign of something wrong.\n\nI think the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there are a bunch of entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Registry value set\". There are seven of those. Then, there are multiple entries with SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData directory. The files have names that look like they might be language-specific UI strings or JavaScript files related to Office solutions.\n\nNow, the first thing that comes to mind is that EXCEL.EXE modifying the registry could be normal if it's part of a legitimate process, like updating settings. But if it's happening multiple times, maybe there's something unusual. However, the main concern here might be the SDXHelper.exe creating a lot of files. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with add-ins or solutions. The file paths mention \"SolutionPackages\" and \"PackageResources\", which are part of Office's structure for managing add-ins. \n\nBut wait, the files being created have names like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json\" and others. These look like they could be legitimate localization files. However, the repetition of file creation events might indicate that something is being deployed or installed. Also, the presence of multiple files with different language codes (like kok, lb, lo, lt, lv) might be normal if the user is setting up a multilingual environment. \n\nHowever, the key point here is that the events are all related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe and registry changes by Excel. If these are all legitimate, then it's not interesting. But if there's a pattern that's out of the ordinary, like an unusual number of files being created or registry changes that don't align with normal operations, it might be a red flag. \n\nAnother angle is the use of SDXHelper.exe. If this process is creating files in the user's AppData directory, which is a common location for user-specific data, but if it's doing so in a way that's unexpected, that could be suspicious. However, Office solutions often use this directory for storing packages and resources. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like unexpected processes, network connections, or command-line arguments that might indicate exploitation. The events are all related to legitimate processes (Excel and SDXHelper) performing actions that could be part of normal Office operations. However, the repetition of events might be worth investigating to ensure that there's no automated deployment or unauthorized installation happening. \n\nBut considering that the user has multiple file creation events for different language files, it might just be a legitimate setup for multiple languages. Without more context, like other events (e.g., network activity, unexpected processes, or unusual registry changes), it's hard to say. However, the presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe and repeated registry changes by Excel could be a sign of something that needs further investigation, even if it's not definitively malicious. \n\nSo, I think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and numerous file creations by SDXHelper.exe might indicate an unusual activity that's worth looking into, even if it's not clearly malicious. The confidence is around 0.6 because it's not certain, but there's enough to warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE and repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe in Office-related directories may indicate deployment of add-ins or unexpected behavior.
