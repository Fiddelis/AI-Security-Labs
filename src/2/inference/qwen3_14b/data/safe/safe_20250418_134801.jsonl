{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting enough for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are a few entries related to Microsoft Edge. The setup.exe file is being created and its creation time is changed. The process is MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.54.exe. That seems normal, like part of an update maybe. But then there's a setup.exe process creating a pipe, which might be normal too, but I need to check if there's anything suspicious.\n\nNext, there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, so that's probably legitimate. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. So those image loads might be okay.\n\nThen there's a lot of User Account Management events. That's a lot of entries. Maybe something related to account changes or logons? But all the processes are null here, which might mean they're system events. Not sure yet.\n\nThere's a services.exe logon and a special logon event. That's normal during system boot or user login. The PowerShell command is interesting. The command line shows it's checking for INF files with specific sections. The script is looking for defaultinstall sections in INF files, which are used during driver installation. But why would PowerShell be doing that? Maybe part of a legitimate process, but maybe also part of a malicious activity trying to find drivers to exploit.\n\nAnother thing is the creation of a file in the systemprofile's AppData folder for PowerShell. That could be normal, but sometimes malware uses such paths. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe chrome.exe making a DNS query is normal, but if there were multiple unusual queries or to suspicious domains, that would be a red flag. But here, it's just one entry.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are normal system activities like updates, logons, and legitimate process executions. The PowerShell script might be a bit odd, but without more context (like the output of the script or other related events), it's hard to say if it's malicious. The repeated User Account Management events could indicate some automated process, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nSo, I think the batch isn't particularly interesting. There's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events seem to be part of normal system operations and updates. The confidence is medium, but leaning towards not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect standard system behavior (Edge update files, legitimate DLL loads, PowerShell script checking INF files, normal logon activities).

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these events step by step. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. That's a configuration file for Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. But why is it being created twice? Maybe it's part of a normal installation or configuration process, but I should check if there's anything suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several instances of svchost.exe performing actions like setting registry values and creating files. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if it's doing unusual things, like creating files in unexpected locations or modifying registry keys, that could be a red flag. The entries here mention creating files in the DeliveryOptimization directory, which is part of Windows Update, so that might be normal. But I need to see if there's any pattern here.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer, so if Calculator.exe is loading it, that's normal behavior unless there's a malicious component involved. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same goes for Chrome.exe and Registry value changes, which could be part of normal operations.\n\nLooking at MsMpEng.exe, which is part of Windows Defender, loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate system file. CompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again is normal as well. The MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is creating a file in the Program Files directory, which is typical for updates. However, there's also a File Delete logged event for a temporary file, which might be part of a normal update process.\n\nThe MpCmdRun.exe entries involve loading MpClient.dll and creating a lock file in the Windows Temp directory. This is part of Windows Defender's operations, so that's normal. The conhost.exe and mintty.exe entries modifying registry valuesâ€”conhost.exe is part of the Windows console host, and mintty.exe is a terminal emulator, so those actions might be legitimate if they're part of user activities or scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events seem to be related to normal system operations, software updates, and legitimate processes. However, the repeated creation of the .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe might indicate a configuration change or a potential tampering if it's unexpected. But without more context, like unusual network activity, unexpected processes, or other anomalies not listed here, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.

No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nThen there's an entry with process null and task None. That might be a placeholder or an error in the log, but it doesn't indicate anything suspicious on its own.\n\nThe rest of the events are all about git.exe creating files in a user's Downloads directory, specifically within a node_modules folder related to a semver package. These are standard files for a versioning library used in software development. The fact that git is creating these files as part of cloning or initializing a repository is typical behavior. There's no indication here of unusual activity or malicious files being created.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of the events are routine operations by legitimate processes.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all from git.exe creating files in the node_modules\/semver directory. The files are things like major.js, minor.js, parse.js, and others. Then there's a folder called internal with some JS files too.\n\nHmm, first thought: git.exe is a legitimate tool, commonly used for version control. But creating a bunch of files in node_modules... Well, node_modules is where npm packages are installed, so semver is a package for semantic versioning. The files listed are part of that package. So maybe this is just a normal installation or update process.\n\nBut wait, why are all these files being created? If someone is using git to clone a repository, it's possible that the node_modules directory is being populated as part of the setup. However, typically, git doesn't create the node_modules folder itself. That's usually done by npm or yarn. So maybe the user ran a git clone, then did an npm install, which would create node_modules and its contents. But the logs here show git.exe creating the files, which might be a red flag if that's not the usual behavior.\n\nAlternatively, could this be a malicious activity? For example, if an attacker is using git to inject malicious code into the node_modules directory. But the files mentioned are standard ones in the semver package. The names like major.js, minor.js, etc., are typical functions in a versioning library. The internal directory with constants.js, debug.js, etc., also seems legitimate.\n\nAnother angle: the path starts with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206... which looks like a student's directory, maybe part of a course or project. The semver package is a common dependency, so this might be part of a normal development setup. The fact that all the files are created by git.exe might be a bit unusual, but if the user is using git to manage their project, and the node_modules are part of the repository, then it's possible. Though typically, node_modules are excluded from git repositories because they're generated by npm.\n\nWait, but if the user has node_modules in their git repository, that's not standard. Usually, you have a package.json and install dependencies locally. So maybe this is a case where the user is checking in node_modules, which is not best practice. However, the logs don't show any suspicious content in the files, just the creation of standard semver files.\n\nSo, considering all this, the activity seems legitimate. The multiple file creations are part of a normal npm package structure. The use of git.exe might be a bit odd, but if the user is using git to manage their project, even if it's not best practice to include node_modules, it's not necessarily malicious. There's no indication of unusual process behavior, no unexpected command-line arguments, no network activity mentioned, just file creation.\n\nTherefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because it's a normal part of setting up a Node.js project with git, even if the setup isn't optimal.

So, there are multiple entries here, all from git.exe creating files in the node_modules\/semver directory. The files created are various JavaScript files and some other files like package.json. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or pull changes, it's common for it to create files in the node_modules directory, especially if there are dependencies. However, the semver package is a common npm package for version parsing, so it's possible that this is part of a legitimate installation or update process.\n\nBut wait, all these files are being created by git.exe. Typically, git.exe might not be the one creating files in node_modules. Usually, npm or yarn would handle that. So maybe this is unusual. However, if the user is using git to clone a repository that includes node_modules, then maybe git is extracting those files. But I'm not sure if git.exe is responsible for that.\n\nAnother angle: the files being created are part of the semver package, which is a standard package. The presence of files like package.json, parse-options.js, and others are typical for a npm package. So if the user is cloning a repo that has a package.json, git might be part of the process, but usually, the actual installation would be done via npm install. \n\nHowever, if these files are being created by git.exe, that might be an indication of something off. Maybe the user is using a git hook or some script that's causing git to create these files. Alternatively, if the user is in the process of initializing a git repository and setting up node modules, but that's less common.\n\nBut looking at the paths, it's in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for users to work on projects. The fact that multiple files are being created in semver's internal directories could be part of a normal install, but the process is git.exe. That's the key point here. If git is creating these files, that might be an anomaly because normally, the package manager would handle that.\n\nHowever, without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to tell. But based solely on these events, it's possible that this is a normal activity, but the involvement of git.exe in creating node_modules files is suspicious. Maybe the user is using a tool that integrates git and npm, but that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, if this is part of a malicious activity, like a dropper that's using git to extract files, but that seems a bit of a stretch. The files themselves don't seem to be executable or anything that would be malicious. They're all JavaScript files and package configuration.\n\nConsidering all that, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's likely a normal process of setting up a project, even though the process is git.exe.

The user provided a bunch of JSON events, all related to files being created by git.exe in the node_modules\\tcomb\\lib directory. The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Git.exe is a normal process used for version control. When you clone a repository or pull changes, Git creates files as part of the process. The files mentioned are all in the lib directory of the tcomb package, which is a JavaScript library. So, these files are likely part of the standard package structure.\n\nLooking at the file names, they're all .js and .d.ts files, which are common in Node.js projects. The path is in the Downloads folder, which is typical for user-installed packages. Since the user is a student (based on the folder name \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"), it's possible they're working on a project that uses tcomb, a library for type checking in JavaScript.\n\nNow, considering security aspects. Malicious activity often involves unexpected file creation, especially in unusual locations or by processes that aren't typically involved in file operations. However, git.exe is a legitimate process, and creating files in node_modules is normal during installation or cloning. There's no indication of unusual behavior here, like files being created in system directories or with suspicious names.\n\nThe justification for \"NOT INTERESTING\" would be that these events are part of normal Git operations when setting up a project. The confidence is high because all the files are standard, and the process is legitimate.

All of them are about files being created in the same directory under node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\. The process involved is git.exe.

The files mentioned here are all JavaScript files, which are typical in a Node.js project. The path is within a user's Downloads folder, specifically in a folder related to a course on software quality. This seems like a legitimate development environment setup. There's no indication of unusual activity here, like files being created outside of the expected directories or by processes that aren't typically associated with git.

Each entry has the same process name and the same task, which is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files are all in the node_modules\\tcomb\\lib directory, and they're various JavaScript and TypeScript files.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is suspicious. Git.exe is a legitimate process, typically used for version control. When you clone a repository or pull changes, Git creates files as part of normal operations. The fact that multiple files are being created in the node_modules directory makes sense if someone is installing dependencies, like with npm or yarn. The tcomb library is a known JavaScript library for type checking, so those files being created could be part of a normal package installation.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any unusual pattern. All events are from the same process, same user (fiddelis), and same directory structure. No other processes are involved, and there's no mention of any other suspicious activities like network connections or unauthorized access. The files being created are all standard library files, not executable files or anything that would be a red flag.\n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers might use Git to exfiltrate data or create files in unexpected locations. However, in this case, the files are in a typical node_modules directory, which is common in JavaScript projects. The user might be working on a project that requires the tcomb library, so this is normal behavior.\n\nAnother angle: the confidence level. Since all the events are consistent with normal Git operations and package installations, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The justification would be that these are standard file creations during a Git clone or npm install. Therefore, the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal file creation operations by git.exe during repository cloning or dependency installation.
