{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Now, those are legitimate Windows DLLs, but the fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading them repeatedly might be normal if it's a legitimate process. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's an entry for rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll and a GUID. That GUID part seems a bit odd. Typically, rundll32.exe is used for running DLLs, but if it's being used with a GUID that's not standard, that could be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or a loader. The command line includes \"-Embedding\" which is sometimes used in malicious contexts.\n\nNext, there's svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe modifying registry values. While svchost is a normal process, frequent registry changes might indicate tampering. RuntimeBroker is usually related to UAC, so that might be normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nLooking at winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. That's a log file, so it's probably part of the monitoring tool's normal operation. Not suspicious here.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE loading several DLLs, including combase.dll, mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, and Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading amsi.dll and Defender DLLs could be part of normal operations, but if Excel is doing that, maybe it's being used to execute malicious code. However, the presence of Mscoree.dll (related to .NET) and mscoreei.dll is normal for Excel if it's using .NET components.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is running with the -secured flag, which is normal for WMI. Loading wmiutils.dll is expected here.\n\nThere are several entries with \"User Account Management\" tasks, but no process names. That might be normal system events, but if there are too many, it could be noise. However, the logs don't show any clear signs of account creation or modification, just the task name.\n\nThe Dns query from EXCEL.EXE might be normal if it's accessing external resources, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the rundll32.exe command with the GUID and \"-Embedding\" parameter. That's a red flag. Also, multiple ImageLoad events for SDXHelper.exe, but since they're loading legitimate DLLs, it's not clear yet. However, the combination of rundll32 with that command line and the other events might indicate a potential malicious activity. But I need to check if there are any other anomalies. The rest of the events seem to be normal system processes and legitimate activities. So, the confidence is moderate, but enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"Suspicious activity detected: 'rundll32.exe' executing a command with a GUID and '-Embedding' parameter, which is often associated with malicious payloads. Additionally, multiple 'ImageLoad' events for SDXHelper.exe (though loading legitimate DLLs) and repeated 'User Account Management' logs without clear context warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": \"MODERATE\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. So, the user wants to know if these logs are interesting for investigation. First, I need to look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first part, there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That's normal for some applications, but I should check if there's anything unusual. Then there are some User Account Management events, but they don't have process or file info, so maybe not relevant.\n\nNext, rundll32.exe is running with a command line that includes shell32.dll. That could be normal, but sometimes malicious actors use rundll32 to execute code. However, the command line here seems legitimate. Then there's svchost.exe and Registry value set events, which are common but might be part of normal system operations.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's probably part of the log shipping process, so not suspicious. EXCEL.EXE is opening a CSV file, which is normal. But then there are multiple Image loaded events for EXCEL.EXE loading various DLLs, including amsi.dll and Defender's MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. The Defender DLL being loaded might be part of the antivirus checking the file.\n\nThen there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which is related to WMI, and that's usually legitimate. The events about services.exe and logon are standard system processes. The later entries show EXCEL.EXE creating a shortcut in the Recent folder, which is normal when you open a file. The DNS queries are also normal for Excel when it's accessing external resources.\n\nWait, but there's a lot of EXCEL.EXE activity. Could that be a red flag? Maybe if Excel was doing unexpected things, but in this case, it's loading standard DLLs and creating a shortcut. The only thing that stands out is the repeated User Account Management events with no process info, but those might just be noise. Also, the SDXHelper.exe loading DLLs, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nOverall, most of these events seem to be part of normal system and application operations. There's no clear evidence of malware or suspicious activity. Unless there's something I'm missing, like unexpected network activity or unusual file paths, but from the given data, it doesn't look like a security incident. So, probably not interesting for investigation, but maybe further analysis is needed if there are other indicators.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of normal system and application activity, with no clear evidence of malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - **Excel.EXE** loading standard system DLLs (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) is typical for antivirus integration and web-related functionality.\n   - **WmiPrvSE.exe** and **svchost.exe** are standard Windows processes involved in WMI and system services, respectively.\n   - **Winlogbeat.exe** creating log files in the `Downloads` directory aligns with its role as a log shipper.\n\n2. **User Account Management Events:**\n   - Multiple entries with task \"User Account Management\" lack process\/file details, likely representing noise or incomplete logging.\n\n3. **File Creation:**\n   - **Excel.EXE** creating a shortcut (`real_values.csv.LNK`) in the `Recent` folder is expected behavior when opening files.\n\n4. **DNS Queries:**\n   - **Excel.EXE** performing DNS queries is plausible if the CSV file contains external references (e.g., URLs).\n\n5. **SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Loading system DLLs (`combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) could be benign, but further context (e.g., unusual command-line arguments, unexpected parent processes) would be needed to flag this as suspicious.\n\n### **No Clear Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- No unexpected network activity, unusual file paths, or anomalous process behavior.\n- No evidence of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect typical system and user activity. While **SDXHelper.exe** and **User Account Management** events warrant further scrutiny in isolation, they are not inherently malicious here. **No actionable threat** is evident from this dataset. \n\n**Recommendation:** Monitor for additional context (e.g., process tree, network traffic, file hashes) if these events occur in a broader suspicious context."}
