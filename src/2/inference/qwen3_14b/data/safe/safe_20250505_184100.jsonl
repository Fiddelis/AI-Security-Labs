But then there's Update.exe being created and run. \n\nWait, the first event is DiscordSetup.exe being run from the Downloads folder. That's normal for an installer. Then, the log shows that Update.exe is created in the SquirrelTemp directory. Squirrel is a framework used for updates, so that might be part of the normal update process for Discord. But then, Update.exe is loaded multiple times, and it's accessing various .NET DLLs. That seems okay if it's part of the legitimate update process.\n\nBut then there are a bunch of Process accessed events for Update.exe. The user has 12 instances of \"Process accessed\" with no file details. That might be normal, but maybe it's a sign of something. However, since Update.exe is part of the Discord update process, and Squirrel is a known framework, this might just be standard behavior.\n\nWait, but the user has a mix of legitimate-looking events. The files being loaded are from standard locations like Windows\\System32 and .NET directories. Also, the creation of Update.exe in the AppData directory is part of the update process. The fact that winlogbeat is creating a file might be unrelated, but that's a log shipper and could be normal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, all these events seem to be part of a legitimate software update process.

That's a lot of repeated entries. But then, there are a couple of \"File created\" events by \"Update.exe\" pointing to Discord.lnk files in different locations. Also, there are several \"Image loaded\" events for Discord.exe with various DLLs. \n\nWait, the first thing that stands out is that \"Update.exe\" is creating shortcuts to Discord. That might be normal if it's part of an update process, but creating multiple shortcuts could be a red flag. Also, the fact that the same process is being accessed repeatedly might indicate something's wrong, like a malware trying to maintain persistence.\n\nThen, looking at the Discord.exe image loads, those are standard DLLs for a graphics library, which is normal for Discord. But the combination of Update.exe creating these shortcuts and accessing processes repeatedly might be suspicious. However, I need to check if there's any other indication of malicious activity. The logs don't show any failed attempts, privilege escalation, or network activity. \n\nThe classification here depends on whether the repeated process accesses and file creations are normal. If Update.exe is a legitimate updater, then maybe it's just doing its job. But if there's no other context, the repeated events and creation of shortcuts could be indicative of a malicious process. However, without more data like network connections or unusual command-line arguments, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the key points are the multiple \"Process accessed\" events and the creation of Discord shortcuts by Update.exe. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the presence of these events might warrant further look into, even if it's not a clear-cut attack.

Let me start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for Discord.exe and Update.exe. The Discord process seems to be running normally, with typical activities like creating pipes, loading images (like ffmpeg.dll), and process creation. The command lines look legitimate, like the one with --squirrel-install, which I think is part of the installation process for some apps. There's also a crashpad-handler process, which is related to crash reporting, so that might be normal too.\n\nThen there's Update.exe. The first event mentions \"Process accessed\" but no file. Then there's a Process Create for Update.exe with a command line that includes creating a shortcut and setting up an icon. That seems like part of an update process. The image loads for Update.exe include some .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. Loading these is normal when running .NET applications.\n\nNow, looking for anything suspicious. The Update.exe process is accessing and loading files, but all the paths are in standard locations like AppData and Windows\\System directories. The command line for Update.exe seems to be part of a legitimate update process, creating a shortcut. The repeated Pipe Created events for Discord.exe might be normal for communication within the app.\n\nI don't see any unusual file paths, unexpected processes, or signs of malware. The events are all related to normal operations of Discord and its update mechanism. There's no mention of network activity, unauthorized access, or any errors that might indicate a problem. The presence of .NET DLLs is expected for Update.exe. The same process names and activities are repeated, which is typical for application updates and running.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs don't show any malicious behavior.

That seems normal because clrjit.dll is part of the .NET runtime. But then there are multiple entries related to Discord.exe. The command lines for Discord look standard, like typical arguments for a GPU process or utility. However, I notice that there are several \"Process accessed\" and \"Image loaded\" events for Discord.exe. \n\nWait, but the main thing that stands out is the \"Update.exe\" process creating files in the Start Menu Programs folder, specifically a Discord.lnk shortcut. Creating a shortcut in the Start Menu isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with other events, it might be part of a larger action. Also, there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events for Update.exe, which might indicate that it's interacting with other processes or files. \n\nHowever, the key point here is that the only potentially suspicious activity is the creation of a shortcut by Update.exe. But creating a shortcut is a common legitimate action, like when software installs shortcuts. However, if Update.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be a red flag. But in the given logs, there's no indication that Update.exe is malicious. The other processes, like Discord.exe, are all standard and their command lines seem normal.\n\nWait, but the first event mentions Update.exe loading clrjit.dll, which is a legitimate file. Then later, Update.exe is creating a Discord.lnk file. That might be part of a normal update process, like creating a shortcut after an update. However, the fact that there are multiple Process accessed events for Update.exe might suggest that it's being used in a way that's not typical. But without more context, like if the process is from a known location or if there are other anomalies, it's hard to say. \n\nOn the other hand, the majority of the events are related to Discord.exe, which is a legitimate application. The command lines are typical for a browser or application with various flags. The Image loaded events are for legitimate DLLs like ffmpeg.dll, which is used by Discord for video processing. \n\nSo putting it all together, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events are all related to normal operations of Discord and Update.exe, even though Update.exe is creating a shortcut.

There are several entries where \"Update.exe\" is accessing files or processes, but then there's a line where \"reg.exe\" is adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the value pointing to \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\Update.exe\" and starting Discord.exe. That seems like a red flag because adding a registry key in the Run folder is a common method for malware to persist across reboots.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of \"Pipe Created\" events for Discord.exe. While named pipes can be normal for inter-process communication, excessive creation might indicate something malicious, especially if combined with other suspicious activities. However, the key point here is the registry modification.

However, the fact that it's being registered in the Run key suggests that it's trying to maintain presence on the system.

These look like normal startup parameters for a legitimate application.\n\nNow, checking the image loads. The files loaded are things like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, libGLESv2.dll, etc. These are common libraries used by applications for graphics and media processing. For example, libGLESv2 and libEGL are related to OpenGL ES, which Discord might use for rendering. Vulkan and SwiftShader are also related to graphics, so it's plausible that these DLLs are part of Discord's normal operation.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, which is normal for applications that have multiple components or services. The repeated Process Access events could be part of the application's normal functioning, like accessing its own modules or resources.\n\nI don't see any unusual file paths or unexpected command-line arguments that would indicate malicious activity.

That seems normal for a legitimate application, but maybe not always. However, the command lines here are using the correct paths for Discord's installation, which might be legitimate.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of Process accessed and Pipe Created events for Discord.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but if there are too many, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, Discord is a known application that might use such features, so maybe not suspicious here.\n\nThe Update.exe process has several events, including image loaded, file created, and process accessed.

However, Update.exe is part of the Squirrel framework, which is used by some applications for updates. So that might be legitimate.\n\nBut wait, the command_line for one of the Discord.exe processes is \"--squirrel-firstrun\". That suggests it's part of an update process, which is normal. The presence of Update.exe and the Squirrel framework is common in some applications, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nHowever, the repeated Process accessed events for Update.exe might be normal, but maybe not. Also, the Image loaded events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll. Ffmpeg is a media tool, but if it's being loaded by Discord, that could be part of their features, like video processing. But I need to check if that's typical for Discord. I think Discord might use ffmpeg for some media functions, so that's possible.\n\nThe registry changes are modifying the default icon and the shell command for Discord. That's part of setting up the application's integration with the OS, so that seems normal. However, if these changes were made by an unauthorized process, it could be malicious. But in this case, it's reg.exe, which is a legitimate Windows tool for registry edits.\n\nThe only thing that stands out is the multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe. If there's an unusual number of pipes being created, it could indicate something like a backdoor or malicious communication. However, without more context, it's hard to say.

Normally, a legitimate application like Discord might have some process access, but so many in a short time could be suspicious. \n\nThen there's another File created event in the AppData directory for another Discord.lnk. Creating shortcuts in both the desktop and AppData might be normal, but maybe not. Then there's a Pipe Created event, which could be part of normal communication, but again, multiple instances might be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's also an event with reg.exe adding a registry entry under HKCU for Discord, setting it as a URL protocol.

The fact that reg.exe is used to modify the registry might indicate an attempt to alter system settings, which is often seen in malicious activities. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a benign explanation.

There are multiple process create, process access, image load, and pipe created events. The first entry shows the creation of Discord.exe with a long command line. The command line has various flags, which is normal for applications, but I should check for any suspicious parameters. The flags like --no-sandbox and --disable-features might be worth noting, but they could be part of the application's normal operation.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events. One of them is loading ffmpeg.dll. Ffmpeg is a common library, so that's probably legitimate.

But a high number of pipe creations could be a red flag, though I need to consider if this is typical for Discord.\n\nThen there are entries involving reg.exe, which is the Windows registry tool. The command lines show adding registry keys under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. The first reg.exe command adds a URL protocol association, and the second sets the default icon.

However, since the user is running Discord, which might need to register itself with the OS, this might be expected behavior.\n\nBut wait, the user is fiddelis, and the events are all related to Discord. The majority of the events are from Discord.exe, which is a known application. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications and numerous pipe events might indicate something unusual. However, without seeing any malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or unexpected processes, it's hard to say.\n\nI should check if there's any indication of the registry changes being malicious. The registry keys added are for URL protocol and default icon, which are standard for applications that want to handle custom URLs. For example, Discord might want to handle \"discord:\/\/\" URLs. That's normal. But if there were other suspicious registry changes, that would be a problem.\n\nThe command line for the first Discord.exe process has a lot of flags. The --no-sandbox flag is a red flag because it disables the sandbox, which is a security feature. However, some applications might use this flag for performance reasons or specific functionality. But in the context of a legitimate application like Discord, this might be acceptable. However, if this is a different application masquerading as Discord, that could be a problem. But the process name is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the user might be running a legitimate instance of Discord, and these events are normal.
