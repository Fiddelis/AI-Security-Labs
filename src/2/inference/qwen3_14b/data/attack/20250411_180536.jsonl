{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. The user wants to know if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not an issue. But then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe command line that uses sc.exe to create a service with a path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe\". The path has a lot of underscores and seems like it could be obfuscated. Also, the command is creating a service and starting it. That's a red flag because creating services is a common technique for persistence.\n\nAnother event shows sc.exe creating another service with a path like \"C:\\pacote_auxiliar\\registro_base\\modulo_ativo\\bin\\unidade_geral.exe\". Again, the path is obfuscated and not standard. Then there's a sc.exe start command for \"elemento_auxiliar\", which might be starting that malicious service.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Registry value set events for services.exe. That could indicate changes to the registry, maybe modifying service configurations. But services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so that might be normal. However, combined with the service creation, it's concerning.\n\nThe image load events for mscoree.dll and clr.dll are part of .NET runtime, which is normal. But if those are being loaded from unexpected locations, that could be an issue. However, the paths here are standard Windows directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of services with obfuscated names and paths, along with the use of sc.exe and cmd.exe, suggests an attempt to establish persistence on the system. Even though some events are normal (like chrome.exe and services.exe), the combination of these suspicious activities indicates potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of obfuscated services via sc.exe with non-standard paths, frequent PowerShell and cmd.exe process access, and registry modifications by services.exe. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanisms or malicious payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a list of system events in JSONL format. My job is to analyze them as a whole and determine if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to see what's happening. The events are about processes, file creations, and registry changes. Let's break them down.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are processes like 'tarefa_logico.exe' and 'estrutura_principal.exe' loading images (DLLs) from system paths like C:\\Windows\\assembly and C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET. These seem to be legitimate system files, maybe part of normal .NET operations. The 'Image loaded' events are common during process execution, so maybe nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there are several 'Registry value set' events from processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, elemento_ativo.exe, modulo_secundario.exe, powershell.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if multiple processes are modifying the registry, especially if they're not typical ones like svchost or powershell, that might be a red flag. However, in this case, some of these are standard processes. But I need to check if there's a pattern here.\n\nNext, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But if this is part of an installation, it's expected. However, if the file is in a user's Downloads folder, maybe it's a sign of user-initiated activity, which isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are 'Process accessed' events from powershell.exe. Accessing processes can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, but if it's done in a way that's unusual, it might be a sign of something else. However, without more context, like which processes are being accessed, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' entries, both are loading urlmon.dll from System32. Calculator is a standard Windows app, and urlmon.dll is part of the Windows URLMoniker, which is used for handling URLs. This seems normal.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority of the events are related to normal system processes and legitimate activities like file creation during software installation (winlogbeat) and standard registry modifications. There's no obvious pattern of malicious activity here. The processes involved are mostly common ones, and the files accessed are from standard system locations. However, the presence of multiple registry changes by various processes might be worth noting, but without more context or anomalies (like unexpected registry keys being modified), it's hard to classify this as suspicious.\n\nI should check if there's any repetition or unusual combination. For example, if a suspicious process is accessing sensitive files or making changes to critical registry keys. But in this case, the events don't show that. The only potentially interesting thing is the winlogbeat file creation, but that's a normal part of configuration. \n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't seem to indicate a security threat. They look like part of regular system operations and user activities. Therefore, the classification would be 'NOT INTERESTING' with moderate confidence, since there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect normal system operations and legitimate process behavior (e.g., .NET framework loading, registry changes by standard processes, file creation during software configuration). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
