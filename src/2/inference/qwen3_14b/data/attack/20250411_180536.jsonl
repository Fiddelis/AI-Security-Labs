{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. First, I'll look through the JSON entries to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events involve Chrome and PowerShell, with network connections and DNS queries. But then there are some commands that stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe process that runs sc.exe to create a service called \"elemento_principal\" pointing to a file path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\". The use of sc.exe to create and start services is common, but the file paths here are not standard system directories. They have a lot of subfolders and names that seem made up, which could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's another sc.exe command creating \"tarefa_principal\" with a path \"C:\\\\pacote_auxiliar\\\\registro_base\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_geral.exe\". Again, the path is non-standard. Also, the service names and file names don't match typical Windows services. \n\nLooking at the image loaded events, they involve .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate files, but the context here might be important. However, the main issue seems to be the creation of services with non-standard paths and the use of sc.exe multiple times. \n\nPowerShell and cmd.exe are being used, which is normal, but combined with these service creations and the suspicious file paths, it could indicate an attempt to install malicious software. The fact that multiple services are being created and started, along with registry changes, might be part of a larger attack. \n\nThe DNS queries and network connections from Chrome could be benign, like normal browsing, but when combined with the service creation and registry modifications, it's more concerning. The presence of multiple registry value sets by services.exe and sc.exe might indicate configuration changes that are part of the malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the combination of creating services with unusual paths, using sc.exe and cmd.exe to modify the registry, and loading image files that are part of .NET but in non-standard locations suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high enough to flag this as interesting, but not 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Unusual service creation via sc.exe with non-standard paths (e.g., 'modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe'), 2) Frequent registry modifications by services.exe and sc.exe, 3) PowerShell and cmd.exe usage combined with service creation commands, 4) Image loading of .NET DLLs in non-standard locations. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a normal activity, maybe part of installing software. But then there's powershell.exe with registry value set events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but sometimes in attacks. However, just setting registry values isn't necessarily bad. \n\nNext, there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe again. Not sure yet. Then another winlogbeat.exe creating the same file again. Maybe a reinstall or configuration change. Then RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe also doing registry changes. These are common processes, so maybe just normal user activity.\n\nLooking further, there are Image loaded events for urlmon.dll by calc.exe and Calculator.exe. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, so loading it isn't suspicious. But why is it being loaded by calculator processes? Maybe just normal operations, but sometimes attackers might use dlls for malicious purposes. However, the paths are system directories, which is normal.\n\nNow, checking for any patterns. The same file is created twice by winlogbeat. Maybe a configuration file. The registry events are spread across different processes, but none seem to be high-risk. No unusual processes or unexpected file paths. The ImageLoad events are for standard dlls. \n\nNo signs of privilege escalation, unexpected network activity, or suspicious commands. The events don't seem to form a sequence that indicates an attack. It's possible that the user is just installing or configuring software, which explains the file creation and registry changes. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the activities are mostly legitimate, no obvious malicious behavior. The confidence is medium-low because while there's no clear threat, the repeated events might warrant a closer look, but not enough to classify as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard system activity (file creation during software installation, registry modifications by legitimate processes, and normal DLL loading). No suspicious patterns, lateral movement, or malicious payloads detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
