{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' activities. One of the entries has a command line that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task with the command \"cmd \/c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the file path here is NonExistingScript.ps1. That seems like a red flag because the script doesn't exist. Attackers often use non-existent files to avoid detection, or maybe it's a typo. Also, using -ep bypass is a common technique to bypass execution policies, which is suspicious.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named 'win32times' with a similar command, but pointing to 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Again, the non-existing file name here. Scheduled tasks running PowerShell with bypassed execution policies are concerning. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a high-privilege account. That's a big red flag because legitimate tasks usually don't use such high privileges unless necessary.\n\nThen there's a file created at 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\win32times', which is the scheduled task folder. That's normal, but combined with the other events, it might be part of the setup. Also, there are multiple registry events, but they don't seem to be related to the suspicious activities. The svchost.exe and chrome.exe entries are just registry changes, which could be normal or part of other processes.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe events are creating files in the Downloads directory, which might be part of the logging or configuration, but not necessarily malicious. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe processes with non-existent scripts and scheduled tasks running under the system account points to potential malicious activity.\n\nI should check if the non-existing scripts are just typos or intentional. If the attacker is trying to execute a script that doesn't exist, that could be an attempt to inject code or a misconfiguration. Also, the use of schtasks with system account and daily execution suggests persistence mechanisms, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell using bypassed execution policies, non-existent scripts, and high-privilege accounts is highly suspicious. This is likely a security incident that needs investigation. The confidence here would be high, maybe around 0.9, because the indicators are strong and multiple events point to the same suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9,\n  \"REASONING\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Scheduled tasks created via schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands using '-ep bypass' (bypassing execution policies) and referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), which is a common tactic in malware. 2) Tasks configured to run daily under the 'system' account, indicating potential persistence mechanisms. 3) Repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe process creation with no clear benign purpose. These patterns strongly suggest an attempt to execute malicious code or establish persistence on the system.\"\n}"}
