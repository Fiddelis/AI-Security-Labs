{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a common scenario when someone is setting up a tool, maybe for monitoring or something else. The second event is powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, so maybe that's just a normal user activity.\n\nThen there are a couple of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. ProcessAccess usually indicates that another process has accessed the PowerShell process, which could be a sign of something malicious, like a different process trying to control it. But on its own, that's not necessarily bad. The last event is whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to get the current user's identity. That's pretty normal.\n\nNow, looking at the combination. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, but creating a .yml.new file might be part of its configuration. The PowerShell events are more common in both benign and malicious contexts. However, the ProcessAccess events might be worth noting. But without more context, like unusual command lines or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple PowerShell events and ProcessAccess might be suspicious, but not conclusive. The user might be doing something legitimate, like running scripts or configuring tools. However, the combination of these events doesn't clearly point to a security incident. I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because there's no clear malicious activity here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity (file creation by legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe) and standard system commands (whoami.exe). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities. One entry stands out: the cmd.exe command line includes creating a scheduled task with schtasks, which runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass. That's a common tactic in malware to bypass execution policies. The script paths mentioned, like c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1, don't exist (NonExistingScript), which might be a red flag. Attackers often use non-existent files to avoid detection, planning to deploy the script later.\n\nThen there's the creation of a scheduled task named \"win32times\" set to run daily under the system account. That's a bit suspicious because scheduled tasks running as system can have high privileges. Also, the fact that schtasks is being used multiple times, including querying the task after creation, might indicate an attempt to establish persistence.\n\nOther entries involve svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry value sets. While svchost is a normal system process, multiple registry changes could be part of configuration changes or malware activity. However, chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times might just be normal browser behavior unless there's a specific malicious action, but here it's just registry value sets without more context.\n\nThere's also a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file created is a YAML config file, which might be normal if it's part of setup, but without more info, it's hard to tell. The other file created by powershell.exe is a text file, which might be benign.\n\nHowever, the key points here are the scheduled task creation with PowerShell bypassing execution policies and the non-existent script paths. These are classic indicators of compromise. The repeated use of schtasks and the registry modifications could be part of setting up persistence or modifying system settings to hide the malware.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of these suspicious scheduled tasks, the use of -ep bypass, and the non-existent script files are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though there are some normal processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe, the combination here points towards something that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled task creation with PowerShell bypass (-ep bypass), non-existent script paths in command lines, and repeated registry modifications. These patterns are commonly associated with malicious persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
