{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. The possible classifications are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the events to see if there's any suspicious activity. Let me go through each entry one by one.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe have registry value set events. Then calc.exe has an image loaded event pointing to urlmon.dll. svchost.exe appears multiple times with registry events. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. \n\nWait, winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be normal if it's part of configuration. But maybe not if it's in a user's Downloads folder. However, that's not necessarily malicious. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems odd. Deleting processes might be part of a cleanup after an attack. Also, WMIC.exe is being used, which is a common tool for remote management but can be abused. \n\nThen there are multiple image loads of urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, but if it's being loaded by suspicious processes, that might be a red flag. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's anti-malware scanning, so loading that could be a sign of evasion techniques. MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender as well. \n\nThe command line for WMIC.exe shows deleting notepad.exe processes, which might be an attempt to remove evidence. Also, the presence of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess events could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate processes. \n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign but could be part of checking user privileges. However, combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. \n\nPutting this together: the batch has multiple registry changes, process accesses, and image loads of system DLLs. The use of WMIC to delete processes and the presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe commands could indicate malicious activity. The confidence here might be around 0.75 because there are several suspicious events, but not overwhelming evidence. However, I need to check if these events are part of normal operations. For example, svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are legitimate, but the frequency of registry changes and the specific DLLs being loaded might be more concerning. \n\nAnother point is the use of wmic to delete processes. That's not a typical user action and could be part of a malware's cleanup. Also, the image load of amsi.dll might be an attempt to bypass detection. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch does show some signs of potential malicious activity, even if not all events are directly harmful. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75 to 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system events exhibits several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Suspicious Process Activities**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` and `WMIC.exe`**: The use of `WMIC.exe` to delete `notepad.exe` processes (`\"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\"`) is highly unusual and could indicate an attempt to clean up evidence of malicious activity. This is often seen in post-exploitation phases.\n   - **`conhost.exe` and `chrome.exe`**: Frequent registry modifications by these processes, while not inherently malicious, may suggest abnormal behavior if not tied to legitimate user actions.\n\n2. **Unusual DLL Loads**:\n   - **`urlmon.dll`**, **`amsi.dll`**, and **`MpOAV.dll`** are loaded by processes like `WMIC.exe`. These DLLs are part of Windows' core functionality (e.g., `amsi.dll` is used by Windows Defender for anti-malware scanning). However, their loading by potentially malicious processes (e.g., `WMIC.exe`) could indicate evasion tactics or exploitation.\n\n3. **PowerShell and Command-Line Activity**:\n   - Multiple **`powershell.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** events with **`ProcessAccess`** and **`ImageLoad`** triggers suggest potential process manipulation or injection. This is a common technique in malware to execute payloads or bypass defenses.\n\n4. **File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`**:\n   - The creation of a `.yml.new` file in the user's **`Downloads`** directory by **`winlogbeat.exe`** (a log-shipper tool) is not inherently malicious. However, it could indicate misconfiguration or unauthorized access if the file is not part of a legitimate deployment.\n\n5. **Frequency of Registry Modifications**:\n   - The high frequency of **`Registry Value Set`** events by processes like **`svchost.exe`**, **`notepad.exe`**, and **`chrome.exe`** may indicate tampering with system settings or attempts to persist malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events show **indications of potential malicious activity**, such as process deletion, unusual DLL loading, and frequent registry changes. While not conclusive proof of an attack, these patterns are **sufficient to classify the batch as \"INTERESTING\"** and warrant further investigation by a security analyst.\n\n**Classification**: `INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence Level**: 0.75 (moderate to high suspicion due to multiple red flags)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all these JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of chrome.exe and powershell.exe activity. But wait, there's also some cmd.exe and schtasks.exe commands. Let me check the command lines. Oh, there's one where cmd.exe is running \"copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That sounds suspicious. The sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys executable, and replacing it with a backup file might be part of a malicious activity, like a backdoor.\n\nThen there's another cmd.exe command using schtasks to delete a task named \"win32times\". Deleting a scheduled task could be an attempt to remove evidence or prevent a scheduled malicious action. Also, the schtasks.exe process is mentioned with a command line that deletes the task, which might be part of the same attack.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry value changes. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, frequent access and registry modifications could indicate someone trying to configure the system for persistence or other malicious purposes. However, on its own, that's not necessarily bad.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is normal, as it's used to check the current user, but combined with other commands, it might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe key points here are the suspicious commands in cmd.exe, the deletion of a scheduled task, and the use of schtasks.exe. These could be indicators of an attacker trying to modify system files and remove traces of their activities. However, I should check if there are any other red flags. The registry events are frequent but not all are necessarily malicious. The combination of these events, especially the file copy and task deletion, makes me think this is worth investigating further. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant a closer look, but not definitive proof of a breach.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Attempt to replace 'sethc.exe' (Sticky Keys) with a backup file via cmd.exe, which is a common technique for creating backdoors. 2) Deletion of a scheduled task named 'win32times' which may indicate evidence removal. 3) Frequent PowerShell and registry modifications that could signal persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user mentioned looking at the entire batch as a whole, so I can't just look at individual events.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There are several processes involved: cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Image loaded, Process accessed, and File created. The files mentioned are mostly system files or Defender-related DLLs, except for one temporary file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory.\n\nNow, looking for suspicious patterns. The repeated use of powershell.exe with tasks like Process accessed and Registry value set might be normal, but combined with other events, it could indicate something. The File created event for a .ps1 script in the Temp folder is a red flag. PowerShell scripts in temporary directories are often used in attacks to avoid detection. Also, the fact that multiple ImageLoad events point to system DLLs might be normal, but if there's an unexpected DLL loaded, that's a concern.\n\nWait, the chrome.exe entries have ImageLoad events pointing to amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender. If these are being loaded by chrome.exe, that might be unusual. However, I'm not sure if that's a legitimate scenario. Maybe chrome is interacting with Defender, but I need to check if that's common.\n\nThe whoami.exe executions are straightforwardâ€”they're just checking the user identity. But the multiple ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe with a command line that includes \"& {}\" might be a sign of something. That command is empty, so maybe it's a placeholder or part of a larger script. Also, the presence of a FileCreate event for a .ps1 file in the Temp directory is concerning. Attackers often use temporary files to execute scripts, which can be part of a payload.\n\nAnother thing is the frequency of events. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and modifying the registry. If this is part of a legitimate process, it might be documented, but without more context, this could be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the FileCreate event for a PowerShell script in the Temp folder. That's a common tactic in malware to execute scripts without leaving obvious traces. Additionally, the ImageLoad events for Defender DLLs by chrome.exe might be normal, but it's worth checking. However, the presence of the temporary script file is a strong indicator that this might be part of an attack. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious indicators** that warrant further investigation, particularly due to the **creation of a PowerShell script in a temporary directory** and **unusual behavior involving PowerShell and Chrome**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Findings:**\n\n1. **File Creation in Temp Directory:**\n   - **Event:** `File created` for `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`.\n   - **Why Suspicious?** \n     - PowerShell scripts (`*.ps1`) in temporary directories are **common in malware** to avoid detection. This could indicate **script execution for malicious purposes** (e.g., payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration).\n     - The filename includes `PSScriptPolicyTest`, which may mimic legitimate PowerShell testing tools but could be a **stealthy obfuscation**.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent `Process accessed` and `Registry value set` events** for `powershell.exe`.\n   - **ImageLoad events** for system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`).\n   - **Why Suspicious?**\n     - PowerShell is a **common tool for attackers** to execute commands, bypass policies, or load malicious payloads.\n     - Loading .NET framework DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) could indicate **exploitation of .NET components** or **custom code execution**.\n\n3. **Chrome.exe Loading Defender DLLs:**\n   - **ImageLoad events** for `C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll` and `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll` by `chrome.exe`.\n   - **Why Suspicious?**\n     - `amsi.dll` is part of **Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface**. If Chrome is loading it, it may be **interacting with Defender** (e.g., for scanning), but this is **unusual** and could indicate **tampering with Defender** or **malicious use of its APIs**.\n\n4. **Repetitive PowerShell Execution:**\n   - Multiple `ProcessCreate` events for `powershell.exe` with command lines like `& {}` (empty script block) or no explicit command.\n   - **Why Suspicious?**\n     - This could be **placeholder activity** or part of a **larger script that is obfuscated or split into multiple events**. Empty commands may be used to **avoid detection** or as part of a **staged attack**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **File:** `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1` (PowerShell script in temp directory).\n- **Process:** `powershell.exe` with frequent `Registry value set` and `ImageLoad` events.\n- **DLL Loading:** `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` by `chrome.exe` (unusual context).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the PowerShell Script:**\n   - Analyze the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1` to determine if it contains malicious code (e.g., payload delivery, persistence, or command-and-control communication).\n   - Check for **signature-based detection** (e.g., antivirus flags) or **behavioral anomalies** (e.g., network traffic, file modifications).\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** (via Group Policy) or **EDR solutions** to track the script's execution and its impact on the system.\n\n3. **Examine Chrome and Defender Interactions:**\n   - Investigate why `chrome.exe` is loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`. This could indicate **malicious use of Defender APIs** or **tampering with Defender**.\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement or Persistence:**\n   - Look for signs of **registry modifications** (e.g., autorun entries, scheduled tasks) or **network traffic** (e.g., C2 servers) linked to the PowerShell script.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events **strongly suggest** the presence of **malicious activity**, particularly the creation of a PowerShell script in a temporary directory. Immediate investigation is recommended to **confirm the threat** and **mitigate potential damage**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The first event is a file delete by powershell.exe in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because deleting files, especially in Temp, might be part of cleaning up after malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be normal operations, but the repetition could indicate something automated. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother event shows a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be normal if they're setting up monitoring, but could also be a sign of someone trying to install a backdoor.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are a bunch of PowerShell scripts that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths are a bit suspicious with the \"..\\\" which might be trying to access parent directories. This could be part of a script trying to locate or execute malicious files.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution is normal, but the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific scripts in various directories might be part of a larger attack. The fact that multiple paths are checked could indicate the attacker is looking for a specific file to execute, maybe a dropper or something else.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack or data exfiltration. The logs don't show any unauthorized access or malicious payloads. The majority of events are either normal operations or benign checks. The confidence is moderate because while there are suspicious patterns, they could also be part of legitimate activities. But the combination of file deletions, repeated checks, and unusual paths makes it interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands checking for existence of suspicious .bat files in non-standard paths with '..\\\\' directory traversal, combined with a file deletion in Temp directory and repeated lifecycle events, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell is running a command that checks if a specific batch file exists. If it does, it exits 0; else, 1. That's a common script behavior, maybe checking for dependencies. But the command line is a bit long and has some paths that look like they might be trying to access different directories. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell. That's normal, but maybe if there are too many, it could indicate something. But not necessarily malicious yet.\n\nNext, multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll. Those are standard .NET components, so that's expected when running PowerShell scripts that use .NET. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute scripts temporarily. The file is a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it quickly might be an attempt to hide activity. That's a red flag.\n\nAnother file created in the Downloads folder, but that's less suspicious unless there's something else. However, the temp file's creation and deletion is more concerning.\n\nThen there are a bunch of registry events from Chrome. Setting registry values multiple times could be part of a legitimate process, but if it's Chrome doing that, maybe it's a browser extension or some other legitimate activity. Not sure yet, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nAnother PowerShell event with a different path check. Similar to the first one. Maybe part of a larger script that's checking multiple paths. Not sure yet.\n\nThen another image loaded for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate DLL, so that's okay.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script. This is a common technique used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces. The fact that it's done in the Temp directory and then deleted immediately is a sign of possible malicious activity. Also, the multiple PowerShell processes and the loading of .NET components might be part of a larger script or payload. However, the other events like Chrome's registry changes and the other PowerShell checks might be part of normal operations or other legitimate processes.\n\nBut the key red flags here are the temporary script creation and deletion. That's a strong indicator that something might be trying to execute a script stealthily. So, this batch of events is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious indicators** that warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activity:**\n1. **Temporary PowerShell Script Creation & Deletion**  \n   - A PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in the **`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`** directory and immediately deleted.  \n   - **Why this matters**: Malware often creates and deletes temporary files to avoid detection. This behavior is commonly seen in **script-based payloads** or **exploits** that execute code stealthily.  \n\n2. **PowerShell Path Checks with Ambiguous Paths**  \n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for existence of files in paths like:  \n     - `C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat`  \n     - `C:\\modulo_logico\\componente_padrao\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\componente_secundario_script.bat`  \n   - **Why this matters**: The paths use `..` (directory traversal) and non-standard directory names (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `objeto_ativo`), which may indicate **obfuscation** or **attempts to access hidden or non-essential scripts**.\n\n3. **High Volume of PowerShell Activity**  \n   - Multiple `Engine Lifecycle` events and `Image Loaded` events for PowerShell processes.  \n   - **Why this matters**: While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, **abnormal volume or frequency of usage** (especially with obfuscated commands) can indicate **malicious scripting** or **exploitation**.\n\n4. **Windows Defender DLL Loading**  \n   - PowerShell loads `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender component). While legitimate, **loading Defender DLLs in non-Defender contexts** could indicate **tampering** or **malware evasion techniques**.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious but Worth Noting:**\n- **Chrome Registry Modifications**:  \n  - Chrome processes modifying the registry multiple times.  \n  - **Context**: Could be due to extensions, updates, or legitimate browser behavior. Not inherently malicious but may require cross-referencing with Chrome logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events **deserves investigation** due to:  \n- **Stealthy file operations** (create\/delete scripts in Temp\/AppData).  \n- **Obfuscated PowerShell commands** with ambiguous paths.  \n- **Unusual PowerShell activity volume**.  \n\n**Next Steps**:  \n- Check the **full command-line arguments** of PowerShell processes (if available) for obfuscation.  \n- Analyze **file hashes** of the deleted script (if recoverable).  \n- Correlate with **Windows Defender logs** to see if the loaded DLLs are behaving normally.  \n- Investigate **user context** (e.g., admin rights, user activity) to determine if the process is part of a legitimate workflow or unauthorized activity.  \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**â€”potential indicators of **malicious scripting** or **exploitation**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve PowerShell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. Let me check the winlog tasks. There are several 'Registry value set' events, which might be normal, but I should check if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the third event, there's a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content. These commands are creating files and writing content to them. The paths mentioned are a bit suspicious because they have multiple '..' which might be trying to navigate up directories, possibly to evade detection. For example, \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\...\" â€“ the '..' could be an attempt to access parent directories, which is sometimes used in malicious scripts to hide the actual path.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. These are legitimate system files, but loading them might be part of a .NET-based attack. However, since they're standard system files, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be related to PowerShell's own processes, but the repeated creation of scripts in temporary directories (like the last event where a file is created in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp) is concerning. Malware often uses temporary directories to store scripts to avoid leaving traces. The filenames like __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 might be trying to mimic legitimate script names to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple instances of creating and writing to .bat files with the command \"dir\" seems odd. Normally, you'd expect more complex commands if it's part of an attack, but maybe it's a test or a placeholder. However, the repetition and the use of PowerShell to manipulate files in various directories could indicate an attempt to execute or persist scripts.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell events, creation of files in temp directories, use of '..' in paths, and repeated file creation might indicate an attack. However, without more context like network activity or unusual processes, it's a bit tricky. But given the patterns, I'd lean towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON events exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, as they align with behaviors commonly associated with malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell for File Manipulation**:\n   - Multiple events involve `New-Item` and `Set-Content` commands in PowerShell scripts. These commands create files and write content to them, often in non-standard or obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..\\pacote_base\\...`). The use of `..` suggests attempts to navigate directory hierarchies, potentially to evade detection or access sensitive areas.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Creation in Temporary Directories**:\n   - A file is created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`. The filename includes a prefix (`__PSScriptPolicyTest`) that may mimic legitimate PowerShell script names, possibly to avoid suspicion. Temporary directories are often used by malware to store transient files.\n\n3. **Repetition of File Creation Patterns**:\n   - The same structure of creating `.bat` files with the command `dir` is repeated across multiple events. While `dir` is a benign command, the repetition and the use of PowerShell to generate these files could indicate an attempt to execute or persist scripts, possibly as part of a larger attack chain.\n\n4. **Loading of .NET DLLs**:\n   - Events involving the loading of `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are legitimate but could be part of a .NET-based payload or attack. The absence of context (e.g., no clear correlation with benign processes) makes this behavior noteworthy.\n\n### **Potential Malicious Behaviors**\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The creation of files in temporary directories and the use of PowerShell scripts may indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n- **Obfuscation and Evasion**: The use of `..` in file paths and the naming of temporary files suggest efforts to obfuscate the attacker's activities.\n- **Command-and-Control (C2) Communication**: While not explicitly visible in the logs, the repeated file creation could be a precursor to downloading or executing payloads from remote sources.\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n- **Correlate with Network Logs**: Check for outbound connections to suspicious IPs or domains that might indicate C2 communication.\n- **Analyze Script Content**: Inspect the contents of the created `.ps1` and `.bat` files for malicious code (e.g., encoded payloads, PowerShell obfuscation).\n- **Monitor User Activity**: Investigate the user account (`fiddelis`) for unusual behavior, such as unauthorized access or lateral movement.\n- **Check for Process Injection or Memory Artifacts**: The loading of `.NET` DLLs could be part of a process injection attack; memory analysis may reveal further clues.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events are **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell-based file manipulation, suspicious file paths, and repetitive patterns that align with common attack techniques. Further analysis of system logs, network traffic, and file contents is required to confirm malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There's a file deletion, some file creations, image loads, and registry changes. The file paths mentioned are in temporary directories or AppData, which can sometimes be a red flag because attackers often use those areas to hide malicious files.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is creating files and checking if certain paths exist. For example, one event shows creating a script file in C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\objeto_comum_script.bat. Another one is writing \"dir\" to another script. These could be benign, but combined with other activities, they might indicate something more.\n\nThe image loads include .NET framework DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but the multiple image loads could be part of a larger process. Also, the registry value sets might be changing settings, but without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nHowever, I notice that most of these events are routine operations. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, so creating files and modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad. The fact that some files are in temporary directories might be normal too. But the repeated use of PowerShell with various file operations and image loads could be a sign of something suspicious, especially if there's a pattern or if these actions are out of the ordinary for the system.\n\nWait, but the user said to consider the entire batch as a whole. Are there any events that stand out as potentially malicious? The first event deletes a script file in the Temp directory, which might be cleanup. The other file creations could be part of legitimate scripts. The image loads are standard for PowerShell. The registry changes might be part of normal operations or configuration changes.\n\nHmm, but without more context like baseline behavior or other indicators, it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple PowerShell activities might be normal in some environments. However, the fact that there are several file creations and deletions, along with registry changes, could be part of a malicious activity, such as setting up persistence or executing payloads. But I need to be careful not to assume without evidence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of a legitimate software installation or configuration script. Without knowing the normal behavior of the system, it's challenging. But the logs don't show any obvious malicious payloads or connections to external sources. The command lines are simple checks for file existence and creating scripts, which could be part of a larger process.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a lot of PowerShell activity which can be a red flag, the individual events don't clearly indicate malicious intent. It might be worth further investigation, but on its own, it's not conclusive. So, I would say it's somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious. The answer should reflect that there are indicators that could be concerning, but without more context, it's not certain.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **multiple PowerShell-related activities** that could be **benign or suspicious**, depending on the context and baseline behavior of the system. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Operations**: \n     - Multiple file creations (e.g., `C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\objeto_comum_script.bat`) and deletions (e.g., a script in `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) are logged. While temporary directories are common for legitimate scripts, **deletion of files in `Temp`** might indicate cleanup, which could be part of a larger process (e.g., malware or legitimate software).\n     - Scripts like `dir` being written to files suggest **basic scripting operations**, which are common but could be part of **payload execution** if combined with other suspicious behaviors.\n\n   - **Image Loads**:\n     - PowerShell loads **.NET framework DLLs** (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). This is **normal for PowerShell** but could be part of **malicious code execution** if these operations are **unusual** for the system.\n\n   - **Registry Changes**:\n     - Multiple `Registry Value Set` events are logged. While registry modifications are common during software installation, **lack of context** makes it hard to assess intent.\n\n2. **Command-Line Patterns**:\n   - Repeated use of `Test-Path` in PowerShell scripts (e.g., checking existence of files like `C:\\modulo_secundario\\...`) suggests **conditional logic**. This could be **legitimate** (e.g., checking prerequisites) or **malicious** (e.g., probing for existing files before execution).\n\n3. **File Paths**:\n   - Files are created in **system directories** (`C:\\componente_geral`, `C:\\registro_secundario`) and **temporary directories** (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`). These locations are **common for both legitimate and malicious activities**, requiring further context (e.g., user behavior, application usage).\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators (Potential Red Flags):**\n- **High Volume of PowerShell Activity**: While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, **excessive or unexplained use** (especially in non-admin contexts) may indicate **script-based attacks**.\n- **File Deletion in Temp Directories**: Could be part of **malware cleanup** or **legitimate temporary operations**.\n- **Lack of Context**: No evidence of **external connections**, **payload execution**, or **user interaction** (e.g., UAC prompts) is present, making it harder to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **normal PowerShell operations** that could be **legitimate** (e.g., scripting, configuration). However, the **frequency of file operations, registry changes, and use of temporary directories** raises **low-to-moderate suspicion**. **Further investigation** is needed, such as:\n- Correlating with **user behavior** or **other logs** (e.g., network activity, process tree).\n- Checking for **unusual permissions** or **unauthorized software**.\n- Analyzing the **content of created scripts** (if accessible).\n\n**Verdict**: **Potentially Suspicious** â€“ warrants closer examination but not definitive proof of malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is running scripts that check if certain files exist. The command lines all follow a pattern: using Test-Path to check for a specific .bat file in various directories, then exiting with 0 or 1. That seems a bit odd. Why would someone check for these .bat files so many times? Maybe they're trying to see if those files are present as part of some automated process or maybe probing for existence.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there's a mix of 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Image loaded', 'File created', 'File Delete logged', 'Pipe Created', etc. The 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' entries are for temporary PowerShell script files. That's normal in some cases, but the repeated creation and deletion might be part of a larger process. But then again, PowerShell often creates temporary files during script execution.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some of the PowerShell processes are loading DLLs from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's legitimate, as those are part of the antivirus. So that's probably not a red flag.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process running, which is a standard command to get user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe repeated use of Test-Path with different file paths might indicate that the attacker is checking for the presence of certain files, possibly to determine if a previous step was successful or to see if specific conditions are met. However, without seeing the actual content of those .bat files or more context on the outcomes of these checks, it's hard to say if this is malicious. But the fact that there are so many such checks in different directories could be a sign of something automated, maybe part of a larger attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes performing these checks might be indicative of a script that's trying to execute certain commands based on the existence of these files. However, the logs don't show any actual execution of the .bat files, just checks. That's a bit strange. Maybe the scripts are part of a setup or configuration process, but the repetition and the number of different directories could be a red flag.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these are benign processes. For example, some applications might use PowerShell scripts to check for dependencies. However, the sheer number of these checks and the different paths might be too much for a normal application. It's possible that this is part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of certain files before proceeding with exploitation or data exfiltration.\n\nBut without more information, like the actual content of the scripts, network activity, or other system events, it's a bit hard to be certain. The logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to suspicious IPs, or modifying system settings. However, the repetitive nature of the Test-Path commands in multiple locations might be worth further investigation. It's not a smoking gun, but it's enough to flag this for a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs provided shows a pattern of PowerShell activity that warrants further investigation, though no definitive malicious behavior is evident. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive `Test-Path` Checks**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `.bat` files in various directories (e.g., `C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\estrutura_secundario\\bin\\entrada_base.exe`). This is repeated across 15+ entries with different paths.\n   - **Suspicious Pattern**: The consistent use of `Test-Path` to probe for specific files in non-standard locations (e.g., `bin\\` subdirectories) may indicate an attempt to determine the presence of files for conditional execution (e.g., checking if a prior step succeeded or if a payload exists).\n\n2. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity**:\n   - **Legitimate**: PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, and `Test-Path` is a standard cmdlet. The logs also include legitimate entries, such as loading Windows Defender DLLs (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`), which are expected in a secure environment.\n   - **Suspicious**: The sheer volume of `Test-Path` checks and the lack of clear purpose (e.g., no actual execution of the `.bat` files) could suggest probing for conditions or dependencies, which might be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., checking for the presence of tools before exploitation).\n\n3. **File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - Temporary PowerShell script files are created and deleted (e.g., `entrada_base.exe`, `tarefa_ativo.exe`). While common in some scenarios, the lack of context (e.g., why these files are being created) raises questions about their purpose.\n\n4. **No Immediate Malicious Activity**:\n   - No direct evidence of malware (e.g., file downloads, network connections to malicious IPs, or system modifications) is present in the logs.\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**: The activity is not outright malicious but exhibits **unusual patterns** that could indicate:\n  - **Probing for vulnerabilities** (e.g., checking for the presence of tools or files before exploitation).\n  - **Automation scripts** with unclear intent (e.g., conditional execution based on file existence).\n  - **Misconfigured or poorly designed scripts** (e.g., excessive `Test-Path` calls without clear purpose).\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Logs**:\n   - Check for associated network activity (e.g., connections to external IPs, data exfiltration).\n   - Investigate the contents of the `.bat` files referenced in `Test-Path` commands (if accessible).\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Implement logging and alerts for unusual PowerShell activity (e.g., frequent `Test-Path` calls, execution of scripts from non-standard locations).\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Determine if the user or process executing these commands is authorized to perform such checks (e.g., part of a legitimate application or administrative task).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs do not confirm malicious activity but highlight **unusual PowerShell behavior** that merits further investigation. The repetitive `Test-Path` checks and lack of clear context suggest a need for deeper analysis to rule out potential security risks. **This batch is flagged as \"interesting\" due to the suspicious pattern, but no conclusive evidence of compromise is present.**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. The first event is a process creation where PowerShell is running a script that checks if a certain file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That seems normal, but maybe the paths are suspicious. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe\" don't look like standard Windows directories. They have a lot of Portuguese terms, which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is using obfuscation or non-English paths to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate .NET components, so that's probably normal. But the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be okay too, unless there's something unusual about how they're being used.\n\nThere's a FileCreate and then a FileDelete event for a temporary script file. That's common in PowerShell scripts, but the fact that it's creating and immediately deleting a file might be part of a larger operation. Also, the script names like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1\" could be part of a test or legitimate activity, but sometimes attackers use such names to blend in.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated ProcessAccess events. These might indicate that the process is being manipulated or accessed by another process, which could be a sign of something malicious. However, PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, so it's not always malicious.\n\nThe Registry value set events are also there. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that there are multiple registry changes might be worth looking into.\n\nThe presence of \"whoami.exe\" and \"cmd.exe\" running simple existence checks might be part of a script that's checking for certain files or conditions. But again, without seeing the actual payload or more anomalous behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the non-standard paths in the Test-Path commands, the repeated process access and registry changes, and the temporary file creation\/deletion. However, these could also be part of legitimate administrative scripts. The key is whether these activities are out of the ordinary for the system in question. Since the user hasn't provided context about the environment, I have to rely on the logs alone. The combination of these events, especially the unusual file paths and the multiple access events, makes me lean towards this being interesting for further investigation. But it's not definitive proof of malicious activity; it's just suspicious enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitive proof of malicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n\n1. **Unusual File Paths in `Test-Path` Commands**  \n   - PowerShell scripts repeatedly check for files in non-standard, obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe`).  \n   - These paths use **Portuguese terms** (e.g., `registro_ativo`, `objeto_ativo`) and mimic legitimate system directories, which could indicate **obfuscation** or **non-English-based malicious activity**.\n\n2. **Frequent Process and Registry Activity**  \n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `Registry value set` events suggest **potential tampering** or **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying registry keys to maintain access).  \n   - PowerShell is used to interact with the registry, which is common in legitimate scripts but could also be part of **malicious configuration changes**.\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**  \n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. While common in scripts, this behavior could mask **ephemeral malicious payloads** or **anti-forensics techniques**.\n\n4. **Loading of Windows Defender DLLs**  \n   - PowerShell loads `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components). While legitimate, this could be a **smokescreen** to mimic benign behavior or bypass detection rules.\n\n5. **Repeated `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` Usage**  \n   - Simple existence checks (e.g., `IF EXIST %%temp%%\\objeto_logico.txt`) are performed. These could be part of **legitimate scripting** but may also be used to **probe for specific conditions** (e.g., checking for the presence of a dropped file).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Context**  \n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:  \n  - PowerShell is widely used for administrative tasks, and temporary files\/registry changes are common.  \n  - Paths with non-English terms may reflect user-specific configurations or scripts.  \n\n- **Malicious Red Flags**:  \n  - The **combination** of obfuscated paths, frequent process\/registry access, and ephemeral file operations raises concerns about **stealthy persistence** or **data exfiltration**.  \n  - The lack of clear purpose (e.g., no visible payload or network activity) makes the behavior **anomalous** and warranting deeper inspection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**  \nThis activity is **interesting enough for further investigation**, especially if:  \n- The system is not known to use non-English paths or Portuguese-based scripts.  \n- There are **no logs of user-initiated administrative tasks** (e.g., PowerShell scripts run by legitimate users).  \n- Correlated logs (e.g., network traffic, file modifications, or user behavior) show **unusual patterns**.  \n\n**Next Steps**:  \n- Analyze **process tree** (e.g., parent-child relationships) to identify if these processes are spawned by unexpected parents.  \n- Check for **network activity** (e.g., DNS queries, HTTP requests) from these processes.  \n- Inspect **file hashes** of the temporary script and any files referenced in `Test-Path` commands.  \n- Review **user context** (e.g., if the user account is privileged or compromised).\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict**  \n**Suspicious â€“ Further Investigation Required**  \nThe logs contain **indications of potential malicious behavior** (e.g., obfuscation, registry tampering) but lack definitive proof. Contextual analysis and correlation with other logs are critical to determine if this is benign or malicious."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the patterns here.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with 'powershell.exe' being accessed or created. That's common, but the frequency might be a red flag. Then, there are some 'cmd.exe' and 'whoami.exe' processes. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate tool, but when combined with other activities, it could be part of something malicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands that check for the existence of specific files. For example, \"Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\...\" and similar paths. These checks might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present, which could be part of a larger attack, like checking if a payload has been deployed or if a certain condition is met before proceeding.\n\nThen, there are entries about image loading, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are .NET framework components, so loading them isn't inherently bad. However, if PowerShell is loading these DLLs, it might be executing .NET code, which could be used for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of the same commands. Multiple instances of PowerShell checking different paths might indicate a pattern, possibly part of a script that's probing the system for specific files or directories. The use of 'Provider Lifecycle' in some events might relate to PowerShell providers, which can interact with the file system or registry in ways that could be abused.\n\nI should also consider the combination of events. The fact that there are multiple process creations and accesses, along with registry value sets, could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or execute code. However, without more context like network activity or unusual file modifications, it's a bit hard to tell.\n\nBut considering the number of PowerShell events and the specific command patterns, this might be indicative of a script that's trying to check for the presence of certain files, possibly as part of a staged attack. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these activities could be benign, but the combination of multiple PowerShell commands checking for specific files and loading .NET DLLs raises enough suspicion to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Suspicious\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The logs show repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific file paths (e.g., Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\registro_principal...\\\"), which may indicate probing for the presence of malicious payloads or system artifacts.

While not definitively malicious, the pattern warrants further investigation due to the high volume of PowerShell activity and non-standard file path references.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe, which is common but can be a vector for attacks. The first event mentions an image loaded from a Windows Defender DLL. That's a legitimate path, so maybe that's normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which is followed by a file delete. That might be part of a script testing or temporary files, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, there are several events with command lines that check if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The names of these files are repeated in different paths. Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with keyloggers, which are malicious. Even though the scripts are checking for the existence of these files and exiting, the mere presence of such filenames in multiple locations could indicate an attempt to locate or execute a malicious script.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Process Create events for PowerShell, which might be normal, but combined with the repeated references to Get-Keystrokes.ps1, it raises a red flag. The fact that the same script name is checked across different directories might suggest that the attacker is trying to find where the malicious script is stored, possibly to execute it later.\n\nHowever, none of the events show actual execution of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script, just checking for its existence. So it's not definitive proof of a security breach, but it's a strong indicator that something unusual is happening. The combination of these checks and the PowerShell activity could be part of a larger attack, like a phishing attempt or a dropper that's looking to deploy a keylogger.\n\nI should also check if there are any other signs, like registry changes or process access, but those events don't seem to indicate anything overtly malicious. The main concern here is the repeated mentions of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious script name. \n\nSo, the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a pattern that warrants further investigation. It's not a confirmed attack, but the presence of those script names in multiple locations with PowerShell activity is suspicious enough to require closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains **multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, though no direct malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repetitive References to `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`**:\n   - **Multiple PowerShell processes** are checking for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in various directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`, `C:\\objeto_temporario\\...`). \n   - **`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** is a **highly suspicious filename** associated with **keylogging malware**. While the scripts only check for the file's existence (and exit without executing it), the **repetitive probing** across different paths suggests **active searching for a malicious script**.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **High volume of PowerShell processes** (e.g., `Process Create`, `Process Access`, `Registry value set`). PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, but **excessive or unusual usage** (e.g., repeated checks for specific scripts) raises red flags.\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest...` is **created and immediately deleted** in the Temp directory. This could indicate **script testing** or **attempted cleanup** of evidence, which is often seen in **malicious payloads**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious**\n- **Legitimate**: \n  - The initial image load from a **Windows Defender DLL** is expected.\n  - Temporary file creation\/deletion is common in script execution.\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - The **repeated checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** are **not typical** in benign scenarios. This pattern is consistent with **malware reconnaissance** (e.g., looking for a staged payload).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Classification**: **Interesting for investigation**.\n- **Reason**: The **repetitive probing for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** and **abnormal PowerShell activity** suggest **potential pre-staged malicious activity** (e.g., a dropper searching for a keylogger). While no direct execution is observed, the **pattern is highly indicative of a security incident** requiring deeper analysis (e.g., checking file hashes, monitoring for subsequent execution of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, or reviewing network traffic for exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate the presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in the directories mentioned, analyze the PowerShell scripts for obfuscation, and monitor for further anomalous behavior."}

But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1, and then it's deleted. That might be part of a script execution, but creating and deleting a temp file isn't necessarily bad. However, the next entry shows a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication, maybe for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking further, there are command lines for PowerShell scripts checking if Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists. The filenames have paths like \"C:\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico...\", which seem a bit odd. The names \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" are suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with keyloggers, which are malicious. Even though the scripts aren't executed yet (they just check existence), the presence of such files could indicate an attempt to run a keylogger.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events for PowerShell, which is common but could be part of a larger attack. The fact that there's a file created and then deleted might be an attempt to hide activity. The Pipe Created event could be a red flag, as attackers sometimes use named pipes for communication between processes.\n\nOther entries involve whoami.exe and calc.exe, which are normal utilities, and svchost.exe with registry changes. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events and the suspicious filenames stand out. The key here is the combination of PowerShell loading .NET components, creating a temp script file, and the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious indicator.\n\nEven though some events are normal, the overall pattern suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the keylogger-related script name and the temp file creation\/deletion are strong indicators.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first entry is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I should check if there's anything suspicious there. The file path seems to be part of an installation, maybe.\n\nThen there's a bunch of powershell.exe processes. The first one is just ProcessAccess, which isn't too bad. But then there's whoami.exe being run, which is a legitimate command to check the current user. But then, later, there's a powershell.exe with a command line that includes \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". That could be a red flag because recursing through directories might be part of searching for files, which could be benign, but in some contexts, it might be part of a malicious activity like looking for sensitive data.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are several .dll files being loaded, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Those are legitimate, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be normal for PowerShell scripts. However, the key point here is whether any of these files are from unexpected locations or if there's any unusual activity.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of events. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry values being set. That could indicate some automated script running, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The Chrome.exe network connections and DNS queries are probably normal browsing activity.\n\nThe main concern here is the combination of the file creation by winlogbeat.exe and the PowerShell activities. If winlogbeat is being used normally, that's fine, but if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious behavior, that's a problem. However, in this batch, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive files.
