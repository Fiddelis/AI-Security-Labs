{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with svchost.exe and chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. Those are common processes, so maybe normal activity. But then there's the cmd.exe and net.exe commands. Wait, looking at the command_line for one of the cmd.exe entries: it's adding a user called \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password and adding them to the Domain Admins group. That seems suspicious. Also, there's another command with \"net1.exe\" which might be a typo or a malicious binary, since the legitimate net.exe is part of Windows, but net1.exe isn't standard. \n\nThen there's the use of PowerShell multiple times, which can be both normal and malicious. However, combined with the user creation and domain admin additions, that's a red flag. Also, the files created by winlogbeat and powershell might be part of logging, but the repeated file creation in SRUtmp.log by svchost.exe could be normal, but maybe not. \n\nAnother thing is the command_line for the net.exe and net1.exe processes. They're adding users and groups with specific names and passwords. The passwords have \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and \"elemento_ativo_pass123!\", which look like temporary or default passwords, possibly set by an attacker. Also, the use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a sign of a malicious executable, as the legitimate tool is \"net.exe\". \n\nThe presence of multiple process creations and registry modifications by cmd.exe and powershell.exe suggests someone is trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges. Adding users to Domain Admins is a significant action that would typically require administrative privileges, which could indicate a compromise. \n\nThe justification would be the suspicious user creation commands, the use of non-standard executables like net1.exe, and the multiple registry and process access events that could indicate unauthorized changes. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points to potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net.exe'\/'net1.exe' with weak passwords, unusual process executions (e.g., 'net1.exe'), and repeated registry modifications. These indicate potential privilege escalation and account compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
