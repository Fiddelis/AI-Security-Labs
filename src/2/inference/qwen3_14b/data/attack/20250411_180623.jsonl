{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, right? Browsers often do DNS lookups. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe with registry value set. PowerShell is commonly used for scripts, but setting registry values could be part of normal operations or maybe something malicious. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with the command line \"Get-Date\". That's a simple command to get the current date and time. Seems benign. But then there are multiple entries of ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events. The image loads include some .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so maybe part of normal PowerShell operations. But then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute scripts temporarily and then clean up. The file is a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it quickly might be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events. Those might be related to PowerShell's internal processes, but repeated entries could indicate something unusual. Also, the Pipe Created event might be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad but could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this together: The main red flags are the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script. Even though the command is simple, the fact that it's created and then deleted could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. The multiple image loads of .NET components might be part of using PowerShell for more complex tasks. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll in the image loads suggests that the system's antivirus is involved, which might be a false positive or could indicate that the script was detected.\n\nBut wait, the script is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which sounds like a test script. Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, like testing script policies. However, the fact that it's created in the Temp directory and then deleted might still be suspicious. Also, the repeated Provider Lifecycle events could indicate that the PowerShell process is being manipulated or that there's an attempt to evade detection.\n\nConsidering all these points, it's not definitively malicious, but there are enough suspicious activities (temporary script creation, multiple image loads, lifecycle events) that warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities could be normal, but the combination of events makes it interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes loading .NET runtime components (mscoree.dll, clr.dll) and creating\/deleting a temporary script file in the Temp directory, which may indicate obfuscation or execution of scripts with cleanup attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That path is under AppData, which is common for user-specific data. But creating a file there might not be suspicious on its own. However, PowerShell is often used for scripting, so maybe something's going on here.\n\nNext, there's another PowerShell event with a registry value set. Registry changes can be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might indicate configuration changes or malicious activity. Then conhost.exe also sets a registry value. Conhost is a Windows process related to console windows, so maybe that's just part of normal operations, but combined with PowerShell, it's worth noting.\n\nThe next event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation, especially if it's being set up or updated. But the same file is mentioned twice, once with winlogbeat and once with PowerShell. Wait, no, looking again, the fourth and eighth events both mention winlogbeat creating the same .yml.new file. That might be a normal part of installation or configuration, but maybe the user is trying to set up Winlogbeat, which is a legitimate tool.\n\nThen there's another PowerShell event creating a text file in Downloads called estrutura_logico.txt. That's a regular text file, maybe just a log or data file. Not necessarily malicious, but again, depends on context.\n\nAnother PowerShell event with a registry value set, and then a Process accessed event. Process access could be normal, but if it's accessing sensitive processes, that might be a red flag. However, the event just says \"Process accessed\" without specifying which process or what action was taken. So not enough info there.\n\nNow, looking at the overall picture. The main suspicious elements are the multiple PowerShell activities, creating files and modifying the registry. However, some of these are in legitimate contexts, like Winlogbeat configuration. The presence of multiple registry changes and file creations by PowerShell could indicate someone trying to configure or modify the system, which could be benign or malicious. But without more context, like unusual commands, network activity, or other signs of compromise, it's hard to say. However, the fact that PowerShell is involved in multiple file creations and registry changes might be worth investigating further. The classification here is likely \"INTERESTING\" because there's enough activity that could be part of an attack, even if not definitively malicious. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while there's no direct evidence of malware, the combination of events is suspicious enough to warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating files and modifying registry values, which could indicate legitimate user activity or potential malicious behavior. The presence of Winlogbeat-related file creation suggests possible log shipping configuration, but the combination of registry changes and file operations by PowerShell warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
