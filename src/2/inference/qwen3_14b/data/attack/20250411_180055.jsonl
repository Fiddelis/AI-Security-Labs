{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple entries of Process Access, Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created and deleted, and some Provider Lifecycle events. The command lines involve using Compress-Archive with paths that look like they're from various directories, maybe some temporary or application-specific paths. \n\nHmm, the first thing that stands out is the repeated use of PowerShell. While PowerShell is a common tool, its frequent use in these logs might be a red flag, especially if it's doing things like accessing the registry, loading images, and creating\/deleting files. But I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all use Compress-Archive to zip certain paths. The paths mentioned are a mix of system directories and user-specific temporary folders. The use of $env:TEMP suggests temporary storage, which is normal. However, the fact that there are multiple compressions happening might be part of a larger process, like preparing files for transfer or execution. \n\nWait, there's also the Image Load events. The files loaded include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might indicate that the system is scanning or something is being detected. But since it's a legitimate file, maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nThen there's the File Create and Delete events. A temporary script file is created and then immediately deleted. That could be part of a normal script execution, but if it's happening frequently or without a clear purpose, it might be suspicious. However, the justification here is that the script is being tested with PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be part of a legitimate policy check. \n\nBut wait, the command lines don't show any obvious malicious commands. They're just compressing files. However, the repetition of these compressions across different directories and the use of PowerShell might be a sign of something automated. Maybe someone is trying to move files around or prepare them for execution, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the number of events. There are multiple entries with similar patterns, which could indicate a script or process that's running repeatedly. However, without seeing the actual content of the compressed files or more context on why these compressions are happening, it's a bit hard to determine if this is malicious or just part of normal operations.\n\nThe presence of the Pipe Created event might be normal, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nIn summary, while the logs show a lot of PowerShell activity and file operations, none of the individual events clearly point to malicious activity. However, the volume and repetition might warrant further investigation to ensure that these actions are part of legitimate processes and not something more sinister. But based on the information given, I might lean towards it being a false positive or a normal process, but the high number of events and the use of PowerShell could be a red flag for someone monitoring for potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **frequent PowerShell activity** and **file operations**, but **no clear indicators of malicious behavior**. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Multiple `Process Create` and `Provider Lifecycle` events involve PowerShell executing `Compress-Archive` commands. These commands are used to compress files from various directories (e.g., `C:\\modulo_temporario\\...`) into temporary locations (`$env:TEMP\\...`). \n   - **Legitimate Use Case**: Compressing files is a normal operation, often seen in backup, deployment, or data transfer scenarios.\n\n2. **File and Registry Activity**:\n   - **File Operations**: Temporary script files are created and deleted (e.g., `$env:TEMP\\modulo_comum.zip`), which could be part of a **legitimate script execution workflow** (e.g., testing with `PSScriptPolicyTest`).\n   - **Registry and Image Loads**: References to `.NET` framework components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and **Windows Defender** (`MpOAV.dll`) are legitimate system processes.\n\n3. **Repetition and Patterns**:\n   - The repetitive use of `Compress-Archive` across different directories may indicate **automated workflows** or **custom scripts**. However, without context (e.g., purpose of the compressed files), it’s hard to determine if this is benign or suspicious.\n\n### **Potential Concerns**:\n- **High Volume of PowerShell Activity**: While PowerShell is a common tool, **excessive or unusual usage** (e.g., without clear purpose) could warrant further investigation.\n- **Lack of Context**: The logs do not include details about the **content of compressed files** or the **source\/destination of files**, which could be critical for determining intent.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\n- **No direct evidence of malicious activity** (e.g., exfiltration, code injection, or anomalous network behavior).\n- **False Positive or Legitimate Activity**: The events appear to be part of **normal system operations** (e.g., compression, testing, or deployment scripts).\n- **Recommendation**: Monitor for **unusual patterns** (e.g., compression of sensitive files, unexpected network transfers) or correlate with **other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user behavior) for deeper insights.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not suspicious** based on the provided data, but **contextual analysis** is needed to confirm legitimacy."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal because Defender's MpClient.dll is a legitimate file. But I should check if there's any unusual activity around it.\n\nNext, there are several entries where powershell.exe is used with Compress-Archive. The command lines show that they're compressing directories into temporary files. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\elemento_secundario\\tarefa_padrao\\tarefa_geral\\bin\\componente_auxiliar\" don't look familiar. However, using Compress-Archive itself isn't necessarily bad. But the fact that it's done multiple times might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide data within compressed files?\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module, which is legitimate. So the use of that module isn't suspicious. However, the repeated use of Compress-Archive in different directories could indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities by packing files.\n\nThere are also entries about registry value sets and process accesses. But most of these are from common processes like svchost.exe, notepad.exe, and others. The registry events alone aren't conclusive. However, the combination with the PowerShell activities might be more telling.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory is normal if someone is setting up a log agent, but it's not inherently malicious. However, the repeated file creation events might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nI should check if there are any anomalies in the process names. For example, \"Calculator.exe\" is mentioned, but that's a normal application. The ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll are also legitimate. The svchost.exe entries are common system processes, so they're not suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious activity seems to be the multiple uses of Compress-Archive with non-standard paths. This could be part of an effort to compress and potentially exfiltrate data, or to hide malicious payloads within the compressed archives. However, without more context, like network activity or the contents of the compressed files, it's hard to be certain. But the repetition and the use of PowerShell for such operations might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious patterns that merit further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns Identified:**\n1. **Repetitive Use of `Compress-Archive` in PowerShell:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing `Compress-Archive` commands to package directories (e.g., `C:\\componente_secundario\\registro_geral\\registro_ativo\\bin\\tarefa_ativo`) into temporary ZIP files (`modulo_ativo.zip`, `modulo_ativo.zip`, etc.).\n   - **Why This Matters:** While `Compress-Archive` is a legitimate tool, its repeated use to compress non-standard paths (with obscure names like `componente_secundario`, `registro_geral`) could indicate an attempt to **obfuscate malicious payloads** or **prepare data for exfiltration**. This behavior is often seen in malware or data-exfiltration scenarios.\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths:**\n   - The directories being compressed (e.g., `C:\\elemento_secundario\\tarefa_padrao\\tarefa_geral\\bin\\componente_auxiliar`) use non-English, non-standard naming conventions. This could be an attempt to **mask the true purpose** of the files or directories.\n\n3. **Lack of Contextual Clues:**\n   - No network activity, file modifications, or lateral movement is observed in the logs. However, the absence of such events does not rule out malicious intent—this could be **preparation for a later-stage attack** (e.g., staging data for exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Benign or Normal Activity:**\n- **Legitimate PowerShell Usage:** The use of `Compress-Archive` itself is not inherently malicious. It is a standard PowerShell cmdlet used for archiving files.\n- **System Processes:** Events involving `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and `notepad.exe` are typical for a Windows system and do not indicate malicious behavior.\n- **Windows Defender Path:** The loading of `urlmon.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (from Windows Defender) are normal system operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Compressed Files:**\n   - Analyze the contents of the generated ZIP files (e.g., `modulo_ativo.zip`, `modulo_ativo.zip`) to determine if they contain malicious payloads, sensitive data, or unexpected files.\n   - Check if these files are being exfiltrated via network activity (not visible in the logs provided).\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Correlate this activity with other PowerShell logs (e.g., script execution, remote command invocation) to identify if this is part of a larger attack chain.\n\n3. **Check for Anomalous File Paths:**\n   - Investigate the purpose of directories like `C:\\componente_secundario\\registro_geral\\registro_ativo\\bin\\tarefa_ativo`. Are these legitimate working directories, or are they being used as decoys?\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis:**\n   - Determine if this activity is part of a known benign process (e.g., a developer's workflow) or if it aligns with threat actor tactics (e.g., data compression for exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not confirm malicious activity, the **repetitive use of `Compress-Archive` on non-standard paths** raises a **low-to-moderate risk** flag. Further investigation is warranted to rule out obfuscation tactics or data-exfiltration attempts."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them are related to chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, there are a couple of other events that stand out.\n\nLooking at the 8th and 9th entries, there's an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so loading them might be normal. But wait, why is chrome.exe loading these? Typically, those DLLs are part of the system's security features. Maybe it's a red flag if chrome is interacting with them in an unexpected way.\n\nThen there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. However, the filename has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file. Not sure if that's significant here.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe being accessed twice. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but if it's being accessed without proper context, it could be a sign of something. However, there's no command line info here, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is used to display user information. That's a standard command, so probably not malicious. \n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events are chrome.exe doing registry changes, which might be normal. The image loads for Defender DLLs could be benign, but the combination with other events might be worth looking into. However, without more context like unusual command lines or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say if this is malicious. The presence of multiple registry changes and some process accesses could indicate a script or malware modifying the system. But I need to check if there's a pattern here. \n\nWait, the same registry event is repeated multiple times. If chrome.exe is setting registry values repeatedly, maybe it's part of a larger attack. But again, without knowing the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to judge. \n\nConsidering all that, the batch has some suspicious elements but not enough to be certain. The confidence isn't high, but there's enough to warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated registry modifications (Registry value set) and loading Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which could indicate evasion techniques or malicious behavior. Additional events include file creation by winlogbeat.exe and PowerShell process accesses, suggesting potential system interaction or data collection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
