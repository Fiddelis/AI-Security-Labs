{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe loading a file from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate path, so maybe normal activity. But I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe running a command with findstr and select-string looking for passwords in files. That's a common technique for searching for sensitive info. But is it malicious? Maybe, but could be a user doing a search. However, combined with other events?\n\nThird to fifth events: svchost.exe and Calculator.exe doing registry value sets and image loads. Those are normal processes. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is standard.\n\nNext, findstr.exe is executed with the same command as before. That's part of the initial search. Maybe part of a legitimate script.\n\nThen, multiple powershell.exe instances with registry value sets and process accesses. A lot of registry changes might be suspicious, but not always. If it's a benign script, maybe not. But if it's modifying critical registry keys, that's a red flag.\n\nOfficeClickToRun.exe doing DNS queries. That's part of Office updates, so normal.\n\nAnother powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for scripts, but could be used to store malicious data.\n\nThen, multiple chrome.exe entries with registry changes and DNS queries. Chrome doing a lot of registry modifications might be unusual. Also, DNS queries could be for malicious domains, but without the actual domains, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe last event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal. Unless the file path is suspicious, but it's a standard location.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple powershell.exe and chrome.exe activities, especially with registry modifications and file creation. The use of findstr to search for passwords might be part of a data extraction attempt. However, many of these events are from legitimate processes. The repetition of registry changes by chrome.exe and powershell.exe could indicate some automated process or script, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations, along with the password search, might suggest a potential security incident. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the user was just doing a search, but the frequency of events might be a concern. I think this is worth investigating further, so I'll mark it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activities. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Password Search:** Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands using `findstr` and `select-string` to search for sensitive terms (e.g., \"password\") in files. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate Use:** A user manually searching for credentials in files.\n     - **Malicious Use:** Automated data exfiltration or reconnaissance (e.g., searching for sensitive data to steal).\n   - **File Creation:** A file is created in the user's `Downloads` directory (`winlogbeat.yml.new`), which could be part of a legitimate configuration update or an attempt to plant malicious configuration data.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequent Changes:** Multiple processes (`powershell.exe`, `chrome.exe`) perform registry value modifications. While registry edits are common, **excessive or unexplained changes** could signal:\n     - **Persistence Mechanisms:** Malware attempting to maintain access.\n     - **Legitimate Scripts:** Automated tools or updates (e.g., `chrome.exe` updates).\n\n3. **Chrome Activity:**\n   - **High Volume of Events:** `chrome.exe` is involved in numerous registry modifications and DNS queries. This could indicate:\n     - **Normal Behavior:** Chrome's legitimate updates or extensions.\n     - **Suspicious Behavior:** If combined with unusual DNS queries (not shown here), it might hint at communication with malicious servers.\n\n4. **Windows Defender Path:**\n   - **Legitimate File Load:** `amsi.dll` and `winlogbeat.exe` are loaded from standard system directories. These are typically benign, but **unexpected execution from these paths** (e.g., if not part of known processes) could be concerning.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual PowerShell Scripts:** The repeated use of `findstr` to search for sensitive terms might indicate a **data collection phase**.\n- **Registry Modifications:** Frequent changes by non-system processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `chrome.exe`) could suggest **malware persistence**.\n- **File Creation in User Directories:** The creation of `.yml.new` files might be part of **malicious configuration deployment**.\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict:**\n**Interesting for Further Investigation**  \nWhile many events align with normal system behavior, the combination of:\n- **PowerShell's password search**,  \n- **Frequent registry edits**,  \n- **Unusual file creation**,  \n- **High Chrome activity**,  \n\nraises **moderate suspicion** of potential malicious activity (e.g., data exfiltration, persistence). Further analysis (e.g., checking DNS query destinations, inspecting PowerShell scripts, reviewing registry changes) is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. First, I notice that there are multiple entries related to chrome.exe performing various actions like loading an image, setting registry values, and making network connections. The first event shows chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That's a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't interact with Defender's files. Then there are several registry value sets and network connections from chrome.exe, which might be normal, but the repetition could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a file creation by powershell.exe in the user's Downloads folder. That's common for normal user activity, but I need to check if it's part of a larger pattern. Then, there are multiple entries of winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is related to log collection, so that might be legitimate. However, there's also a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign but could be part of a script.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that runs schtasks commands to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks might be part of a cleanup, but if done without user knowledge, it could be malicious. The schtasks.exe process itself is normal, but the command line shows deletion of tasks named things like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" which are generic names and might be placeholders for actual malicious tasks.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry events and process accesses by powershell.exe, which could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or access processes. The svchost.exe entry related to registry changes is normal, but combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together, while some activities are normal, the combination of chrome.exe interacting with Defender files, multiple registry changes, network connections, and scheduled task deletions could indicate a potential security threat. The use of schtasks to delete tasks might be an attempt to remove traces of an attack. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain, but the presence of these multiple suspicious activities warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlights**\n1. **Unusual Chrome Behavior**:\n   - **DLL Loading**: `chrome.exe` loads `taskschd.dll` (a legitimate Windows file), but the context of its interaction with **Windows Defender's directory** (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll`) is unclear. Chrome typically does not interact with Defender components, which could indicate an anomaly.\n   - **Network\/Registry Activity**: Repeated registry modifications and network connections from `chrome.exe` may suggest exploitation (e.g., through malicious extensions or compromised processes).\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**:\n   - **Deletion of Scheduled Tasks**: A `cmd.exe` process runs `schtasks \/delete` commands to remove tasks named `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon` and `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`. While task deletion itself is normal, the **generic task names** and lack of user context (e.g., no explicit user interaction) raise concerns. This could be an attempt to erase evidence of malicious activity or unauthorized access.\n\n3. **PowerShell and Cmd.exe Usage**:\n   - **File Creation**: `powershell.exe` creates files like `estrutura_ativo.txt` and `elemento_base_005_OnLogon` in the `Downloads` directory. While this could be benign, the **repetition of task-related filenames** (e.g., `unidade_...`) and the use of `schtasks` suggest potential scripting or automation for malicious purposes.\n   - **Process Access**: Multiple `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe` may indicate attempts to monitor or control other processes.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - **File Creation**: `winlogbeat.exe` creates `.yml.new` files, which are part of its normal operation. However, if these files are being modified or used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\n5. **Whoami.exe Execution**:\n   - The use of `whoami.exe` (to retrieve user identity) is typically benign but could be part of a script to gather system information for further exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Unusual Process Interactions**: `chrome.exe` interacting with Defender components and `schtasks.exe` in non-standard contexts.\n- **Scheduled Task Deletion**: Removal of tasks with generic names, potentially to obscure malicious activity.\n- **PowerShell Scripting**: Frequent use of `powershell.exe` for file creation and process access, which could indicate lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate Chrome Behavior**:\n   - Check for malicious Chrome extensions or tampered browser profiles.\n   - Monitor Defender logs for unusual activity or false positives.\n\n2. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Verify the legitimacy of deleted tasks (`unidade_...`) and ensure no malicious tasks remain.\n   - Review system logs for prior creation of these tasks.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell and Cmd.exe**:\n   - Analyze scripts or commands executed by `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` for signs of exploitation (e.g., `schtasks`, `reg`, or `Invoke-WebRequest`).\n\n4. **Check File Integrity**:\n   - Verify the contents of files created by `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` to ensure they are not malicious.\n\n5. **Network Traffic Analysis**:\n   - Investigate the network connections initiated by `chrome.exe` for communication with suspicious domains or IP addresses.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activities (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe` operations) are legitimate, the combination of **unusual Chrome behavior**, **scheduled task deletion**, and **PowerShell scripting** suggests a potential security incident. Further investigation into process interactions, file contents, and network traffic is warranted to confirm whether this is a false positive or an active threat."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of schtasks.exe with the \/delete command on a task named \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task could be part of an attempt to remove something malicious or hide activity. \n\nThen there's the WMIC process deleting notepad.exe processes. Deleting legitimate processes isn't normal, and using WMIC for such actions might be a red flag. Also, the command line for WMIC includes deleting a process, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or covering tracks.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of activity with PowerShell and cmd.exe, especially around registry modifications and process access. The repeated use of these tools, along with registry changes, might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or install backdoors. \n\nThe deletion of user accounts via net user \/del commands is another concerning point. Removing user accounts could be an attempt to eliminate access points or clean up after an attack. \n\nHowever, some of these events might be part of normal administrative tasks. For example, deleting a scheduled task could be legitimate if it's an old or unused task. But combined with the other actions like deleting processes and user accounts, it's more likely malicious. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate because while some actions are suspicious, they could be part of legitimate maintenance.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and conhost.exe. Those are common, but sometimes they can be used for malicious purposes. Let me check the commands. One of the cmd.exe entries has a command line that deletes a user with \"net user ... \/del \/domain\". That's a red flag because deleting domain users isn't normal unless it's part of a legitimate admin task, but without context, it's suspicious.\n\nAnother entry is \"sc delete win32times\", which deletes a service. Deleting services can be part of a malware's attempt to remove its own components or disrupt system functions. Also, there's a command to delete users and services, which might indicate someone is trying to compromise the system by removing traces or setting up backdoors.\n\nThere are multiple instances of Registry value set events. While registry changes are common, frequent changes, especially from processes like cmd and powershell, could indicate configuration changes by an attacker. Also, the User Account Management and Security Group Management events might suggest changes to permissions or user rights, which could be part of privilege escalation.\n\nHowever, some events don't have clear malicious intent. For example, \"whoami.exe\" is a standard tool for checking user context, and \"conhost.exe\" is a legitimate Windows process. But the combination of these processes with the suspicious commands and registry changes raises concerns.\n\nI need to weigh the number of events. There are several suspicious commands, but they might be part of normal administrative tasks. However, the repetition of deleting users and services, along with registry modifications, increases the likelihood of malicious activity. The confidence here is moderate because while some events are suspicious, without more context (like IP addresses, user accounts involved, or other system logs), it's not definitive. But enough indicators are present to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of domain users via 'net user \/del \/domain', service deletion via 'sc delete win32times', and repeated registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through this step by step. The user provided a list of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the processes involved. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is common but can be a red flag if used for malicious purposes. Then there's cmd.exe with some command lines that include deleting files in the Temp directory. The command line has \"del %%temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and similar paths. That seems suspicious because deleting temporary files might be part of cleaning up after an attack.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where the task is 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed'. Registry changes can be normal, but combined with other activities, they might indicate something's wrong. The 'File Delete logged' event points to the deletion of a file named 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe' in the Temp folder. That name includes 'decoded', which might suggest that the file was part of an encoded or obfuscated payload that was executed and then deleted to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are several .dll files from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of MpOAV.dll (from Windows Defender) might be a red flag. However, it's possible that Defender is just performing its usual operations. Still, the combination of these image loads with the file deletions and registry changes might indicate a more complex activity.\n\nThe 'File created' and then immediately 'File Delete logged' events for the same file in the Temp directory could be an attempt to execute a script and then remove it. The filename includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which might be a legitimate test, but the presence of 'calc' in the filenames (like 'unidade_temporario_calc.txt') could be a hint. 'Calc' is often used in examples or by attackers as a placeholder. \n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events for PowerShell, which might indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not standard. The repetition of these events could be part of a script that's being run multiple times or is part of a larger attack.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of file deletions in the Temp directory, registry changes, and the use of PowerShell with .NET assemblies might indicate a potential security incident. However, some of these activities could be benign. The confidence level is high enough to flag this as interesting but not certain. The presence of 'decoded.exe' and the deletion of temporary files suggests that there might be an attempt to execute and then remove malicious code. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not overstepping. Legitimate scripts can also create and delete temporary files. But the combination with the registry changes and the specific filenames might be more indicative of something malicious. Therefore, the batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system event logs exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Unusual File Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - **`cmd.exe`** executing commands to delete files like `unidade_temporario_calc.txt` and `tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe` in the Temp directory. The filename `decoded.exe` raises suspicion, as it may indicate the presence of an encoded or obfuscated payload that was executed and later deleted to avoid detection.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity with .NET Assemblies**:\n   - **`powershell.exe`** loading multiple .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) and **Windows Defender's `MpOAV.dll**. While some of these are normal for PowerShell operations, the combination with file creation\/deletion and registry changes may indicate an attempt to execute a script or payload.\n\n3. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in attacks to avoid leaving evidence, though it could also be a legitimate test (e.g., PowerShell script policy checks).\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events. While registry changes are normal, their frequency and lack of context (e.g., no clear purpose) may indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\n5. **Repetitive Lifecycle Events**:\n   - Frequent **`Provider Lifecycle`** and **`Engine Lifecycle`** events for PowerShell. This could suggest the use of PowerShell in a non-standard or automated way (e.g., executing scripts in a loop or through obfuscated code).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Execution and Cleanup**: The deletion of `decoded.exe` and the temporary script file may indicate the execution of a malicious payload followed by cleanup to avoid detection.\n- **Persistence or Evasion**: Registry changes and lifecycle events could be part of an attempt to establish persistence or evade detection by security tools.\n- **Encoded Payloads**: The presence of `.decoded` in filenames and the use of .NET assemblies may hint at obfuscated or encoded malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for additional logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree, user activity) to confirm if the deleted files were part of a larger attack.\n- **Analyze PowerShell Script**: If the `__PSScriptPolicyTest*.ps1` file was created, analyze its contents (if available) for malicious commands.\n- **Check for Exploits**: Investigate if the system was compromised through a vulnerability (e.g., via exploit kits or phishing).\n- **Monitor for Repeated Activity**: Look for similar patterns in the future, as this could be part of an ongoing attack.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe batch of events is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The combination of file deletions in Temp directories, PowerShell activity with .NET assemblies, and registry changes suggests potential malicious behavior. While some actions could be benign (e.g., script testing), the overall pattern aligns with tactics used in malware execution and evasion. **Further analysis is critical** to confirm the threat and mitigate risks. \n\n**Confidence Level**: **High** (75–90% likelihood of malicious activity based on the evidence)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is normal but can also be a red flag if there's suspicious behavior. Let me check each entry.\n\nFirst, there's a Pipe Created event for powershell.exe. Not sure yet. Then, an Engine Lifecycle task. Still normal. The third entry mentions Image loaded with a path to MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be legitimate, but sometimes attackers use similar names.\n\nNext, a File created in the user's AppData folder. Could be a startup script. Then, several Registry value set events. Maybe changing settings, but not necessarily bad. There's also Process accessed events for powershell.exe multiple times. Repeated access could indicate something, but needs more context.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is run several times. That's a standard command to check user context, but if it's being called repeatedly, maybe part of a script. There's also a winlogbeat file created, which is a log shipper. If it's part of a legitimate monitoring setup, that's fine. But if it's unexpected, could be an issue.\n\nOther entries include notepad.exe and calc.exe with ImageLoad events. Urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, so that's probably okay. Svchost.exe has Registry events, which is common for system services.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe activities, some file and registry changes. However, none of the events clearly indicate malicious behavior. The presence of whoami.exe and normal system processes might be part of routine operations. Unless there's a pattern like unexpected command lines or unusual paths, but in this case, the paths seem legitimate. So maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation. But I should check if there's any suspicious command lines. The powershell.exe command line is just \"{}\", which might be a placeholder or part of a script. Not sure. However, without more context or errors, it's hard to say. The confidence is moderate, but leaning towards not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains routine system activity with no clear indicators of compromise. PowerShell and standard utilities like whoami.exe are used in typical operations, and file\/registry events reference legitimate system paths (e.g., Windows Defender, system DLLs). No anomalous command lines or suspicious patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here. The file path seems to be part of a typical installation, but maybe the version number is odd? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are a few ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. Accessing processes isn't necessarily bad, but if it's done repeatedly or without a clear reason, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, there's no additional info like which process is being accessed or what's happening. Maybe it's part of normal operations.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to check user identity, so that's probably benign. The command line looks legitimate, just the executable path.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying registry values. These are usually legitimate processes, but changing registry settings could be part of a malicious activity. However, without more context, like what specific registry keys are being changed, it's hard to tell. Maybe the user was just running some apps that modify the registry.\n\nChrome.exe has several DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries might indicate normal browsing, but if there's a pattern like connecting to suspicious domains, that's a problem. However, the events here don't mention the domains or IPs involved. The network connections could be part of regular internet usage.\n\nPutting it all together: The only potentially suspicious event is the winlogbeat file creation. But winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection. Maybe the user is just installing it. The rest of the events are common system activities. Without more context or anomalies like unexpected network traffic to known malicious IPs, or unauthorized access, there's not enough evidence to flag this as malicious. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes even normal activities can be part of an attack. However, based on the given data, there's no clear indicator of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system activity (e.g., legitimate file creation by winlogbeat, standard process access, benign registry modifications, and typical DNS\/network queries by Chrome).
