{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about updater.exe from Google, which seems legitimate since it's part of Google's crash reporting. But then there's cmdkey.exe listing credentials, which could be normal but might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process accessing another process. Then, a command line in powershell that runs a bunch of commands: net user, get-localuser, listing credentials with cmdkey, looking into user directories, and checking local groups. That's a lot of sensitive information. The user might be trying to gather system details, which is common in reconnaissance phases of an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Security Group Management and User Account Management, which could indicate someone is modifying permissions or user accounts. The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll might be normal, but if those DLLs are from unexpected locations, that's a red flag. However, the paths here are standard Windows system directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThe PowerShell creating a file in the user's AppData and setting a registry value could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the use of net.exe and net1.exe to check local groups might be part of enumerating the network or user privileges.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of legitimate processes and commands that could be part of a malicious activity. The combination of accessing user data, modifying registry, and using PowerShell for various commands suggests potential malicious intent. However, some of these actions could be part of normal administrative tasks. But the frequency of security-related events and the use of PowerShell for enumeration make me lean towards classifying this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing commands to enumerate users\/groups, list credentials via cmdkey, access sensitive files, and modify registry.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not an issue. But then I see a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the command_line for one of the powershell.exe processes: it's running a script that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system's users, groups, and network settings. That's a red flag because such commands can be part of reconnaissance activities by attackers trying to map out the system.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While loading .NET DLLs might be normal, the presence of MpOAV.dll (which is part of Windows Defender) could be a point of interest. However, the more concerning part is the script execution.\n\nAlso, there's a File Created and then immediately File Delete logged events for a temporary PowerShell script. This might be an attempt to execute a script and then clean up traces, which is a common tactic in attacks to avoid detection. \n\nCombining all these points: the PowerShell activity seems to be gathering system information, which is typical in the initial stages of an attack. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file could be an attempt to evade detection. While some of these activities could be benign (like system diagnostics), the combination of these events, especially the use of commands that collect sensitive information, raises suspicion. \n\nI need to check if there's any other context that might make this normal. For example, if this is part of a legitimate script run by administrators, but without more context, the presence of these commands in a PowerShell session is concerning. \n\nSo, the classification here is likely \"INTERESTING\" because the activities indicate potential reconnaissance and possible malicious intent. The confidence is high because the combination of commands and file operations points to suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (net user, get-localgroup, etc.) that gather system information, combined with temporary script file creation\/deletion, suggests potential reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The command lines in the process entries include commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and 'ls C:\\Users' among others. These commands are typically used for enumerating user accounts, groups, and checking stored credentials. That's suspicious because such actions could be part of a reconnaissance phase by an attacker trying to gather information about the system.\n\nThere's also a mention of 'net1.exe' which might be a typo or a malicious variant of 'net.exe', but the command line here is similar to the legitimate 'net user' command. However, the presence of multiple 'net' related commands could indicate someone is trying to map out the network or user accounts.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' by powershell.exe. While creating files isn't inherently malicious, the context here matters. If this file is being created in a user's Downloads folder and the rest of the activities are about enumerating system details, it might be part of a larger attack, like preparing to download more malicious payloads or logging information.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets, but repeated registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying browser behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the powershell activities, it might be part of a broader attack.\n\nThe other entries involve winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file and some image loads, which are normal operations. However, the repeated powershell activities and the use of commands that gather system information are red flags. These are commonly seen in initial access and discovery phases of cyber attacks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows multiple powershell commands that are enumerating system details, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The creation of a text file and the registry changes could be part of the attack's next steps. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these activities is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are executing system enumeration tasks (user\/group discovery, credential listing, file system exploration), which are common in initial access and reconnaissance phases.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a normal activity, maybe part of installing software. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Hmm, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but sometimes malware uses it. However, just loading it isn't necessarily bad. Need to check more.\n\nThen, powershell.exe created a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file might be normal. Unless there's more context, like executing malicious scripts, but here it's just creating a file.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe was run with some command line arguments. The command mentions installsource scheduler, which might be part of a scheduled update. Not sure yet, but could be legitimate.\n\nThen, svchost.exe set registry values twice. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Setting registry values could be part of normal operations, but sometimes malware uses svchost to hide activities. However, without more info, hard to tell.\n\nAnother entry shows MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. Taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler. Again, could be part of legitimate updates, but sometimes attackers use Task Scheduler for persistence. Not sure yet.\n\nBackgroundTaskHost.exe loaded urlmon.dll again. Similar to earlier entries. Still not a red flag on its own.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe created the same .yml.new file again. Maybe a configuration file being written. Could be normal if it's part of the software's setup.\n\nPowerShell.exe set a registry value and had a process access event. Setting registry values through PowerShell could be part of configuration changes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at all these events together, there's a mix of normal activities and some that could be suspicious. The repeated registry changes by svchost and PowerShell might be worth looking into. Also, the use of PowerShell to create files and modify registry could be part of an attack. However, none of the events are clearly malicious on their own. The presence of multiple events involving registry modifications and process creation might indicate something, but without more context like unusual command lines or unexpected network activity, it's hard to be certain. The confidence is moderate, so maybe around 0.6. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. Wait, but the user wants to know if the batch is interesting. The justification should be concise. Maybe the combination of registry changes and file creations could be part of an attack, but without more data, it's not conclusive. So, I might classify it as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve PowerShell and svchost.exe modifying registry values, which could indicate configuration changes or potential persistence mechanisms. Additionally, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file and SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll warrant further investigation for possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
