{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting enough for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry and seeing what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal, right? Browsers often do that. But then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. Hmm, not sure if that's suspicious yet. \n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, so that's a red flag. Next, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but loading it from calc.exe? Maybe not necessarily bad, but I need to check more.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line has schtasks \/create with some tasks named like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command line includes running calc.exe. That seems odd because scheduled tasks usually have more legitimate names. Also, the tasks are set to run on logon and startup, which could be a way to persist. \n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. The file path for one of the tasks is C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon. System32 is a standard directory, but the task name has those weird prefixes like \"pacote_comum_005\". That doesn't look normal. \n\nAlso, svchost.exe is involved in multiple registry changes. While svchost is a normal process, excessive registry modifications could indicate something malicious. \n\nPutting this all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with unusual names, using calc.exe (which is typically a harmless calculator but here might be a red herring), and the use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to set up these tasks. The presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses could be signs of an attacker trying to establish persistence. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there are any obvious signs of malware. The files mentioned like urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll are legitimate. But the way they're being used here, especially through scheduled tasks with strange names, is suspicious. \n\nI think the key points here are the unusual scheduled task names, the use of schtasks to create them, and the repeated registry modifications. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events might indicate an attempt to persist on the system. So, this batch is probably interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names (e.g., 'modulo_principal_005_OnStartup'), use of cmd.exe\/schtasks.exe to execute calc.exe, and unusual registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanisms or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about svchost.exe and chrome.exe doing registry value sets. That's common, but not necessarily bad. However, there's one event where a file was created in the Windows System32 Tasks directory: \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\". That path looks like it could be a startup script, which is often used by malware to persist. \n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe called \"unidade_ativo.txt\" in the user's Downloads folder. That might be benign, but sometimes malware drops files there. However, the name doesn't immediately scream malicious. \n\nAnother point is that chrome.exe is loading some DLLs, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. But if chrome was compromised, maybe it's trying to bypass security features. \n\nThe svchost.exe entries are frequent. While svchost is a normal process, if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't show any clear malicious activity beyond the file creation in the startup folder. \n\nThe presence of a file in the Tasks directory under System32 is concerning because that's a common place for persistence mechanisms. Even if the file is legitimate, the fact that it's being created by svchost.exe might be unusual. \n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The winlogbeat file creation seems normal, as it's part of the monitoring tool. The other events don't show any network activity or unusual process executions. \n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the file created in the startup directory. That's a potential indicator of persistence. However, without more context or additional malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence isn't super high, but it's enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, combined with a suspicious file creation in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (potentially indicating persistence mechanism setup).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, there are a bunch of entries here. The first six lines are all about chrome.exe with the task 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. Then there's a couple of entries about powershell.exe and whoami.exe.\n\nHmm, chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. That's unusual because Chrome typically doesn't need to set registry values frequently. Maybe it's part of normal operations, but repeated entries might indicate something else. But wait, maybe the user is just using Chrome normally, and the logs are capturing legitimate activity. However, the same process doing the same task multiple times could be a sign of persistence mechanisms or malware trying to modify registry keys to maintain access.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed, which is common for legitimate administrative tasks, but can also be used maliciously. The whoami.exe command is often used in attacks to check the current user context. But in this case, the command line shows it's just running whoami.exe normally. However, if it's part of a sequence of commands, that might be suspicious. But here, it's just one event.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, which is not typical, and some process access events. However, without more context like unusual registry keys being modified, or other malicious activities, it's hard to say. The presence of whoami.exe might be benign, but combined with the registry changes, it's possible that this is a red flag. However, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be moderate. The justification would be that the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe could indicate malicious activity, but more data would be needed to confirm. So classification would be INTERESTING with confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes modifying registry values repeatedly, which is unusual for a browser.
