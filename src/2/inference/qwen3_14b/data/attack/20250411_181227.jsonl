{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, which is a common trick in malware to execute arbitrary code. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because it's giving administrative privileges to a scheduled task, which is unusual and could be part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nAlso, there are several entries about the ImageLoad events, which show that PowerShell is loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. This might indicate that the PowerShell script is using .NET framework to perform actions, which can be a sign of obfuscation or advanced techniques to avoid detection. \n\nThe repeated use of Register-ScheduledTask with different task names (unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.) suggests that an attacker is creating multiple scheduled tasks, possibly to persist on the system. The fact that each task is registered with the same structure but different names might be an attempt to evade detection by varying the task names.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, and RegistryEvent entries related to PowerShell could indicate that the process is interacting with the system in ways that are not typical. The combination of these events, especially the scheduled task creation with admin privileges and the loading of .NET assemblies, points towards potential malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these might be legitimate. For example, administrators might create scheduled tasks for maintenance. But the repetition, the use of calc.exe (which is often used in PoC attacks), and the loading of .NET DLLs which are not usually associated with normal PowerShell usage, make me lean towards this being suspicious. \n\nThe key indicators here are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges, the use of calc.exe as the payload, and the loading of .NET assemblies which could be part of a more complex attack. These factors together make this batch of logs worth investigating further for potential security threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit multiple **highly suspicious patterns** indicative of potential **malicious activity**, warranting immediate investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Malicious Scheduled Task Creation**\n- **Repeated Use of `Register-ScheduledTask`**:\n  - Multiple PowerShell commands create scheduled tasks (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`, `tarefa_geral`) with **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** as the owner and **`RunLevel: Highest`**.\n  - **Payload**: Each task executes `calc.exe` (a classic red flag for PoC attacks or obfuscation).\n  - **Implication**: This suggests **privilege escalation** and **persistence mechanisms**. Attackers often use `calc.exe` as a placeholder for more隐蔽 payloads (e.g., downloading malware, executing commands).\n\n---\n\n### **2. .NET Assembly Loading in PowerShell**\n- **ImageLoad Events**:\n  - PowerShell loads .NET assemblies like:\n    - `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscoreei.dll` (part of the .NET runtime).\n    - `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll` (used for JIT compilation).\n  - **Implication**: This is unusual for standard PowerShell usage and may indicate **obfuscation** (e.g., using .NET to execute encoded payloads) or **exploitation of .NET features** to bypass detection.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Anomalous Process and Registry Activity**\n- **Frequent `ProcessCreate`, `ProcessAccess`, and `RegistryEvent` Logs**:\n  - PowerShell interacts with the registry and creates multiple processes, which is atypical for benign scripts.\n  - **Pattern**: Repeated registry writes and process creation could signal **anti-forensics techniques** or **malware persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Lack of Legitimate Context**\n- **No Clear Justification for Actions**:\n  - The tasks and .NET assembly loading lack context (e.g., no legitimate application or user interaction).\n  - **`calc.exe` as a payload** is rarely used in production environments, making it a strong indicator of **malicious intent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs **strongly suggests a security incident** involving:\n- **Scheduled task-based persistence** with administrative privileges.\n- **.NET-based obfuscation** or execution of hidden payloads.\n- **Potential privilege escalation** and **system compromise**.\n\n**Recommended Actions**:\n1. **Isolate the affected system** for forensic analysis.\n2. **Check for additional malicious files** or network connections.\n3. **Audit user accounts** for unauthorized access.\n4. **Monitor for similar activity** on other systems in the network.\n\n**Risk Level**: **High** – Immediate investigation required."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first event shows the loading of a DLL from Windows Defender's path. That might be legitimate, but I should check if there's anything suspicious. Then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to hide its presence. \n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. The command line in one of the entries shows PowerShell being used to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe with high privileges for administrators. That's definitely suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be part of a persistence mechanism. \n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe setting registry values. However, chrome.exe typically doesn't modify the registry, so that might be a red flag. But since there are several entries, maybe it's a legitimate process, but I need to check if there's a pattern. \n\nThe most concerning part is the PowerShell command that sets up a scheduled task. Even though it's using calc.exe, which is a benign application, the method of execution and the use of high privileges could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain access. Also, the fact that the same command is repeated might suggest a script or automated process trying to establish persistence.\n\nThe entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" task are numerous but lack process details. Since the process is None, that might be a log parsing issue or an indicator of something evading detection. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, temporary files being created and deleted, and the registry modifications by chrome.exe could indicate malicious activity. However, some of these could be false positives. The confidence isn't 100%, but there are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing scheduled tasks with high privileges for Administrators, temporary files created and deleted (potential malware cleanup), and repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events (possible lateral movement or command-and-control activity).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but loading DLLs can sometimes be a red flag if it's not expected. However, taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, so maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values isn't unusual, but multiple instances might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Tasks directory named 'unidade_comum'. That path seems a bit odd. 'unidade_comum' translates to 'common unit' in Portuguese, which might be a naming choice, but creating a file in the Tasks directory could be part of a scheduled task setup. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' where the process is None. That might be a log source issue or an indicator of something trying to execute commands without a clear process. But without more info, it's ambiguous.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and some text files in the Downloads folder. Creating files isn't inherently malicious, but if those files are scripts or contain malicious code, that's a problem. However, the logs don't show the content of the files, just their paths.\n\nChrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate DLLs related to Windows Defender and Anti-Malware, so that's normal. But Chrome loading them might be unexpected, but maybe it's part of some extension or legitimate process.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal during setup or updates. However, the presence of 'winlogbeat' in the logs might be a red herring if it's just part of the system's monitoring.\n\nThe repetition of chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times might be normal if it's part of an extension or update. However, repeated registry changes could be a sign of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe DNS query from chrome.exe is normal for browsing, but if it's querying suspicious domains, that's a problem. The logs don't specify the domain, though.\n\nOverall, there are some suspicious elements like the file in the Tasks directory, the remote command execution without a process, and repeated registry changes. However, many of these could be legitimate activities. Without more context or indicators of compromise (like unusual network traffic, unexpected processes, or file contents), it's hard to confirm malicious activity. The logs might be normal system behavior, but the presence of certain entries warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs contain a mix of legitimate system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **WmiPrvSE.exe Loading `taskschd.dll`**  \n   - **Context**: `taskschd.dll` is part of the Windows Task Scheduler. `WmiPrvSE.exe` (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a legitimate process.  \n   - **Verdict**: Normal system behavior.\n\n2. **Chrome.exe Loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`**  \n   - **Context**: These DLLs are part of Windows Defender (Anti-Malware Service Executable). Chrome may load them for security checks or extension interactions.  \n   - **Verdict**: Likely benign.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat.exe Creating `.yml.new` File**  \n   - **Context**: Winlogbeat is a log shipper. Creating a configuration file (`.yml.new`) is typical during setup or updates.  \n   - **Verdict**: Normal operational activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **`svchost.exe` Setting Registry Values Repeatedly**  \n   - **Context**: While registry modifications by `svchost.exe` are common, **repeated changes** (especially without clear purpose) could indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **malware attempting to modify system behavior**.  \n   - **Verdict**: Requires further investigation (e.g., check registry keys modified).\n\n2. **File Created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_principal.txt`**  \n   - **Context**: The file name (`entrada_principal.txt`) is generic, but its creation via PowerShell could be **part of data exfiltration** or **malicious script execution**.  \n   - **Verdict**: Monitor file contents and origin.\n\n3. **`Execute a Remote Command` with `Process: None`**  \n   - **Context**: This may indicate **log parsing errors** or **malicious activity attempting to execute commands without a clear process** (e.g., via PowerShell or WMI).  \n   - **Verdict**: High risk. Investigate for potential command-line injection or WMI exploitation.\n\n4. **Multiple `chrome.exe` Registry Modifications**  \n   - **Context**: While Chrome may modify the registry for extensions, **repeated changes** could signal **malware attempting to persist** or **tamper with browser behavior**.  \n   - **Verdict**: Investigate registry keys modified by Chrome.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Check File Contents**  \n   - Inspect files like `entrada_principal.txt` and `objeto_auxiliar.txt` for malicious payloads or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Analyze Registry Changes**  \n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Registry Editor** to track modifications by `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`.\n\n3. **Investigate `Execute a Remote Command` Events**  \n   - Check for associated network traffic (e.g., DNS queries to suspicious domains) or command-line arguments.\n\n4. **Monitor Winlogbeat Configuration**  \n   - Ensure `.yml.new` files are legitimate and not tampered with.\n\n5. **Check for Unusual PowerShell Activity**  \n   - Review PowerShell logs for script execution, remote command calls, or unexpected file operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is legitimate, **multiple red flags** (e.g., repeated registry changes, suspicious file creation, and unexplained remote command execution) suggest **potential compromise**. Further investigation using forensic tools and network monitoring is recommended."}
