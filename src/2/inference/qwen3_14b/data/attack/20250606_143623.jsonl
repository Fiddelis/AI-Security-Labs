The BinaryPathName points to a file in C:\\unidade_logico... which seems suspicious. Creating a new service and starting it could be part of a malicious payload. Also, the service name is \"objeto_ativo\" which might be a red herring, but the path doesn't look standard.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender.

That could be modifying service configurations, which is a common technique for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: The events show PowerShell being used to create a new service, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting a temporary file, and modifying registry entries. The creation of a new service with a non-standard path is a red flag. Also, the repeated registry modifications by services.exe might indicate an attempt to alter system behavior. The combination of these actions suggests potential malicious activity, like establishing persistence or executing a payload.

That's normal, as services.exe is part of Windows and handles service configurations. But then there's tarefa_logico.exe loading several DLLs from the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are standard .NET components, so loading them might be normal if the application is a .NET app. However, tarefa_logico.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a legitimate application, but I should check if there's any suspicious behavior.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for PowerShell profiles, but the name \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\" might be normal. However, the same powershell.exe also sets a registry value. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of services.exe and svchost.exe setting registry values. These are typically normal system processes, but repeated entries could indicate something if they're modifying critical registry keys. However, without more context, it's hard to say.

If this process is part of a legitimate application, it's okay. But if it's an unknown or suspicious process, loading those DLLs could be part of a malicious payload.

So first, I'll go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the entries are about svchost.exe and services.exe doing registry operations like setting values or adding\/deleting objects. That's normal for system processes, right? But then there's setup.exe involved. Setup.exe is usually part of installation processes. The logs show setup.exe creating files like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe in the Program Files directory, which is where software typically installs. Also, there are shortcuts created in the Start Menu and Quick Launch. \n\nWait, but why is setup.exe creating these files? If it's part of a legitimate installation, that's okay. But if it's a malicious setup, that's a problem. However, the logs don't mention any unusual behavior beyond the file creation. The file paths look legitimate, like Microsoft Edge components. Maybe this is a normal installation of Edge. But then why are there so many registry changes? Maybe the setup process is modifying the registry as part of installation. \n\nBut the classification needs to be based on whether the batch is interesting for investigation. If all these events are part of a legitimate software install, then it's not interesting. However, if there's something suspicious, like unexpected file creation or unusual registry changes, then it might be interesting. \n\nLooking again, the setup.exe is creating files in standard locations, and the processes involved are common. There's no mention of network activity, privilege escalation, or other red flags. The registry changes are part of the setup process. So maybe this is just a normal installation of Microsoft Edge. Therefore, the events might not be interesting. However, the high number of registry events and file creations could be a sign of something. But without more context, like if the setup.exe is from an unknown source, it's hard to tell. Since the user hasn't provided info on the source of setup.exe, maybe it's safer to assume it's legitimate. \n\nBut the presence of setup.exe creating multiple files and registry changes might still be worth investigating, especially if it's not part of a known installation. But given the file paths are for Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate application, maybe it's okay. Hmm. The confidence here is a bit low. Maybe 0.5? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the system is supposed to have Edge installed and this is a normal update, then it's not interesting. But if it's unexpected, maybe it's interesting. Since the user hasn't provided context, the justification would be that it's related to a software installation, which is normal, but the high volume of events might be worth checking.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first 12 entries, they're all about svchost.exe performing registry value sets. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, repeated registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern. But on their own, they might not be a red flag. Maybe a legitimate application is modifying the registry, but it's not unusual for svchost to do that.\n\nThen, starting from the 13th entry, there's setup.exe creating multiple files in the Program Files (x86) directory under Microsoft EdgeCore. The files include msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others. Setup.exe is typically a legitimate installer, so creating these files might be part of a normal installation process. However, the presence of multiple files in a specific directory could indicate an installation, but again, that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nWait, but there's also an entry where setup.exe loads taskschd.dll from the System32 directory. That's a legitimate DLL used by Task Scheduler, so that's normal. However, the key point here is that setup.exe is creating a lot of files, which might be part of a software installation. But if this is part of a known good software like Microsoft Edge, then it's okay. However, if the setup.exe is not from a trusted source, that's a problem. But the logs don't mention the source or any anomalies in the process.\n\nBut looking at the file paths, the EdgeCore directory and the versions (like 137.0.3296.62) might be specific to a particular version of Edge. If this is a legitimate update or installation, then it's not suspicious. However, the repetition of registry changes by svchost.exe could be a sign of something else. But svchost is a host process, so multiple instances modifying the registry could be part of normal operations.\n\nWait, but the justification for classification needs to be based on the combination of events. The presence of setup.exe creating multiple files in a Program Files directory, along with registry changes by svchost.exe, might be part of a normal installation. However, if setup.exe is not expected in that context, or if the files created are not part of a known legitimate software, that's a concern. But in this case, the files are related to Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate application. The setup.exe could be part of an Edge installer.\n\nHowever, the confidence level here might be low because without additional context, such as the source of setup.exe or any other anomalies, it's hard to determine if this is malicious. The logs don't show any obvious signs of compromise, like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access. The events seem to be related to a software installation, which is a normal process. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. But I need to be careful here. If the setup.exe is not from a trusted source, but the logs don't indicate that. So, based solely on the given data, it's more likely a legitimate installation, hence not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be related to a legitimate software installation (Microsoft Edge components) and standard system operations (svchost.exe registry modifications).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event is about PowerShell loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems a bit odd because Defender's files are usually trusted, but maybe it's a legitimate process. Then there's a command line using DISM to disable Windows Defender. That's suspicious because disabling Defender could be part of an attack. \n\nNext, there are multiple entries where Dism.exe is creating or accessing various DLLs in the Temp folder. The fact that so many executable files are being created in the Temp directory might indicate something malicious. Typically, Temp folders are used for temporary files, but generating multiple executables there could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the command line arguments for DISM are disabling a feature, which might be part of an attempt to remove security software. The combination of disabling Defender and creating numerous executable files in the Temp directory suggests that this might be part of a larger attack. The presence of multiple File Executable Detected events for files in the Temp folder adds to the suspicion. \n\nI should check if these are all legitimate. Maybe the user is doing some system maintenance, but the volume of events and the specific actions (disabling Defender) make me think this is more likely malicious.

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to 'setup.exe' performing registry operations. There are multiple entries where 'setup.exe' is setting registry values and even deleting or adding registry objects. That's a lot of activity. Now, registry changes can be normal, especially during installations, but when they're repeated so many times, that might be a red flag. Malware often modifies the registry to persist or hide its presence.\n\nThen there are some Pipe Created events. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, but again, if there's a lot of pipe creation, especially by the same process, that could indicate something malicious. However, I need to check if that's normal for setup.exe. Maybe not, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNow, looking further down, there are several 'svchost.exe' processes creating files in the Windows Temp directory with names like APPX followed by random strings. APPX is related to Windows Store apps, but the fact that svchost.exe is creating so many of these files in Temp might be suspicious. Typically, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, but if it's creating a lot of temporary files, that could be part of a malicious activity, like downloading or installing something without user consent.\n\nAnother thing is the file path 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\AppReadiness\\\\S-1-5-18' being created by svchost.exe. AppReadiness is a system component that prepares the system for new installations, but the presence of a file in that directory might be part of a legitimate process. However, combined with the other events, it could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting this all together: 'setup.exe' doing a lot of registry changes, which might be part of an installation, but the high number of events and the involvement of svchost.exe creating multiple files in Temp could indicate a potential attack. The combination of registry modifications and unexpected file creation by system processes is concerning. However, I need to check if there's a known legitimate reason for this. But since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to go with the logs.\n\nThe confidence level here is medium to high. The repetition of events and the involvement of system processes in unusual activities are indicators of possible malicious behavior. However, without more context, it's not certain.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the specific events.\n\nThe first event mentions the loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory. That's a legitimate file, so maybe not a problem. But then there's a file created in the Windows Temp directory with a .dpa.psm1 extension. That's a PowerShell module file, but creating such files in Temp could be suspicious if it's part of a script that's not authorized.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's part of PowerShell's startup profiles, which might be normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process executing a command that checks INF files for defaultinstall sections. The command line is a bit complex. It's looking for specific patterns in INF files, which might be part of a script that's trying to detect if certain drivers or components are installed. But why would that be suspicious? Maybe if it's part of a larger attack, like checking for vulnerabilities or preparing for exploitation. However, on its own, this might not be enough.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoaded events for .NET Framework DLLs and Windows Defender DLLs. Those are legitimate, so they might just be part of normal PowerShell operations. However, the repetition of loading the same DLLs could be a red flag if it's unexpected, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of a whoami.exe process is normal; it's just a utility to get user information. So that's likely benign.\n\nNow, considering all the events, the main points are the file creations in Temp and the specific PowerShell command. The command is scanning INF files for certain sections. That might be part of a legitimate script, but in some cases, attackers might use similar techniques to find vulnerabilities or check for system configurations that could be exploited. However, without additional events like network connections to suspicious IPs, execution of malicious code, or access to sensitive files, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nThe justification would be that while there are some suspicious activities like file creation in Temp and the specific PowerShell command, they might not be enough on their own to confirm a threat.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by svchost.exe. The first entry is a file created in the WindowsApps directory for EdgeGameAssist.exe. Then there are multiple entries for files in the AppReadiness folder under Windows, with paths that look like security identifiers (SIDs). Those SIDs are typically used for user or group accounts, so having files named after SIDs in AppReadiness might be suspicious. I remember that the AppReadiness folder is used by Windows for application readiness checks, but creating files there, especially with such paths, could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if there are multiple entries, that might indicate something is trying to modify the registry. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, so it's possible that these are normal operations. But when combined with the file creations, it might be more concerning.\n\nThen there's a RuntimeBroker.exe process modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is associated with UWP apps and can be legitimate, but again, multiple registry changes might be worth looking into.\n\nThe PowerShell events are interesting. One of them runs a command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. That seems benign, but the other entries show image loads of .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and System.Management.Automation.ni.dll. These are standard .NET components, so loading them is normal for PowerShell scripts. However, the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that a script is running that's using .NET, which could be part of a larger operation.\n\nPutting this all together: the svchost.exe creating files in AppReadiness with SID-like names is unusual. The repeated registry changes by svchost and RuntimeBroker could be part of a larger attack, maybe trying to persist or modify system settings. The PowerShell activity seems normal, but the combination of these events might suggest that there's some malicious activity going on, especially if the files in AppReadiness are not part of a legitimate installation.\n\nHowever, there's not enough information to confirm that these are malicious. For example, the EdgeGameAssist.exe might be a legitimate component of Microsoft Edge. The repeated file creations in AppReadiness could be part of a system update or some other legitimate process. The registry changes might be part of normal service operations. Without more context, like the presence of other suspicious activities or known bad indicators, it's hard to be certain.\n\nBut given that there are multiple unusual file creations and registry changes by system processes, even if they are legitimate, the combination might still be worth investigating.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple files are being detected by Dism.exe. The filenames are things like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, and others. These are all DLL files in the Temp directory. Now, Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging, but the fact that it's loading a bunch of DLLs from the Temp folder might be suspicious. Usually, legitimate DLLs used by Dism would be in system directories, not in Temp. Also, the Temp directory is a common place for malware to store temporary files.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where DismHost.exe is created with a command line that includes a GUID. That GUID might be part of a malicious payload or a unique identifier for an attack. Also, several ImageLoad events show that DismHost.exe is loading various DLLs from the same Temp directory. These DLLs include names like DismCorePS.dll, DismProv.dll, and others. While some of these might be legitimate, the fact that they're all in the Temp folder and loaded by a process that's typically associated with system imaging could indicate something's wrong.\n\nI should also check if there's any pattern here. The same GUID appears in the command line, which might be a red flag. Additionally, the presence of multiple DLLs being loaded from the same directory by different processes could suggest that an attacker is trying to execute code through these files. The Temp directory is often used by malware because it's temporary and might not be scanned as thoroughly.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Dism.exe and DismHost.exe are legitimate, but their usage here might be out of context. If these DLLs are part of a legitimate installation or update process, then it's not malicious. But given that they're in the Temp folder and the lack of other context (like user interaction or known legitimate processes), this could be a sign of a compromise.\n\nConsidering all this, the combination of multiple DLLs from Temp being loaded by Dism-related processes, along with the GUID in the command line, points towards a potential security incident.

The task mentioned is \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. Each entry has a file path in the Temp directory, specifically under a unique GUID folder, with various .mui files.\n\nHmm, .mui files are typically language-specific resource files for Windows, used for localization. They are usually part of the system's language packs. However, the fact that these files are being detected as executable by the rule might be a red flag. Wait, but the rule name is \"FileExecutableDetected,\" which might be a custom rule or part of a specific security software. \n\nThe paths are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files. However, if these files are being created in a Temp folder with a GUID that seems random, that could be a sign of something malicious trying to hide. But Dism.exe is a legitimate process, and during operations like image deployment, it might generate temporary files. \n\nBut wait, the files are .mui files. Are these supposed to be executable? Typically, .mui files are not executables but resource files. If the security system is flagging them as executable, maybe there's a misconfiguration in the rule. Alternatively, maybe the files are being used in a way that's not standard. \n\nLooking at the number of files—there are 15 entries, all with similar paths but different provider names. This could be part of a normal operation where Dism.exe is processing multiple components, each with their own provider DLLs. However, the repetition of the same GUID suggests that all these files are part of the same session or operation, which might be normal. \n\nBut the classification here depends on whether this is a legitimate activity or not.

If this is part of a legitimate system update or deployment, then it's normal. However, if this is part of a malicious activity, the GUID might be used to obfuscate the activity. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe classification depends on whether these events are part of normal operations or not. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, and the files are in the Temp directory, it's possible that this is a normal operation. However, the fact that multiple files are being detected as executables might be a sign of something unusual. But given that the process is legitimate, and the files are in the Temp folder, it's possible that this is not malicious. However, the presence of multiple provider DLLs might be a red flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the detection rule is too broad. The rule FileExecutableDetected might be flagging any executable file, but in this case, the files are DLLs. However, DLLs can be executed if they have the correct headers. But that's not typical. So, if the system is detecting DLLs as executables, that could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nBut again, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The key factors here are the process (Dism.exe), the location (Temp), and the files being DLLs. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate process that can interact with these types of files, and the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, this might be a normal event. However, the number of files being detected might be higher than usual, which could indicate something is wrong.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because while Dism.exe is legitimate, the large number of DLLs being detected in the Temp directory might indicate an unusual activity that warrants further investigation. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's enough to be cautious but not conclusive evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DLL files in the Temp directory are being flagged by Dism.exe, which is typically used for Windows imaging.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to analyze these log entries to see if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where DismHost.exe is loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The files have names like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. Then, there's an event where DismHost.exe terminates. After that, Dism.exe is deleting some of those DLL files that were previously loaded.\n\nHmm. DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool, which is used for Windows image management. Typically, DISM is used by administrators for tasks like applying updates or configuring images. However, loading a bunch of DLLs from a temporary directory might be normal during its operations, especially if it's processing an image. But the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded could be a sign of something, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nWait, but then Dism.exe is deleting those DLLs. That could be part of the normal cleanup process. However, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs and then delete them to avoid leaving traces. But in this case, the DLLs are named after providers, which might be part of DISM's own components. For example, AppxProvider.dll or SysprepProvider.dll could be legitimate parts of the system.\n\nBut why are they being loaded from the Temp directory? That's a common place for temporary files, but if the files are being loaded from there, it's possible that they were placed there by another process. However, if DismHost.exe is the one that placed them there, then it's part of its normal operation.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any signs of unusual behavior? The events don't mention any errors or failed operations. All the tasks are \"Image loaded\" and \"Process terminated,\" which are normal events. The deletion by Dism.exe might be part of the process after the image has been processed.\n\nBut wait, maybe the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from the same temporary directory is suspicious. However, DISM might require multiple providers during its operations. For example, during a Windows image deployment, various providers might be needed. So this could be normal.\n\nAlternatively, if these DLLs were not supposed to be there, or if they were injected by a malicious process, that would be a problem. But the logs don't show any other processes involved except DismHost.exe and Dism.exe. The user is fiddelis, which might be a username, but that's not necessarily indicative of malicious activity.\n\nI should check if the DLLs mentioned are known to be part of DISM. For example, looking up some of these names: IntlProvider.dll is related to international settings, which is part of DISM's functionality. Similarly, SysprepProvider.dll is used during sysprep, which is part of Windows deployment. So these could be legitimate.\n\nHowever, the fact that they are being loaded from the Temp directory might be a red flag. Typically, system components are not loaded from Temp, which is a temporary storage area. But if DISM is running a command that requires these providers, it might extract them temporarily. For example, when using DISM to apply an image, it might extract necessary files into the Temp directory.\n\nThe deletion of the DLLs by Dism.exe after the process is done could be part of the cleanup. But if the deletion is happening immediately after the process terminates, that might be normal. However, if the deletion is done by a different process, that could be suspicious. But here, it's Dism.exe, which is related.\n\nPutting it all together: these events might be part of a legitimate DISM operation where the host process loads various providers from the Temp directory, then deletes them after use. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are loaded from Temp could be a sign of something unusual, but without additional context, it's hard to say. Since the events don't show any clear signs of malicious activity (like unexpected processes, network activity, or errors), but the location of the DLLs is a bit suspicious, I might classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence. However, if DISM is known to use Temp for such operations, then it's not interesting. But without knowing that, the presence of multiple DLLs from Temp loaded by a system process might be worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DLLs are loaded from a temporary directory by DismHost.exe, which is unusual for system processes.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are from the Dism.exe process, which I know is part of the Windows Deployment Services. The task logged is \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\" each time. The files being deleted are all .mui files located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path.\n\nHmm, .mui files are usually language-specific resource files. But why is Dism.exe deleting so many of them? I recall that Dism is used for imaging and deployment, so maybe during a deployment process, it's cleaning up temporary files. However, the sheer number of deletions here seems high. Also, the Temp directory is a common place for malware to store temporary files, but in this case, the process is legitimate.\n\nWait, but if this is part of a normal deployment, the system should handle it. However, if these deletions are happening outside of a typical deployment scenario, it might be suspicious. The same GUID path for all files suggests they might be part of a single operation. But since Dism is a legitimate tool, unless there's a known exploit or malicious use of Dism, this might just be normal activity.\n\nBut the classification is about whether it's interesting for investigation. Even though Dism is legitimate, multiple deletions of .mui files could be part of a larger attack, like cleaning up after an exploit.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The events mention file deletions and a file creation time change in the Temp directory under a specific user's AppData folder.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple files are being deleted, including DLLs and MUI files. The paths all point to a temporary directory with a unique GUID, which is common for temporary files. However, the fact that so many files are being deleted by Dism.exe might be unusual. Normally, Dism.exe is used for system image operations, not for deleting a large number of files, especially in the Temp folder.\n\nBut wait, the user might be running a legitimate system cleanup or deployment task. However, the combination of multiple deletions and a file creation time change could indicate tampering. The creation time change might be an attempt to alter timestamps to hide malicious activity. However, since all events are logged by the FileDeleteDetected rule, which is a standard monitoring rule, it's possible that this is just a normal operation.\n\nOn the other hand, the high number of deletions and the specific files being deleted might be part of a larger malicious activity. For example, if an attacker is using Dism.exe to delete files as part of a persistence mechanism or to cover their tracks. However, without additional context like other processes or network activity, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering that all events are from a single process and the files are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files, it's possible that this is a legitimate activity. However, the high number of deletions and the change in creation time might still be suspicious. I need to weigh the likelihood of this being a false positive versus a genuine threat.\n\nSince the user is asking for classification based on the entire batch, and given that the events are all related to Dism.exe deleting files in a temporary directory, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because Dism.exe is a legitimate process and Temp files are often cleaned up. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because the volume of deletions could be unusual.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one stands out because it's using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable in a directory that seems suspicious: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating a new service and starting it could be a sign of something malicious, especially if the binary is in an unusual location.\n\nThe rest of the events are all PowerShell commands with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The commands are mostly benign, like writing a host message or checking INF files for certain patterns. However, the repetition of the same command multiple times might be a red flag. But in this case, the commands themselves don't seem to be doing anything harmful. \n\nThe key point here is the first event. Creating a service and executing a binary from a non-standard path is a common tactic used by malware to persist on a system.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all from the Dism.exe process, each logging a file delete event. The files being deleted are all DLLs located in the same temporary directory under the user's AppData. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what Dism.exe is. DISM is a Windows tool used for imaging and deployment, often used in system preparation tasks. It's common during processes like sysprep or image deployment. So, normally, DISM might delete temporary files after deployment, which could explain some of these deletions.\n\nHowever, the key here is the number of files being deleted. There are 16 entries here, all from the same process and same directory. That's a lot of files. Typically, during a normal DISM operation, you might see some files being deleted, but 16 different DLLs in a temporary folder might be unusual. Also, the names of the DLLs like \"FfuProvider.dll\", \"FolderProvider.dll\", etc., seem to be specific to certain deployment scenarios. \n\nBut wait, if this is part of a legitimate deployment, maybe these are temporary files generated during the process. However, the fact that all these deletions are logged by the same process and in the same directory might indicate that something is going on. The presence of multiple provider DLLs could be part of a larger deployment or imaging process, but the high number might be a red flag. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the user context. The files are in the user's AppData, which might be a temporary location. However, if this is part of a system-wide deployment, maybe it's supposed to be there. But since the user is \"fiddelis,\" unless that's an admin account, maybe there's a lack of proper permissions. However, the logs don't mention user account details beyond the path.\n\nAlso, the rule triggering these logs is \"FileDeleteDetected,\" which is a standard rule for detecting file deletions. The fact that so many files are being deleted by DISM might be normal in some contexts, but could also be a sign of a malicious process if DISM is being used to clean up after an attack. However, without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut considering that all events are from DISM and the same directory, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate system deployment or imaging process. However, the high number of deletions might be unusual. The confidence here is a bit tricky. If I had more data, like process creation events or network activity, I could cross-reference. But based solely on these logs, it's a mix of normal and possibly suspicious. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the volume of deletions by a single process in a temporary directory could indicate either a legitimate but large deployment or something malicious. The justification is the multiple file deletions by DISM in a temporary folder, which could be part of a normal process but also might be suspicious if not expected. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's not enough information to be certain, but the pattern is notable.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletions by Dism.exe in a temporary directory, which may indicate legitimate deployment activity or potential malicious behavior if unexpected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them to see if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first two events, they both have the same process command line. The command line uses PowerShell with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The script is checking INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns related to different architectures (amd64, arm, etc.). The purpose seems to be scanning for defaultinstall sections in INF files, which might be part of driver installation or system configuration. But why would someone do this? Maybe looking for signs of malicious activity, like rogue drivers or unauthorized installations. However, the script itself isn't obviously malicious. It's just reading files and checking for certain strings.\n\nThe other events are less suspicious. One is about Security Group Management, another is services.exe during logon, and another is a Special Logon. These are normal system activities. The key here is the first two events. The repetition of the same command line might indicate that the process is being run multiple times, perhaps as part of a scan or monitoring. However, the script's behavior isn't inherently malicious. It's possible that this is a legitimate check, but the fact that it's being run under Restricted ExecutionPolicy might be a red flag. Wait, Restricted is actually a more secure policy, so maybe that's not a problem. Alternatively, the script could be part of a larger malicious payload, but based on the given data, there's no direct evidence of that.\n\nThe justification would be that the repeated PowerShell script scanning INF files could be part of a legitimate system check, but the repetition and the specific patterns might warrant further investigation. However, without additional context like network activity, file changes, or other anomalous behavior, it's not conclusive. The confidence is moderate because while the events are not obviously malicious, they are unusual enough to merit closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repeated PowerShell activity scanning INF files for architecture-specific installation sections may indicate system enumeration or driver-related activity, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, mostly from Windows Event Logs, and they want me to analyze them. The main goal is probably to detect any suspicious activity or potential security threats.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the log entries one by one. The first few entries are about processes like services.exe, sppsvc.exe, and svchost.exe with tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, and Image loaded. These are normal system processes, so they might not be a concern. However, I should note that svchost.exe is often used by malware to hide, so it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThen there are a bunch of entries where the process is None, and the task is also None or Windows Update Agent. These might be incomplete logs or from different sources, but they don't seem immediately suspicious.\n\nThe critical part comes later. There are multiple entries with the same command_line for powershell.exe. The command is using New-Service and Start-Service to create and start a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". \n\nNow, \"objeto_ativo\" translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese, which is a bit generic, but the path itself is unusual. The directories like \"unidade_logico\" (logical unit) and \"registro_comum\" (common register) might be part of a custom setup, but the presence of a new service created via PowerShell could be a red flag. Typically, creating a new service with a custom executable isn't standard unless it's part of a legitimate installation. However, since the user hasn't mentioned any such installation, this might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the repeated entries of the same command suggest that this might be part of a script or automated process. The fact that the service is being created and started immediately could indicate an attempt to persist on the system. The executable's location is in a non-standard directory, which is another red flag because legitimate services are usually in system directories like C:\\Program Files or C:\\Windows\\System32.\n\nI should check if the executable \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is known malware. However, without access to external databases, I can't confirm that. But the name \"tarefa_logico\" translates to \"logical task,\" which is vague and could be a placeholder for malicious code.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of PowerShell with the & { ... } syntax, which is common in scripts. This might be part of a larger attack chain, such as initial access, execution, or persistence.\n\nIn summary, the main suspicious activity is the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable path using PowerShell. This could be a sign of a potential security threat, such as a backdoor or malware attempting to establish persistence on the system. The user should investigate the executable's legitimacy, check for any unauthorized services, and review the system for other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a potential security threat, primarily due to the creation of a suspicious service using PowerShell. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - **Command**: \n     ```powershell\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"; Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - **Service Name**: `objeto_ativo` (translated as \"active object\").\n   - **Binary Path**: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` (non-standard, custom directory structure).\n\n2. **Red Flags**:\n   - **Non-Standard Path**: The executable is located in a directory (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`) that is not typical for legitimate system services. Legitimate services usually reside in `C:\\Program Files` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n   - **Repetition**: The same command is logged multiple times, suggesting automation or a script.\n   - **Service Persistence**: Creating and starting a new service via PowerShell is often associated with malware attempting to establish persistence on the system.\n\n3. **Potential Malware Indicators**:\n   - The executable name `tarefa_logico.exe` (translated as \"logical task\") is vague and could be a placeholder for malicious code.\n   - The absence of prior logs for this service or executable may indicate a new, unauthorized installation.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Executable**:\n   - Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe` using tools like VirusTotal, malware analysis platforms, or static\/dynamic analysis to confirm its legitimacy.\n   - Check if the file is signed by a trusted certificate and verify its digital signature.\n\n2. **Review System Services**:\n   - Use `sc query` or the Services Manager (`services.msc`) to inspect the newly created service (`objeto_ativo`).\n   - Confirm if the service is expected and if its configuration matches legitimate system services.\n\n3. **Audit PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Review PowerShell logs for other suspicious commands or scripts executed recently.\n   - Check for elevation of privileges or access to sensitive directories.\n\n4. **Network and Host Monitoring**:\n   - Monitor network traffic from `tarefa_logico.exe` for unusual outbound connections (e.g., to C2 servers).\n   - Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect anomalous behavior.\n\n5. **Containment and Removal**:\n   - If confirmed malicious, delete the service and executable immediately.\n   - Reboot the system and ensure no residual malicious files remain.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe creation of the `objeto_ativo` service with a non-standard executable path is a high-risk event. This behavior is commonly associated with malware attempting to persist on the system. Immediate investigation and mitigation are critical to prevent further compromise."}
