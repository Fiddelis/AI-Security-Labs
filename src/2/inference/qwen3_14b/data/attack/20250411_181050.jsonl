{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, browsers often make DNS requests. Not a red flag here.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is executed. That's a standard command to get user info, but it's not inherently malicious. However, if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and process access. PowerShell is common, but when combined with other activities, it could be a concern. The next entry is winlogbeat creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the path is in the Downloads folder. Maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses certutil to encode and decode files. Certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding, but in this case, the command line is using it to encode calc.exe (a legitimate Windows calculator) into a temp file, then decode another file. Wait, but the command line has some odd parts. The use of certutil with encode and decode might be part of a data exfiltration or something else. Also, the filenames have some non-English characters, which could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. The file paths have names like \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" which seems odd. Also, the File Executable Detected event for a temp file might indicate that an executable was created, which is unusual in Temp folders.\n\nAnother point is the use of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll. That's part of the Windows Update process, but if it's being used in an unexpected way, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, the command line here seems legitimate.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These are system DLLs, so loading them is normal. However, if SDXHelper is not a known legitimate process, that could be a concern. But the logs don't indicate that SDXHelper is malicious here.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious parts are the certutil commands encoding and decoding files, creating executables in the Temp directory, and the use of cmd.exe with certutil. These could be signs of data exfiltration, payload decoding, or other malicious activities. The presence of multiple certutil events and the creation of files with strange names in the Temp folder are red flags. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and whoami.exe are normal, the combination of these events suggests potential malicious behavior. However, without more context, it's not definitive, but enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple certutil.exe processes decoding\/encoding files in temporary directories, combined with suspicious file creation events and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are from chrome.exe with network connections and registry changes. That's common, maybe normal browsing activity. But then there's one event from powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder called componente_auxiliar.txt. That's a bit unusual. Why would PowerShell create a file like that? Maybe it's part of a script or user activity, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, there's SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL used for URL monikers, but if it's being loaded by an unexpected process, that could be a red flag. However, SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate process. Hmm, need to check if that's a known good process. But the user hasn't provided context on that, so I can't be sure. However, the fact that it's loading a system DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file makes sense if it's being set up. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which might be less secure. However, if the user is installing or configuring Winlogbeat manually, that's normal.\n\nOther events include PowerShell accessing processes and setting registry values. Again, this could be part of normal user activities or scripts. But the repetition of events from chrome.exe might indicate normal operations, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the only potentially suspicious event is the creation of componente_auxiliar.txt by PowerShell. But without more context, like the content of the file or other related events, it's hard to say. The rest are either normal or not clearly malicious. However, since there's at least one event that's slightly out of the ordinary, maybe it's worth looking into. But the confidence isn't very high because there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity. So the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes show network connections and registry modifications, which could indicate normal activity. However, powershell.exe created a file in the Downloads directory (componente_auxiliar.txt), which may suggest user-initiated actions or potential malicious behavior. The presence of SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll is neutral, but the combination of events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
