{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through this step by step. The user provided a series of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the processes involved. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is common but can be a red flag if used maliciously. Then there's chrome.exe and whoami.exe. The whoami.exe is normal, but the chrome.exe entries are mostly about registry changes. \n\nLooking at the first event, there's a file created by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt'. That's a temporary file, but creating a file isn't necessarily bad. However, the next events show multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe. That's unusual because chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much. \n\nThen, there's a process created with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The script's name suggests it might be capturing keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. The log path is set to $env:TEMP\\key.log, which is a common place for malware to store data. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate .NET components, but the repeated loading might indicate something's wrong. \n\nThe command lines for the powershell processes are similar, all invoking Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from different paths. This could be an attempt to obfuscate the source, but the script's purpose is clear. \n\nPutting this together, the key points are the keystroke logging script, multiple registry changes by chrome.exe (which is odd), and the unusual .NET image loads. Even though some entries are normal, the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because keystroke loggers are typically malicious, and the other events support that suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in TEMP directory, combined with unusual registry modifications by Chrome and .NET assembly loads, suggests potential keystroke logging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries involving powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. But what's catching my eye here is the command lines. For example, the first event has a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. The same script is mentioned in other events with different paths. \n\nWait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is typically associated with keyloggers. That's definitely a red flag. Keyloggers are used to steal sensitive information, so this is suspicious. Also, the fact that the same script is being executed multiple times from different directories might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing paths each time.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation and deletion events. There's a file created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That could be part of a technique to leave no traces, which is common in malware. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files might be normal if it's part of log shipping, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it's worth noting.\n\nThe events also include loading of DLLs from Windows Defender, which might be normal, but the combination with the other events is concerning. The repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths suggests a pattern, not just a one-off incident. \n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The process 'None' in one event with a remote command execution task might be a sign of something like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited. However, the justification for that event is unclear without more context. \n\nPutting it all together, the repeated execution of a keystroke logging script from various locations, along with file creation and deletion in temporary directories, points towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be benign, the combination here is strong enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence level is high because the presence of a keylogger script is a clear indicator of possible compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directories, a common technique for keylogging.
