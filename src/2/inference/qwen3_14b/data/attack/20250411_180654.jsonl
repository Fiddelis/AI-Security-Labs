{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Let me check the specific events. \n\nThe first event is a file creation by PowerShell: 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the Downloads folder. Not suspicious on its own, but maybe part of something else. Then there are several ProcessAccess and Registry value set events for Chrome.exe. Chrome doing registry changes might be normal, but repeated entries could indicate something. However, the same event repeated multiple times might be a red flag. \n\nThen there's a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. But the command line is straightforward, so not suspicious. \n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell process with a command line that includes 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' and logs to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a strong indicator of malicious activity. Keylogging is typically used for stealing sensitive information. The script paths are obfuscated with backslashes and quotes, which might be an attempt to evade detection. \n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so normal in some contexts. However, if PowerShell is loading these DLLs in an unusual way or in combination with other suspicious activities, it could be a sign of something malicious. \n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent entries for Chrome might be benign, but combined with the keylogger script and the PowerShell activities, it's a concerning pattern. The presence of multiple Get-Keystrokes.ps1 executions from different paths suggests an attempt to log keystrokes, which is a clear sign of a potential security threat. \n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of the keylogger script, multiple PowerShell events, and the loaded .NET components points towards a possible malicious activity. Even though some events could be normal, the overall pattern is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing keystroke logging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) with temporary log paths, combined with .NET assembly loads and repeated registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where PowerShell is executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines all have similar structures, with different paths each time. The key part here is the script name and the parameter -LogPath $env:TEMP\\key.log. The fact that the same script is being run multiple times from different directories might indicate something malicious. Typically, malware uses such scripts to capture keystrokes, which is a red flag.\n\nThen there are events related to file creation and deletion. For example, a temporary file is created and then deleted, which is common in some attack patterns to avoid leaving traces. Also, the registry value set events might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, there are also normal activities like Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded, which are legitimate. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file is part of a monitoring tool, which is normal if they're using that software.\n\nBut the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from various paths is suspicious. Even though the script name is the same, the different paths might be part of obfuscation techniques. The fact that the same log path is used each time could mean they're trying to collect keystrokes and store them in a predictable location, which is a common tactic.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The \"Execute a Remote Command\" event might be related, but the process is listed as None, which could be an error or a placeholder. However, the file path mentioned there is another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, so that's another point.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple executions of the same keystroke-logging script from different locations, combined with file creation and deletion, suggest potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the pattern here is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with consistent log path ($env:TEMP\\\\key.log) across varying file paths, suggesting potential keystroke logging behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these three events to determine if they're interesting or not. First, looking at each entry.\n\nThe first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate system process that hosts various system services. The file path mentioned is part of the Delivery Optimization feature, which is used by Windows for content delivery. The file name is keyValueLKG.dat, which might be a temporary or state file. Since svchost.exe is a normal process and the file is in a standard location, this might be a legitimate activity. But I should check if there's any unusual behavior here, like unexpected file creation. However, Delivery Optimization does create files during its operations, so this might be normal.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, often used for monitoring and sending logs. The presence of a .new file suggests that it's in the process of writing a configuration file, which is a common operation during setup or updates. The path is in the Downloads folder, which is typical for user-installed software. This seems legitimate unless there's a reason to suspect the winlogbeat instance is malicious. But without more context, like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected behavior, this might be normal.\n\nThe third event is about powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads directory. PowerShell is a common tool used by both legitimate users and attackers. The file name is entrada_padrao.txt, which translates to \"standard input.txt\" in Portuguese. This could be a benign file created by the user, but it's also possible that it's part of a script or malicious activity. However, just creating a text file isn't necessarily suspicious. The key here is whether there's any other context, like the use of PowerShell for downloading files, executing commands, or other signs of compromise. But with the given data, it's just a file creation.\n\nLooking at all three events together, none of them seem to be clearly malicious. The processes involved are legitimate, and the file creations are in standard locations. However, the presence of multiple file creations could be part of a larger pattern. But since each event is isolated and there's no indication of unusual activity (like unexpected processes, network connections, or privilege escalation), the overall classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The confidence would be moderate because while there's no obvious malicious activity, the presence of multiple file creations could be a red flag if there were more context or other events. But with the given information, they don't seem suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in standard locations. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected in the provided events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
