{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Some of them have tasks like File created, Process accessed, and Registry value set. Then, there's a specific event where a file named \"objeto_temporario.txt\" is created in the Downloads folder. That's a temporary file, maybe just a normal user activity, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nBut wait, looking further, there's a process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves the log to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystroke logging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information. The fact that it's being executed via PowerShell, which is often used in attacks, raises a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs. While loading .NET assemblies isn't inherently bad, the combination with the keystroke logging script might indicate something malicious. The repeated Registry value set events by chrome.exe could be benign if it's just normal operations, but Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much. However, if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be something else.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessAccess events and the use of PowerShell to execute scripts that log keystrokes strongly suggest potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be normal, the combination here points towards an investigation being necessary. The confidence is high because keystroke logging is a clear indicator of potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute suspicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) to log keystrokes to temporary files, indicating potential data exfiltration. Combined with .NET DLL image loads and repeated registry modifications, this suggests malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries with PowerShell commands. The command lines all seem to be running a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from different paths, each time with the -LogPath parameter pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information like passwords.\n\nNow, the paths where the scripts are being executed from are all over the place: C:\\objeto_secundario..., C:\\registro_ativo..., etc. These don't look like standard system directories. Usually, legitimate scripts might be in more common locations, but these seem arbitrary and possibly obfuscated. The use of multiple different paths might be an attempt to evade detection by changing locations each time.\n\nAlso, there are entries about files being created and deleted in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. The FileCreate and FileDelete events could be part of the malware's operation, trying to leave no trace. Additionally, the Pipe Created event might indicate some form of inter-process communication, which could be used by malware to communicate with a C2 server.\n\nHowever, there are also some normal events, like ImageLoad for Windows Defender components and legitimate file creations related to PowerShell profiles. But the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths and the presence of multiple Temp file operations suggest a pattern that's not normal.\n\nThe classification here should be INTERESTING because the logs show multiple instances of a keystroke logging script being executed from various non-standard paths, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, because the pattern is consistent and the behavior is suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' from non-standard paths with consistent logging to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file in C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, often hosting various system services. The file path is under DeliveryOptimization, which is part of Windows Update. This might be normal, but I should note that.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs. The file is a .yml.new, which could be a temporary file during configuration. This seems normal too, but maybe the user is setting up winlogbeat, which is a common scenario.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe created a file in Downloads called entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell is a common tool, and creating a text file isn't suspicious. However, sometimes malicious activities use PowerShell to create files, but in this case, it's just a regular text file. \n\nLooking at all together: All files are created in legitimate locations. The processes involved are all legitimate. No unusual file types or paths that are typically associated with malware. No signs of privilege escalation, unexpected network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The events don't seem to indicate any malicious activity. \n\nBut wait, maybe the fact that three different processes are creating files in different locations could be part of a larger pattern. However, each individual event doesn't show signs of being malicious. The classification should be based on whether there's a reason to investigate further. Since none of the events are clearly malicious, but they are just normal process activities, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING. The confidence is medium because while the events are normal, the presence of multiple file creations might be a red herring, but without more context, there's no clear threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in standard system or user directories. No suspicious file paths, unexpected process behavior, or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
