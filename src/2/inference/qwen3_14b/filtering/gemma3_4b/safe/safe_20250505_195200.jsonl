However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files with hashes might be more typical of a legitimate package, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI should also check if there are any known issues or malware associated with SDXHelper.exe. From my knowledge, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate file, but if it's being used in an unusual way, like creating a large number of files in a short time, that could be suspicious.

The file names are all similar, like excel-copilot-strings with different hashes. Hmm, that's a lot of file creations. But wait, SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, part of Microsoft's Office, right? It's involved in managing solution packages. So maybe these are just normal operations. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be a red flag. But I need to check if this is normal behavior.\n\nThen there's an entry for MdSched.exe being created.

Maybe the user is just configuring it, which is normal.\n\nNow, looking at the SDXHelper.exe activity again. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory under SolutionPackages. I recall that sometimes malicious software might use legitimate directories to hide files. But if these are just resources for Excel Copilot, maybe they're legitimate.

However, the repetition of the same file creation events could be a red flag. \n\nI should also consider the possibility of log duplication.

The task is to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Add-ins or solutions. It's involved in managing and deploying add-ins, which might involve creating files in those directories. However, the key here is to check if the activity is normal or suspicious.\n\nLooking at the logs, there are multiple entries of the same process creating different JS files. The file paths are all within the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office SolutionPackages folder. The filenames include things like vendors~file-link-plugin.js, excel-copilot-strings_...js, etc. These names seem to be part of legitimate Office add-ins or copilot features, which are known to use such naming conventions.\n\nHowever, I should consider the possibility of malicious activity. If SDXHelper.exe is creating files in a directory that's typically used for legitimate Office packages, but the files themselves are not part of known Office components, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the filenames seem to match the pattern of legitimate add-ins, like \"excel-copilot-strings\" which might be related to Excel's copilot feature. Also, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be part of a normal installation or update process.\n\nAnother thing to check is the number of events. There are 16 entries here, but they're repeated. For example, the same file is created twice in some cases. This could indicate that the process is being run multiple times, perhaps as part of a deployment. However, if the same file is created multiple times, that might be unusual. But looking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if they're all within a short timeframe, it might be part of a batch operation.\n\nI should also consider the user's environment. If this is a user named \"fiddelis,\" maybe that's a test account or a specific user context. But without more information, it's hard to say. The key is whether the activity deviates from normal behavior. If SDXHelper.exe is known to create these files during normal operations, then it's not suspicious. However, if there's no prior knowledge of such activity, it might warrant further investigation.\n\nBut given that the files are in the SolutionPackages directory and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office solutions, it's more likely to be legitimate. The confidence here would be moderate, but since the files are named in a way that aligns with Office add-ins, it's probably not malicious. However, the high number of events might still be worth checking to ensure that there's no unexpected behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directories, which aligns with legitimate Office add-in deployment behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, all the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some package resources.\n\nFirst, I notice that the same files are being created multiple times. For example, excel-copilot-strings_34914bd0983d608e4e1d45ac13c214ba.js appears twice, and similarly for others. That repetition might be a red flag. But wait, maybe it's just normal operations where the same file is being created again, like during an update or installation. However, the fact that multiple files are created in the same directory could indicate something. \n\nLooking at the process name, SDXHelper.exe – I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office, specifically for handling solution packages. So, if these files are part of Office's normal operations, then this might be benign. However, the names of the files include \"excel-copilot-strings\" and \"vendors~code-preview-dialog\", which might be part of some Office add-ins or features. \n\nBut why so many files being created? Maybe during an installation or update, but the repetition of the same files could be suspicious. However, the user might have installed multiple packages, each creating their own files. Alternatively, if these files are being created in a non-standard way, that could be a sign of malicious activity. \n\nAnother thing to check is the paths. The files are in the SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office packages. The presence of hashes in the filenames (like 34914bd0983d608e4e1d45ac13c214ba) suggests they might be versioned or uniquely identified files. That's common in software distributions. \n\nHowever, the fact that the same process is creating multiple files with similar names might be part of a legitimate process, like deploying multiple resources for an Office add-on. But I should also consider if there's any indication of unusual behavior. Since there are no other events like process creation, network activity, or user logins, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe justification for classification would hinge on whether creating multiple JavaScript files in that directory is normal. Since SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, and the files are in expected locations, this might not be malicious. However, the repetition and the number of files could be a sign of something. But without additional context or other suspicious events, it's hard to be certain. \n\nI think the confidence here is moderate. It's not clearly malicious, but the pattern is unusual enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. \n\nIf these files are part of a legitimate Office package, then it's normal. However, if the user didn't install any new Office add-ons or updates, this could be unexpected. Since the batch doesn't include other events, it's hard to confirm. But the presence of multiple file creations by the same process in a specific directory might be a sign of something. \n\nI think the key here is that the files are being created by a legitimate process in a legitimate location. Therefore, it's not clearly malicious, but the repetition might be worth looking into. However, without more context, it's not conclusive. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activity is likely legitimate. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, but the user is asking whether the batch is relevant for investigation. If the events are all part of normal operations, then it's not interesting. But if the repetition and the number of files are outside the norm, then it might be. Since I don't have historical data, I have to rely on known patterns. \n\nGiven that SDXHelper.exe is associated with Office and the files are in SolutionPackages, which is a known directory for such files, I think this is likely legitimate. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. But I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, if the repetition is a red flag, maybe it's \"INTERESTING\". \n\nHmm. I need to make a call. Since the process is legitimate and the location is expected, even with multiple files, it's probably not malicious.

On one hand, the repeated file creation by a legitimate process could be normal. On the other, the number of files and the specific naming might be indicative of something.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event by SDXHelper.exe in various paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The first thing I notice is that the same process, SDXHelper.exe, is creating multiple JavaScript files in different directories. \n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's a legitimate Microsoft process. Wait, Microsoft Office typically doesn't have a process named SDXHelper.exe. That might be a red flag. Legitimate processes usually have names that are more recognizable, like \"MicrosoftOffice.exe\" or similar.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are things like officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js and word-copilot.min_xxxxx.js. The \"aicopilot\" and \"word-copilot\" parts make me think of Microsoft's AI Copilot feature, but the filenames are minified JavaScript files. However, the presence of multiple files with different hashes (the long strings after min_) might be normal for updates or different versions. But why are they being created by SDXHelper.exe?\n\nNow, considering the repetition. There are multiple entries for the same files being created. For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_c62d76d06f0f547a17fe8ca50b485ab5.js appears twice. Maybe that's just logging the same event twice, but it's also possible that the process is creating the same file multiple times, which could be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the use of SolutionPackages. Microsoft Office might use that directory for storing package resources, but typically, those files would be part of installed applications. However, if SDXHelper.exe is creating these files, and if that process isn't a known legitimate one, that's concerning. Also, the fact that there are multiple different files being created in that directory might indicate an attempt to inject malicious code or download additional payloads.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the events are from a batch. If all these files are part of a legitimate installation or update, then it's not a threat. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a legitimate process, then this is suspicious. I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind – I don't recall that being a standard Microsoft process. It might be a third-party tool or malware.\n\nAlso, the filenames include \"copilot,\" which is a feature in Office 365. But the minified JavaScript files could be part of that feature. However, the repetition and the process name still raise flags. Maybe the process is a legitimate one, but the files are being created in a way that's not standard. Alternatively, the process could be a dropper, creating these files as part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother point: the timestamps. If all these events happened in a short period, that might indicate a rapid creation of files, which is suspicious. But the user didn't provide timestamps, so I can't tell. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might indicate that the system is trying to log the same event, or the process is being used to create multiple copies.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of an unusual process name (SDXHelper.exe) creating multiple JavaScript files in a Microsoft Office directory, possibly related to copilot features, but without clear evidence of being a legitimate process, suggests that this might be malicious. However, without more context, like the process's digital signature, parent process, or other events, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the fact that the same process is creating multiple files in a non-standard way, and the process name isn't recognized, makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office directories with suspicious JavaScript filenames (e.g., 'officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js') suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. All the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files have names like officeaicopilotchatstrings_af_... and word-copilot.min_... with various hashes.\n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, Microsoft Office might use such helper processes for updates or installations. However, the presence of multiple files being created in the SolutionPackages directory could be part of a normal update process. But wait, the filenames include \"copilot\" and \"aicopilotchatstrings,\" which might relate to Microsoft Copilot features. However, the hashes in the filenames are unique, which could indicate different versions or packages.\n\nBut why are there duplicates? Some files are created multiple times. That might just be redundant logging, or maybe the process is attempting to create the same file more than once. However, if these files are part of a legitimate Office update, it's possible that the system is downloading or installing multiple components. However, the path is under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which is a known directory for Office updates. \n\nBut I should also consider if this is a sign of malicious activity. Malware sometimes creates files in temporary or user-specific directories. However, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but I should verify if it's the actual one. If the process is legitimate, then these file creations might be normal. However, if the process is not the genuine SDXHelper.exe, that's a red flag. But the logs don't provide information about the process's path or digital signature, so I can't confirm that.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames have language codes (like 'af' and 'am'), which might indicate localization files. If these are part of a Copilot feature, it's possible that these are legitimate language packs. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a sign of something else. But maybe the logs are just capturing multiple events for the same file creation, which could be normal.\n\nAlternatively, if the files are being created in a user's AppData directory, that's a common place for legitimate software to store data. However, if the files are being created in a way that's not typical for the software, that could be suspicious. But without more context, like the process's origin or if there are other anomalous events, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering all that, the files are in a legitimate directory, created by a process that could be legitimate. However, the repetition and the specific filenames with hashes might be normal for updates. But since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I need to decide if this is a false positive or a potential threat. Given that the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, and the files are in the correct location, maybe this is not interesting. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.5, but I'm leaning towards 'NOT INTERESTING' because it's likely part of a normal Office update process.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office updates and language packs.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are named with a pattern like \"word-copilot.min_...\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\", followed by some hash-like strings.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? It's involved in handling add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple files with similar names in the Office SolutionPackages directory... Hmm. Office usually stores add-ins and solutions there, but the filenames here have \"copilot\" in them. Microsoft Copilot is a feature in Office, so maybe these are legitimate updates or components. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times by the same process? That could indicate a loop or an attempt to inject malicious code.\n\nWait, but looking at the paths, they're all under the user's AppData Local directory. That's a common place for temporary files or user-specific data. However, the fact that the same files are being created multiple times might be normal if there's a reinstall or update. But the hash parts of the filenames are different each time. That might be normal for different versions, but the same file names being created repeatedly could be a sign of something else.\n\nAnother angle: the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate, but if it's creating a lot of files, maybe that's part of a legitimate process. However, the number of entries here is quite a few. Let me count. There are 16 entries here. Each entry is a file creation. So, multiple files being created by SDXHelper.exe. But the same files are being created multiple times. For example, the first two entries are the same file. Then another two entries for a different file, and so on. That seems redundant. Why would the same file be created multiple times? That might be a sign of a loop or an error in the process. Alternatively, maybe the system is trying to install multiple components, but the same file is being generated each time.\n\nAlternatively, the hash parts might be unique identifiers for different versions or components. However, the repetition of the same file names (like \"word-copilot.min_...\" with different hashes) might be normal if they are different files. But if the same exact file is being created multiple times, that's suspicious. However, looking at the paths, each entry has different hash parts, so the filenames are different. So, maybe that's just multiple different files being created as part of an update or installation process.\n\nBut why so many? Microsoft Office updates can create a lot of files, but the fact that all these are being created by SDXHelper.exe might be normal. However, I should check if there's any known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but it's possible for malware to masquerade as it. However, without more context, like the process's parent or other behaviors, it's hard to tell. But in this case, the logs only show file creation events.\n\nAnother point: the files are JavaScript files (\".js\"). Office add-ins can include JavaScript, but creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory might be part of a legitimate add-in. However, the naming with \"copilot\" might be related to Microsoft's Copilot feature, which is a legitimate part of Office. So, perhaps these files are part of a legitimate update or add-in installation.\n\nBut the repetition of the same file names (but with different hashes) could be a sign of something. Wait, no, the hashes are different, so each is a different file. So maybe it's just multiple files being created as part of a package. However, the number of files here is quite high. 16 entries, which might be excessive for a normal process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a false positive. The system might be logging each file creation event, but if the process is legitimate, then it's not a security issue. However, the fact that the same process is creating so many files in a short period could be suspicious. But without more context, like timestamps or other processes involved, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, while the process is legitimate, the high number of file creation events, especially in a directory typically used for Office add-ins, might indicate a potential issue. However, without additional indicators of compromise (like unexpected network activity, process injection, or other anomalous behaviors), it's possible that this is a legitimate update. But given the volume of file creations and the repetition, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, as it's worth further investigation to confirm whether this is part of a normal update or a potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which is unusual for this process.
