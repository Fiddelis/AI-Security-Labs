The first event stands out: WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That's unusual because WMIC is often used by attackers for command execution, and the path points to a legitimate Defender file, which might be a sign of a false flag or a compromised Defender component.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries involving Registry value sets by processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, and conhost.exe. While some of these might be benign, the high frequency and involvement of chrome.exe and conhost.exe could indicate an attempt to modify registry settings for persistence or to alter the behavior of the system.\n\nThere's also a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries that copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's a classic technique used in attacks to replace the Sticky Keys utility with a malicious payload, which is a red flag for a potential attack.\n\nAdditionally, multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes might suggest an attacker using PowerShell for further exploitation. The use of schtasks.exe to delete a task named \"win32times\" could be an attempt to remove evidence or a scheduled task that's part of the attack.\n\nHowever, some events are normal, like whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command for checking user context.

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is executed. That's a standard command to get the current user, so maybe just a normal process. But then there are multiple entries for 'powershell.exe' with various tasks. The tasks include Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. \n\nLooking at the Image loaded events, they're loading some .dll files from the Windows directory, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so maybe PowerShell is using them normally. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1, and then it's deleted. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting a script file might be part of an attack, like executing a malicious script and then cleaning up traces.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries with the command line 'powershell.exe & {}', which is an empty command. That might be a sign of something trying to obfuscate or test the environment. The 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks could be related to PowerShell's execution policies or some modules being loaded, but repeated entries might indicate something unusual.\n\nAnother point is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of normal monitoring, but if it's creating a new config file, maybe that's a red flag if it's unexpected. However, the user hasn't mentioned any other anomalies related to that.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell activities, especially the creation and deletion of a temporary script, loading of .NET DLLs, and the empty command lines could indicate an attacker trying to execute a script and then remove evidence. However, some of these events might be benign, like normal PowerShell usage or legitimate scripts. But the combination of these events, especially the file creation and deletion in Temp, might be worth investigating further. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities could be normal, but the pattern is suspicious enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including temporary script file creation\/deletion, repeated empty command executions, and loading of .NET framework DLLs, which could indicate malicious activity or script obfuscation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through the events. The first event is about 'schtasks.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll' from the System32 directory. That seems normal because schtasks.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. But I should note that sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes, so maybe that's a red flag if there are other anomalies.\n\nNext, there's 'svchost.exe' with a registry event. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so registry changes here might be normal, but they could also be part of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there are several instances of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' with registry value set events. PowerShell and cmd are often used by attackers for executing commands, so multiple registry changes here might indicate something. However, legitimate scripts also use these tools, so it's not conclusive yet.\n\nLooking at the 'chrome.exe' entries, there are image loaded events for 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. If Chrome is loading these DLLs, that might be normal if it's interacting with Defender, but maybe it's a sign of something else if it's not expected.\n\nThere are also multiple 'Process accessed' events for 'powershell.exe'. This could be part of normal operations, but if there's a pattern of access attempts, it might be suspicious. However, without seeing actual malicious activity, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, looking at the overall picture: the logs show a mix of normal processes and system events. There's no clear indication of a breach or malicious activity. The presence of legitimate processes like svchost, chrome, and cmd is expected. The registry changes and process accesses are common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios, but there's no evidence of unusual behavior such as unexpected network connections, unauthorized file modifications, or privilege escalation.\n\nThe only slightly suspicious point is the 'schtasks.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll', but that's a standard operation. The other events don't show a clear pattern of compromise. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, the batch might not be interesting for investigation. However, if there were more anomalies or a different context, it might be different. But based on the given data, I think it's more likely \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system activity with no clear indicators of compromise.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: RuntimeBroker.exe with a Registry value set. That's a normal process, so maybe not a problem. Then there's powershell.exe with Process accessed. PowerShell is common, but when it's used for malicious purposes, it can be a red flag. However, just accessing a process isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNext, notepad.exe and calc.exe with Registry changes. Notepad and Calculator are standard apps, so that's probably normal. But then there's an entry for Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected place or in an unusual context, that might be a problem. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location, so that might be okay.\n\nLooking further, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file there might be normal if it's part of setup. But the filename is .yml.new, which could indicate a temporary file during configuration, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so not suspicious on its own. ApplicationFrameHost.exe with Registry changesâ€”again, that's a normal process. \n\nNow, looking at the cmd.exe command: \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That's a command to delete processes. Using wmic to delete processes isn't uncommon, but the fact that it's being used here might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern. However, the command line shows it's being run with \/c to execute the wmic command, which is a common way to run commands. But the deletion of notepad.exe might be part of a legitimate action, like cleaning up after a task.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe being created, which is a known tool that can be abused for malicious activities. The command line here is \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\", which is the same as the previous cmd command. Also, ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading that might be normal, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is the multiple instances of powershell.exe with Process accessed and Registry value set. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so frequent access or changes might be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting this all together: There are a few suspicious elements, like the use of wmic and powershell, but many of these are common processes and legitimate activities. The key is whether these events, when combined, indicate a potential attack. For example, using wmic to delete a process might be part of a larger attack, but on its own, it's not conclusive. The presence of multiple PowerShell events and Registry changes could indicate someone is trying to manipulate the system. However, there's not enough evidence here to confirm a breach. The confidence level might be moderate, but not high enough to be certain. So, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because there are some signs that could be indicative of malicious activity, but not enough to be certain.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender path. That's a legitimate file, so probably not an issue. Next, there's a file created in the user's AppData directory. That could be normal, but sometimes malware creates files there. But just creating a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're modifying key settings or adding new entries. But without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to tell. The logs don't specify which registry keys, so maybe that's a point to consider.\n\nLooking at the command lines for powershell.exe, there are multiple instances where they're checking if certain .bat files exist. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" â€“ the use of \"..\" suggests they're navigating up directories, which might be trying to access files in parent directories. That could be a way to bypass security measures or access files that shouldn't be accessible. \n\nAlso, the repeated pattern of checking for the existence of these .bat files with specific paths might indicate that the attacker is looking for specific scripts that could be used for further exploitation. If those files don't exist, the script exits with 1, which could be part of a larger attack plan where the presence of these files is a condition for proceeding.\n\nThere's also a process accessed event for powershell.exe multiple times, which might be normal, but combined with the other events, it could be part of a sequence of actions. The ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are legitimate .NET components, so those are probably not malicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, checking for specific .bat files in non-standard paths, and registry modifications might indicate an attempt to execute or modify scripts in a way that's not typical. Even though none of the individual events are definitively malicious, the overall pattern could be suspicious. \n\nI should also consider that PowerShell is often used by attackers for various malicious activities, so increased usage might be a red flag. The fact that there are multiple checks for the existence of these .bat files could be part of a larger attack chain, such as checking for the presence of a payload or a configuration file.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Without more context, like the actual content of the .bat files or more detailed registry changes, it's a bit hard to be certain. However, the combination of these events does raise enough suspicion to warrant further investigation.

These are all legitimate .NET Framework files. Then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is also a legitimate file. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of a normal process, but sometimes attackers do this to hide their activities. However, since it's a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script, and it's in the Temp folder, that could be normal if it's part of a test or temporary execution.\n\nAnother file created is elemento_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. That seems benign, just a regular text file. Then there are multiple registry value set events from Chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but the repetition of the same task multiple times might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event for PowerShell, which could be part of inter-process communication, but again, not necessarily malicious. The command lines for PowerShell check if certain batch files exist and exit with 0 or 1. These paths have some odd directory structures with \"..\\\" which might be trying to access parent directories, but again, that's common in scripts.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell execution policy checks, maybe the user is testing script execution policies. The files created and deleted might be part of that testing. However, the presence of multiple events related to file creation and deletion, along with registry changes, could be a sign of something more. But the majority of the events are related to legitimate processes and standard operations.\n\nI should check if there's any unusual combination. The fact that PowerShell is loading legitimate DLLs and then creating\/deleting files in Temp might be normal. The Chrome registry events are repetitive but not necessarily harmful. The command lines don't show any obvious malicious commands like downloading payloads or executing harmful code.\n\nConsidering all that, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events seem to be part of normal operations, possibly testing or temporary file handling.

The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first one shows a PowerShell command creating a file and setting content. The command line uses New-Item and Set-Content, which are typical for creating and modifying files. The paths mentioned look a bit suspicious because they have multiple directory jumps with \"..\\\", which might be trying to access parent directories. That could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. Accessing processes and modifying registry values can be part of legitimate activities, but combined with other events, it might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the \"Image loaded\" events, PowerShell is loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events might be just part of the process's normal operation, but I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. The command lines here are similar to the first one, creating files in various directories and setting their content to \"dir\". The repetition of this pattern across different paths might be a sign of automated script execution. The use of \"dir\" as the content is simple, but if these scripts are being created in multiple locations, it could be part of a larger operation, maybe trying to execute commands or establish persistence.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The PowerShell process is creating multiple batch files in different directories, each with the \"dir\" command. While \"dir\" itself is a harmless command, the fact that these files are being created in various locations might be a way to distribute or execute scripts. The combination of file creation, registry access, and process access could indicate an attempt to modify system behavior or install malware.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating scripts isn't inherently malicious. But the repetitive pattern and the use of multiple directory jumps in file paths could be indicative of an attacker trying to obfuscate their activities.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There are enough suspicious elementsâ€”repeated file creation with similar commands, access to processes and registry, and the use of PowerShellâ€”which are often associated with malicious activities. However, without more context or additional suspicious events (like network activity or unexpected process execution), it's not definitive.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be a JSON with classification, justification, and confidence. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event and see what's happening. The majority of the events involve PowerShell processes. There are several 'File created' events, which might be normal, but sometimes they can indicate malicious activity. Let me check the file paths. For example, there's a file created at 'C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\objeto_comum_script.bat'. That looks like a batch file, which could be used for executing commands. \n\nThen there's the command line in one of the processes: 'New-Item \"C:\\estrutura_base\\objeto_logico\\..\\\\modulo_base\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\" -Force | Out-Null\\nSet-Content -Path \"C:\\pacote_temporario\\pacote_geral\\..\\\\entrada_temporario\\componente_comum_script.bat\" -Value \"dir\"'. Hmm, creating files and writing content to them. The use of '..\\' in the paths might be a red flag. That's a common technique to bypass certain security measures or to obfuscate the actual path. \n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET assemblies like clr.dll, mscoree.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell since it uses the .NET framework, but if there's an unusual number or unexpected paths, that could be suspicious. However, in this case, the paths seem legitimate as they are standard Windows system directories.\n\nAnother thing is the 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that multiple registry events are logged might be worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the 'Process accessed' events, but they don't have any specific details. The 'Pipe Created' event is also normal in some cases, but again, not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. There's a pattern of creating files in various directories, using PowerShell to write scripts, and modifying the registry. The repetition of similar commands in different paths might indicate an automated process, possibly part of a script that's being deployed. The use of '..\\' in the file paths could be an attempt to evade detection by making the paths look less obvious. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. These could be legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of multiple file creations, registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell with obfuscated paths raises some flags. The confidence here isn't 100% because without more context, like network activity or unusual process behavior, it's hard to be certain. But the presence of these patterns is enough to warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, the classification would be 'INTERESTING' because the events show suspicious activity that could indicate a potential security threat, even though it's not conclusive. The justification would be the creation of multiple files with PowerShell, use of obfuscated paths, and registry modifications. Confidence is around 0.7 because it's not definitive but the combination of events is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating files with obfuscated paths (e.g., using '..\\\\') and writing script content, combined with registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity or suspicious automation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}

So, first, I'll look at each event to see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. The command lines for these PowerShell instances are checking if certain files exist. The paths mentioned are all in directories like 'C:\\pacote_principal' or 'C:\\elemento_geral', which seem a bit generic. But the fact that they're checking for specific executable files might be suspicious. \n\nWait, the PowerShell commands are using Test-Path to check if these files exist and then exiting 0 or 1. That could be part of a script that's checking for the presence of certain files, maybe as part of a setup or installation. But why so many different paths? Maybe trying to see if specific payloads are present?\n\nThen, looking at the 'Image loaded' events. PowerShell is loading several .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so loading them is normal. But if there were any unusual DLLs, that would be a red flag. However, here they're all legitimate system files.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. The repeated use of PowerShell to check for the existence of various files in different directories could be part of a larger process, maybe trying to locate files or check for prerequisites. However, the sheer number of different paths checked might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for specific files, which could be part of a more complex attack. \n\nBut on the other hand, these could be part of a legitimate application's startup process, checking for dependencies. Without more context, like the presence of other suspicious activities (like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, etc.), it's hard to say. However, the fact that all these checks are done via PowerShell, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, might raise some flags.\n\nThe 'Process Create' and 'Process accessed' events are also there, but they don't show any obvious malicious activity. The main thing is the multiple Test-Path commands. In a malicious context, this could be part of a script that's checking for the presence of certain files before proceeding with further actions, like execution or data exfiltration. However, without seeing the actual files being checked or other actions taken, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like downloading payloads, executing unknown files, etc.), but the pattern of checking multiple file paths with PowerShell is somewhat suspicious, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.

That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the specific events.\n\nThe first event mentions the loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe it's a red herring. Then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily. The file name has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. That's suspicious because it's being created and then immediately deleted, which might be an attempt to hide the script's presence.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but not sure if that's malicious here. Then there are several 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command lines checking for the existence of certain executables. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\registro_principal\\registro_temporario\\registro_secundario\\bin\\componente_secundario.exe\" seem arbitrary and not standard. These checks might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files exist, possibly to decide the next steps in an attack.\n\nAnother event shows a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a PowerShell-specific directory, so maybe the script is trying to set up something that runs at startup. Then there are multiple Registry value set events and Process accessed events. Changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThere are also events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe. Whoami is usually used to get user info, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack. The cmd.exe event checks if a file exists in the temp directory, similar to the PowerShell checks. This could be part of a multi-stage attack where different processes are involved.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell scripts creating and deleting files, checking for existence of executables in non-standard paths, registry modifications, and process access. These activities could indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts, establish persistence, or check for the presence of other components. The fact that the same script is being tested in different directories and using temporary files might be a way to avoid detection.

Hmm, maybe that's part of some automated process, but the fact that they're checking multiple such files across different directories could be suspicious.\n\nThen there are entries about files being created and deleted in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. The creation and deletion of temporary files is common, but if it's part of a script that's being tested or executed, that might not be harmful. However, the fact that PowerShell is involved in creating and deleting these files could be part of a larger operation.\n\nAlso, there are entries about image loaded events, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's normal, but maybe if there's an unusual number of such events, but here there are only a couple. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably part of normal operations, especially if someone is setting up monitoring.\n\nThen there's a registry value set and process accessed events. Those could be benign, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The repeated PowerShell commands checking for .bat files in various paths with directory traversal might indicate that someone is trying to execute scripts from non-standard locations. The use of '..' in the paths could be an attempt to bypass certain security measures or to access files in parent directories that shouldn't be accessible. However, the exit codes suggest that the scripts are not being executed, just checked for existence. That might be part of a legitimate process, but the pattern of multiple such checks could be part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of a payload or trying to determine if certain conditions are met before proceeding.\n\nBut wait, all the PowerShell commands are just checking if a file exists and exiting. If they were actually executing the .bat files, that would be more concerning. However, the presence of multiple such checks in different directories might be a sign of something automated, maybe a script that's looking for specific files to run, or perhaps part of a larger attack chain. The fact that there are multiple instances of this pattern might be more suspicious than a single occurrence.\n\nAdditionally, the creation of temporary files in AppData\\Local\\Temp could be part of normal PowerShell operations, but if combined with the other checks, it might indicate that the user is running scripts that are generating temporary files and then cleaning them up, which is common in some malicious activities.\n\nHowever, without seeing the actual content of the .bat files or more context on what's happening, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands with similar structures might be a red flag, but not definitive. The confidence level would depend on how common this pattern is in normal vs malicious behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the events like the image loaded from Windows Defender are normal, and the winlogbeat activity is also likely benign. The registry and process access events are common in many scenarios.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has some suspicious patterns (repeated PowerShell checks with directory traversal) but not enough to confirm malicious activity. It's on the edge. Maybe the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because the repeated checks could be part of a larger attack, but without more evidence, it's not certain. The justification would be the recurring PowerShell commands checking for files in possibly suspicious paths with directory traversal, which could indicate probing for the presence of scripts or other payloads.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of .bat files in non-standard paths with directory traversal (e.g., '..\\\\').

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell processes. There's a lot of file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1 file being created and then deleted. That might be normal, like temporary files being used and then cleaned up. But then there are some Image loaded events pointing to Windows Defender DLLs. That's probably legitimate since Defender is a trusted process. \n\nHowever, looking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking for the existence of files named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various directories. The script is testing if these files exist and exiting with 0 or 1 accordingly. Now, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds suspicious. Typically, keystroke logging is associated with malicious activities like keyloggers. Even though the scripts here are just checking for the existence of the file and not executing it, the presence of such a filename in multiple paths could indicate an attempt to locate or use a malicious script.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Process accessed events and Registry value set events, which might be part of normal operations, but combined with the keystroke-related filenames, it raises a red flag. The fact that the same script name is being checked in different directories might suggest an attacker trying to access or deploy a keylogger across different locations. \n\nHowever, none of the events show the actual execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, just checking if it exists. So it's possible that this is part of a benign process, maybe a script that's supposed to run but the files aren't present. But the repeated checks and the filename itself are concerning. \n\nI need to weigh the significance. The presence of the filename alone might not be enough, but combined with the PowerShell activities and the multiple checks, it's worth looking into.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with powershell.exe being accessed or created. The winlog tasks include ProcessAccess, ProcessCreate, RegistryEvent, and ImageLoad. The ImageLoad events mention loading .dll files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are .NET related DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe there's something else here.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some of them have PowerShell scripts that check if certain files exist. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\...\\\\src\\\\...cs\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}\". These paths look like they're checking for specific CS files in various directories. The paths mentioned are all in different locations, but they all end with .cs files, which are C# source files. \n\nWait, why would PowerShell be checking for C# files? That seems odd. Typically, PowerShell scripts might generate or compile C# code, but just checking if they exist might be part of a setup or deployment process. However, if these files are part of a legitimate application, that's fine. But if they're part of an attack, maybe the attacker is trying to see if certain files are present before proceeding with malicious activities.\n\nAlso, the repeated use of PowerShell with these specific paths might indicate an attempt to locate or access files that could be part of a larger payload. The fact that multiple checks are being made across different directories could be a red flag. It might be part of a script that's trying to determine the environment or check for the presence of certain components before executing more complex operations.\n\nAnother thing is the loading of .NET DLLs. While that's normal for PowerShell, if there's an unusual number of DLLs being loaded or from unexpected locations, that could be a sign of something. But in this case, the DLLs are from standard .NET directories, so that might be okay.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes, checking for specific C# files, and the use of .NET DLLs might be part of a more complex attack. For example, an attacker might be using PowerShell to check if certain files exist as part of a multi-stage attack, where the presence of these files could indicate the next steps. Alternatively, it could be part of a legitimate application that uses PowerShell for setup, but the multiple checks might be suspicious.\n\nI need to consider if these activities are typical. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, but the specific checks for .cs files might be unusual. If the system is a development environment, this might be normal. But if it's a production system, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided context about the environment, I have to make an assumption. The logs don't show any obvious signs of malware like file creation or network activity, but the repeated checks for specific files could be a precursor to more malicious actions. The classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of PowerShell processes checking for C# files and loading .NET DLLs might indicate an attempt to probe the system or prepare for further actions. The confidence is medium because while it's not definitive proof of malicious activity, the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are observed checking for existence of specific .cs files across various paths, which may indicate probing for presence of code or resources.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to check the command lines and other details. \n\nThe first event has a command line that checks if a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in a specific path. The script exits 0 if it exists, else 1. That seems odd because checking for a file's existence might be part of a larger script, but on its own, it's not necessarily malicious. However, the filename \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" stands out. Keystroke logging is typically associated with keyloggers, which are malicious. So that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about images loaded, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. These are legitimate system files, so that's normal.

The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to hide the script's existence, which is suspicious. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to PowerShell execution policy testing, which could be legitimate. But combined with the other events, it's worth noting.\n\nThe Pipe Created event isn't necessarily bad, but it's another system activity. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a YAML file, which seems normal for a log shipper, so probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths suggest that someone is trying to determine if that malicious script is present. The creation and deletion of a temporary script might be part of an attack.

That's common, but sometimes it's used for malicious purposes. There's a file created event for StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Hmm, that might be normal, but I should check if that's a legitimate file. Also, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell, which could indicate someone trying to access or manipulate processes.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own. Notepad.exe and Calculator.exe are also normal, but the fact that they're accessing the registry might not be a big deal. However, svchost.exe has some registry changes and network connections. Svchost is a legitimate process, but if it's doing unexpected things, that could be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper.

Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at network connections, chrome.exe has multiple NetworkConnect events. That's normal for a browser. But svchost.exe also has network connections. Maybe not a big deal unless there's unusual traffic. Also, there's a DnsQuery from chrome, which is standard.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. The repeated ProcessAccess on PowerShell might indicate someone trying to interact with processes, maybe for persistence. The file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData could be part of setting up a profile that runs automatically. Also, the image loaded events for urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer, but that's a system file. Maybe that's normal.\n\nWait, the first event is a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. If that's a user's profile, maybe it's legitimate.

There's also a whoami.exe process, which is normal but might be part of a larger attack if used inappropriately.\n\nThe winlog tasks include things like ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, Registry value set, and ImageLoad.

The command lines involve commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These are PowerShell commands that recursively list files and directories. That's a common administrative task, but sometimes malicious actors use similar commands to search for files or exfiltrate data. However, just running these commands isn't necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a log entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file named '.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. However, there's no immediate indication of tampering here.\n\nAnother point is the 'Image loaded' event for 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so no red flags there.
