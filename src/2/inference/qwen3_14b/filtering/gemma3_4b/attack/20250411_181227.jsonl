So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances of powershell.exe executing commands. The command lines are similar, using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks. Each command is creating a scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon, with the principal set to Administrators group and high run level. The tasks are named things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. \n\nWait, creating a scheduled task with high privileges and running calc.exe? That seems odd. Normally, calc.exe is just a calculator, but using it in a scheduled task with admin rights might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is using it as a payload or testing if they can execute commands with elevated privileges.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries of the same command being executed, which could indicate an attempt to create multiple tasks, possibly to ensure persistence or to bypass detection. The repetition might be a tactic to overwhelm or test the system's defenses.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a registry value set and process access events, but they don't seem as concerning. The chrome.exe entries are about pipe creation and registry changes, which might be normal browsing activity. However, the image loaded events mention mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to .NET Framework. If PowerShell is loading these, maybe it's part of a .NET exploit or something else, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious part is the repeated use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with admin privileges running calc.exe. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate tool, the context here is suspicious. This could be a sign of someone trying to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code under admin rights. The repetition of similar commands across multiple events increases the likelihood of malicious intent. \n\nI should check if there's any other evidence, but the other events don't seem to tie into this. The confidence level is high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with such parameters is a common tactic in attacks. However, without more context, like other malicious activities or network traffic, it's a bit of a judgment call. But based solely on these logs, the classification is likely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) targeting the Administrators group, executing calc.exe at logon. This pattern suggests potential malicious persistence attempts through scheduled tasks, which is suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. Those are all legitimate .NET Framework files. So loading them might be normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual here. However, just loading system DLLs isn't necessarily a red flag unless there's something else.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That could be part of a normal script execution, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be suspicious. Maybe it's a sign of a temporary file used in an attack, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but again, not inherently malicious. However, if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be worth looking into.\n\nThe interesting part comes with the PowerShell command line. The command is using ScheduledTask to create a task that runs calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group having highest privileges. That's a clear example of someone trying to set up a scheduled task with elevated permissions. Using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks can be a method for persistence or privilege escalation. The use of \"Register-ScheduledTask estrutura_auxiliar$object\" might be a typo or obfuscation, but the intent is there.\n\nThen there are multiple events from Chrome.exe related to registry value sets. However, Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much, so this might be a red flag. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The same event is repeated multiple times, which could indicate a loop or a script that's making multiple changes.\n\nThe last few entries are about \"Execute a Remote Command\" with the process field as None. That's unusual because if the process is None, it might mean the event is not properly logged or there's a missing process name. However, multiple such events could indicate a remote command execution attempt, which is a serious security issue.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation with high privileges, are a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The combination of creating a scheduled task, using PowerShell for that, and the remote command execution events (even if the process is missing) points towards an investigation being necessary. The Chrome registry events are a bit ambiguous but might be a red herring or part of a larger attack. The confidence here would be medium to high because the scheduled task creation is a clear suspicious action, but there's also some noise from the Chrome events and the process-less remote commands.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show loading of legitimate system DLLs but also include a suspicious scheduled task creation with elevated privileges (Administrators group, RunLevel Highest) that executes calc.exe at logon. This could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. Additionally, 12 repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events with missing process information suggest potential remote code execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries have \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task. That's a red flag because executing remote commands can be part of an attack, like someone trying to run malicious code. But there are a lot of them, and some might be normal. Wait, but there are also entries about scheduled tasks being created. For example, there's a PowerShell command that creates a scheduled task with the action of running calc.exe, which is a common test program but could be a sign of something more if it's unexpected. The user here is setting up a task that runs at logon for administrators, which might be legitimate, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's an entry where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll. That's part of the Windows Task Scheduler, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Tasks directory called \"unidade_comum,\" which might be a custom task name. Also, svchost.exe is modifying the registry multiple times. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but excessive registry changes could indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory, which is a common place for malware to store data. Also, Chrome is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are related to antivirus and security features. Maybe that's normal, but if those files are being loaded in an unusual way, it could be a sign of evasion techniques.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The file creation there might be part of normal operations, but the user might be collecting logs. However, the combination of multiple suspicious activities like scheduled tasks, registry changes, and file creations in unexpected locations might indicate an attack.\n\nI need to check if all these events are part of a legitimate process or if they form a pattern. The repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events could be part of a larger attack, especially if they're from unknown sources or if they're followed by other suspicious activities. The scheduled task creation with calc.exe might be a test, but in a real scenario, it could be a backdoor.\n\nThe confidence level depends on how many of these events are actually suspicious. Since there are multiple events pointing to potential malicious activities, even if some are normal, the combination might be enough to flag this as interesting. However, I should consider that some events might be false positives. But given the presence of scheduled task creation, registry modifications, and file creation in user directories, it's leaning towards INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks, PowerShell creating a scheduled task with administrator privileges, svchost.exe modifying registry values, and file creation in system directories (e.g., Tasks\\\\unidade_comum).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the events. There are multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. That's a lot of them. Now, Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, but maybe it's normal for some operations. However, repeated registry changes could be a sign of something malicious, like a persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's just doing its job. But the file path has a .new extension, which sometimes is used during file creation or updates. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother entry is powershell.exe creating a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, which could be benign, but sometimes used in attacks. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily malicious. The name is in Spanish, which might be a red herring or just a normal file name.\n\nNow, looking at the combination. Chrome modifying the registry multiple times might be suspicious. But I should check if there's any other indicators. The other events are about file creation, which might be part of normal user activity. However, if all these events are happening in a short time frame, that could be a sign of an attack. But the logs don't mention timestamps, so I can't tell about timing.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat and powershell is normal in some environments, but if they're doing unusual actions, it might be a problem. However, the justification here is that the batch has multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, which is not typical. The other events are file creations that could be normal. But the confidence might be medium because while the registry changes are suspicious, they might not be enough on their own. However, the repetition of the same event (chrome.exe modifying registry) multiple times could indicate a potential issue. So, I'd lean towards interesting, but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated 'Registry value set' operations, which is unusual for a browser and may indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious registry modifications. Additional file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe could be benign but warrant further investigation when combined with the registry activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
