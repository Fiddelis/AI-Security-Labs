The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe being accessed. That's common, but not necessarily malicious. Then whoami.exe is created, which is a legitimate command for checking user identity. But then there's another powershell.exe access. Then a registry value set event. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that seems suspicious. The command line includes creating a service with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a red flag because creating a service to execute a non-existent script might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. \n\nThen, sc.exe is used to create another service with a similar path. The repeated registry value set events for services.exe and others might indicate tampering with system services. Also, there are multiple instances of 'Registry value set' events, which could be part of configuring the system for persistence.\n\nThe image loaded events for urlmon.dll are normal, but the presence of Calculator.exe and svchost.exe with those events doesn't seem harmful. However, the main concern here is the use of cmd.exe and sc.exe to create services pointing to non-existent scripts. That's a common technique in malware to execute code without leaving obvious files. \n\nAdditionally, the winlogbeat.exe event is about a file creation, which might be part of a legitimate log collection process, but in this context, it's not directly related to the suspicious activities. \n\nPutting it all together, the repeated service creation attempts with non-existent scripts and the registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence or command execution. The confidence is high because these are indicators commonly seen in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Attempt to create a Windows service with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1) via cmd.exe, 2) Repeated registry modification events, 3) PowerShell process access patterns that may indicate lateral movement or payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each log entry represents. Looking at the entries, they all seem to be Windows event logs. The keys are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The \"winlog\" field has a \"task\" that describes the event, like \"Registry value set\" or \"Image loaded\". The \"process\" has the name of the executable, such as \"chrome.exe\" or \"powershell.exe\". The \"file\" sometimes has a path, sometimes \"None\".\n\nNow, the task is to analyze all these events together. Let me go through each entry:\n\n1. ApplicationFrameHost.exe: Registry value set.\n2. Calculator.exe: Registry value set.\n3. powershell.exe: Registry value set.\n4. powershell.exe: Process accessed.\n5. chrome.exe: Pipe Created.\n6. Multiple chrome.exe entries with Registry value set.\n7. One chrome.exe entry with Image loaded, pointing to amsi.dll.\n8. Another chrome.exe with Image loaded, pointing to MpOAV.dll.\n9. Another powershell.exe Process accessed.\n\nHmm, so most of these are normal processes. ApplicationFrameHost.exe is part of Windows, Calculator is a standard app. Chrome is a common browser. PowerShell is a legitimate tool. But the events here are about registry changes, process access, and image loading.\n\nNow, registry value sets are common for legitimate software, but if there's a lot of them, especially from different processes, it could be a sign of something. However, in this case, the entries are spread out. For example, chrome.exe has several registry value sets, but that's not unusual for a browser that might modify settings. \n\nThe image loaded events are interesting. The amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If chrome is loading this DLL, that's normal because it's used for scanning. However, the other file path is \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender Platform. That's also a legitimate file. So those image loads seem okay.\n\nProcess accessed events for powershell.exe might be normal, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. However, just having a process accessed event doesn't indicate malicious activity on its own. \n\nLooking at the overall batch, there's no clear indication of a security incident. The processes involved are all legitimate, and the events are typical for normal system operations. Even though there are multiple registry changes, they are from standard applications. The image loaded events are pointing to legitimate system files. \n\nSo, I don't see any suspicious activity here. The logs don't show any anomalies that would require further investigation. Therefore, the classification should be NOT INTERESTING. The confidence is high because all the events are related to normal operations, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (e.g., Chrome, PowerShell, Calculator) performing normal system activities like registry modifications, pipe creation, and loading of legitimate system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
