The first event is about updater.exe from Google, which seems legitimate since it's part of Google's crash handler. Then there's cmdkey.exe listing credentials, which could be normal but might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process accessing a process, which isn't too unusual. But then there's a command line that includes a PowerShell script doing several things: getting local users, groups, listing credentials with cmdkey, listing files in C:\\Users, and checking local groups. That looks like information-gathering, which is often a precursor to an attack.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events related to Security Group Management and User Account Management. These could be part of normal administrative tasks, but when combined with the PowerShell activity, they might indicate someone is trying to enumerate users and groups, possibly to find targets for privilege escalation.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll might be normal, but if those DLLs are from unexpected locations or if there's any unusual behavior, that could be a red flag. However, the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThe PowerShell creating a file in the user's AppData folder and setting a registry value could be part of persistence mechanisms. If the script is writing to startup profiles or registry keys, that might be an attempt to maintain access.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of information-gathering commands (net user, get-localuser, cmdkey \/list), multiple process creations, and file\/registry modifications could indicate a malicious actor trying to explore the system and establish persistence. However, some of these activities could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But given the number of events related to security group and user management, and the PowerShell script's broad access, I'm leaning towards this being interesting for investigation. The confidence is around 0.75 because while some activities are normal, the pattern suggests potential reconnaissance or setup for further attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing commands to enumerate users\/groups, list credentials, and access sensitive directories.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious. But then there's a bunch of powershell.exe activities. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the entries has a powershell.exe process with a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That looks like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups, which could be part of reconnaissance. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could indicate that the process is interacting with antivirus components, which might be suspicious if it's not expected.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Creating and then immediately deleting a script could be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving traces. The script's name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a way to bypass execution policies, but that's just a guess.\n\nThe Provider Lifecycle events don't seem too concerning on their own, but combined with the other activities, they might indicate the process is being monitored or has some lifecycle management happening.\n\nPutting it all together: Chrome's activities are normal. The PowerShell events, especially the command line with system info gathering, loading unexpected DLLs, and creating\/deleting scripts, are more suspicious. The combination of these could indicate an attacker trying to explore the system and possibly prepare for further actions. However, without more context, like known bad indicators or additional malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of these PowerShell activities does raise flags. So the classification is probably INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including command-line execution of system reconnaissance commands (net user, get-localgroup), loading of .NET and Windows Defender-related DLLs, and creation\/deletion of a temporary script file.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to look through all the events. Let's see. There are several entries with \"powershell.exe\" in the command line. The command lines include commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands seem to be gathering information about local users, groups, and checking stored credentials. That's a red flag because such activities are often part of reconnaissance in a cyber attack.\n\nThen there's an event where \"net.exe\" is run with the user command, which is normal for checking users, but combined with the PowerShell commands, it might be part of a larger effort to map the system. Also, there's a \"net1.exe\" which might be a typo or a different version, but that's less common. \n\nAnother thing is the creation of a file called \"pacote_ativo.txt\" by PowerShell. Not sure what that file contains, but creating files in user directories could be suspicious. Also, there's a mention of \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a configuration file, which is a log shipper, but that's not inherently malicious unless it's being used in an unexpected way.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets. That might be related to some extension or settings, but repeated registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But since there are multiple Chrome entries, maybe it's just normal activity.\n\nThe other events involve image loading, like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll, which are legitimate system files. The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll also seems normal. The Pipe Created events for PowerShell and updater.exe might be part of normal processes, but again, depends on context.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell commands that gather system information, combined with file creation and registry changes, could indicate an attacker trying to gather information and establish persistence. However, some of these activities could be legitimate, like system monitoring or configuration changes. But the combination of multiple reconnaissance commands in PowerShell is suspicious. The confidence might be around 0.75 because while some activities are normal, the pattern of gathering user and group info, listing credentials, and creating files could be indicative of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands executing reconnaissance activities (user enumeration, credential listing, file system exploration) combined with file creation and process events suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each line one by one.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of the Elastic stack, so maybe normal. But creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration, but not suspicious on its own.\n\nSecond event: SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe part of some software, but loading urlmon.dll is normal for some applications. Not sure yet.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe created a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is common, but creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. Could be user activity or script.\n\nFourth event: MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe was run with command line arguments. The command line mentions installsource scheduler. That might be part of a scheduled update, which is normal. Not suspicious yet.\n\nNext two events: svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a standard host process for Windows services. Registry changes could be normal, but multiple entries might be worth checking. However, without more context, hard to tell.\n\nNext: MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loaded taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. Taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler. If this is part of Edge's update process, it's normal. But maybe if it's being loaded in an unusual way.\n\nAnother event: backgroundTaskHost.exe loaded urlmon.dll. BackgroundTaskHost is part of Windows, so this might be normal. But again, depends on context.\n\nThen winlogbeat.exe again creating the same .yml.new file. Maybe a configuration change, but if it's the same as before, not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event with registry access. PowerShell interacting with the registry could be part of legitimate scripts, but also could be part of malicious activities. However, without seeing the specific registry changes, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the whole batch, there are multiple events from legitimate processes like svchost, powershell, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate. Some file creations and registry changes. The presence of winlogbeat is normal for monitoring. The SDXHelper.exe might be a red flag if it's not a known process, but without more info, it's hard to tell. Also, the repetition of some events might be normal. However, the combination of multiple process creations and registry changes could indicate some activity that's worth investigating, but not necessarily malicious. Maybe a software installation or configuration change. However, the justification here is that there's no clear indication of malicious activity, so it might be classified as not interesting. But I'm a bit unsure. The confidence might be around 0.5, but maybe slightly higher. Alternatively, if there's no clear malicious pattern, it's not interesting. The presence of SDXHelper.exe could be a point of interest, but if it's a legitimate process, then it's not. Without more data, it's hard to say. So maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve standard system processes (svchost.exe, powershell.exe) and legitimate file operations (e.g., winlogbeat configuration files). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
