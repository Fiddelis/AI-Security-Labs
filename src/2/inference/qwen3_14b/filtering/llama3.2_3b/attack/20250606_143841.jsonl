So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit unusual because PowerShell scripts in startup folders can be used for persistence. Then there are multiple ImageLoad events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are normal system files, so maybe not a problem. But then there's a command line entry for cmd.exe that's trying to disable the firewall with \"netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". That's a red flag. Disabling the firewall is a common attack technique to allow unauthorized access.\n\nAlso, there's a FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Deleting a script might be an attempt to remove evidence. The Registry value set events could be part of configuring something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of PowerShell activities, attempting to disable the firewall, and deleting a script file suggests potential malicious activity. The svchost.exe events don't seem too suspicious here, but the cmd.exe command is a strong indicator. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of the firewall disable command and the suspicious file operations make this batch interesting. The confidence is high because disabling the firewall is a clear sign of an attack. But I should check if there's any other benign explanation. Maybe it's a legitimate script, but the deletion of the script and the firewall change are more indicative of malicious intent. Therefore, classification is INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities include attempting to disable Windows firewall (cmd.exe command: 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off'), creating files in user-specific directories, and deleting temporary script files, which are suspicious indicators of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are five entries here, all related to PowerShell processes. The command line is the same in each one: checking if a file named procdump.exe exists in a specific path. The path is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe. Wait, the path uses \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. That might be a red flag because it's trying to access a parent directory, which could be an attempt to bypass directory restrictions or access files that shouldn't be accessible.\n\nNow, procdump.exe is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals, but it's also commonly used by attackers for memory dumping. However, in this case, the command is just checking the existence of the file, not executing it. The PowerShell script is exiting 0 if the file exists, else 1. But why would someone repeatedly check for this file? Maybe they're trying to determine if procdump.exe is present before using it for some malicious activity. The fact that this check is happening multiple times might indicate that the attacker is probing the system to see if certain tools are available, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nAlso, the winlog task is 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle' which might relate to the event log provider or engine, but I'm not sure. However, the repetition of the same command across multiple events could be significant. It's possible that this is a benign script, but the use of directory traversal in the path is suspicious. The combination of repeated checks and the potential for procdump.exe being a tool of choice for malicious activities makes this interesting. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity yet, just the probing. So, I'd lean towards INTERESTING but with moderate confidence because it's not conclusive yet, but warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical PowerShell commands check for the existence of 'procdump.exe' using a path with directory traversal ('..\\\\').

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these events. The user provided a list of system logs, mostly related to PowerShell and other processes. First, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. Some entries show command lines like creating a new PSDrive with a network path, which might be an attempt to access remote systems. For example, the command \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\" suggests trying to map a network drive to a remote machine's C$ share. That's a common technique in attacks to access remote systems.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of PowerShell creating temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. While creating temporary files isn't inherently malicious, doing so repeatedly and then deleting them (as seen in one event) could be part of an attack to execute scripts or hide activities. The fact that files are created and then deleted might indicate an attempt to clean up after executing some code.\n\nAlso, there are events where PowerShell loads various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are related to .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, but the frequency might be worth noting. However, that alone isn't suspicious.\n\nOther events include whoami.exe being run multiple times, which is just checking user identity, and cmd.exe being started. These are common system tools and not inherently malicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of creating a network drive, creating and deleting temporary files, and using PowerShell for these actions could be indicative of an attacker trying to execute commands on a remote system or bypass security measures. The repeated access to the process and the use of PowerShell with network paths are red flags. \n\nEven though some activities are normal, the specific command to map a network drive and the file operations in temp directories with PowerShell might be part of a broader attack. Therefore, this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious actions like creating network drives (\\\\Target\\\\C$), writing and deleting temporary scripts in AppData\/Temp, and repeated process access attempts.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to svchost.exe performing registry operations. The task is \"Registry object added or deleted\" repeated multiple times. But svchost.exe is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious. But wait, there are 14 instances of the same event. That's a lot. Maybe it's a legitimate activity, but maybe not. I should check if there's any other event that stands out.\n\nLooking further down, there are events with command_line entries involving PowerShell. The command lines are \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Wait, that looks like someone is trying to map a network drive, possibly to a remote machine. The use of PowerShell to create a PSDrive could be part of a malicious activity, like establishing a connection to a remote system. Also, the presence of \"Target\" in the UNC path might indicate a specific target, maybe a victim machine. \n\nBut then there are also entries with \"powershell.exe & {}\" which is just an empty script block. That might be a red herring or a test. However, the fact that there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands being executed, especially with the New-PSDrive command, could be a sign of someone trying to access remote systems or exfiltrate data.\n\nAnother point is the combination of registry events and PowerShell activities. If svchost.exe is doing a lot of registry changes, and then PowerShell is used to map drives, that might be part of a larger attack. For example, modifying the registry to persist access, then using PowerShell to interact with remote systems.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Some of these events could be normal. For example, svchost.exe handling registry events as part of system services. However, the repetition of the same event 14 times might indicate something unusual. Also, the PowerShell commands are executed multiple times, which might be part of a script that's running repeatedly.\n\nAnother thing to note is the \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the winlog. These might relate to PowerShell provider events, which are part of normal operations but could be abused in attacks.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch includes multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and repeated PowerShell commands that map network drives. This could indicate an attempt to access remote systems or persist on the network. Even though svchost.exe is legitimate, the combination with the PowerShell activities raises suspicion. However, without more context, like the exact registry keys being modified or the source of the PowerShell commands, it's a bit hard to be 100% certain. But given the repetitive nature and the use of PowerShell for network drive mapping, this seems like a potential indicator of malicious activity. So, I would classify this as interesting with a confidence level around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple svchost.exe registry events combined with PowerShell commands mapping network drives (e.g., '\\\\Target\\\\C$') suggest potential lateral movement or access to remote systems.
