The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to look for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of chrome.exe and powershell.exe activity. But what's really catching my eye is the schtasks.exe entries. There are two instances where schtasks.exe is creating scheduled tasks. The first one is creating a task named \"pacote_secundario_005_OnLogon\" that runs \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" on logon. The second one is \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" running the same command on startup, and it's set to run as the system user. That's a red flag because creating a scheduled task that runs as system with a command like calc.exe (which is just a calculator) might be a sign of something malicious. Usually, attackers use scheduled tasks to persist access or execute payloads.\n\nThen, there's an entry where Calculator.exe is loaded from the System32 directory, which is normal. But the other schtasks entries are creating tasks in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory, which is where legitimate tasks are stored, but if an attacker is creating tasks there, it's suspicious. Also, the command line for schtasks includes \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" which is odd because calc.exe is a harmless application, but if it's being executed from a scheduled task, maybe it's a placeholder for something more malicious. However, in this case, the command is just launching calc.exe, which might be a test or a decoy.\n\nAnother point is the file creation by powershell.exe at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\unidade_ativo.txt\". Creating a file in the Downloads directory isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be. However, alone, it's not suspicious. \n\nThe other events involve registry changes and image loads, but those are common in normal operations. The chrome.exe processes loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are legitimate because those are part of Windows Defender. \n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious activity is the creation of scheduled tasks with schtasks.exe that run as system and execute calc.exe. While calc.exe itself isn't malicious, the context of creating a scheduled task with that command might be a sign of an attacker trying to establish persistence. However, since the command is just launching a calculator, it's possible that this is a false positive or part of a benign process. But the presence of multiple scheduled task creations and the use of the system account could indicate a potential security issue. \n\nI need to weigh whether this is enough to classify as interesting. The confidence is moderate because while the actions are suspicious, they might not be malicious on their own. However, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with system-level privileges and executing a command that's typically not used in such contexts could be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: schtasks.exe creating scheduled tasks with system-level permissions to execute calc.exe, which may indicate persistence mechanisms. PowerShell and chrome.exe also show unusual registry modifications and file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
