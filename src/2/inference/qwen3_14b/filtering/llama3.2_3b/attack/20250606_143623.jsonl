The first event stands out: someone used PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". That's a red flag because creating a service with a custom executable is often a tactic used by malware to persist on a system. Then, they started that service immediately. \n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll, mscoree.dll, and clr.dll. These are legitimate .NET components, so maybe that's just normal PowerShell operation. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory, which is common for malicious scripts to drop temporary files. However, the same file is quickly deleted, which might be an attempt to cover tracks. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple Registry value set events from services.exe and svchost.exe. Those processes are usually part of Windows' normal operations, but excessive registry changes could indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe other events involve setup.exe creating files related to Microsoft Edge. That seems legitimate, possibly part of an installation or update. But the presence of tarefa_logico.exe being loaded as part of a service might be suspicious.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's setup.exe creating files in the Program Files directory for Microsoft Edge. That seems normal, but then there are multiple entries of svchost.exe performing registry operations. Registry changes can be suspicious, especially if they're modifying key values or adding\/deleting objects. The fact that svchost.exe is involved here is a red flag because svchost is often used by legitimate system processes, but it can also be abused by malware to hide activities.\n\nThen, there are several instances of setup.exe creating files in the Windows Temp directory. The temp folder is a common place for malicious files to be stored temporarily. Also, there's a file created in the WindowsApps directory, which is usually for installed apps. However, the presence of multiple files being created here, especially with names that look like temporary installation files, might indicate an installation process, but it's worth checking if it's part of a legitimate update or something else.\n\nThe Pipe Created events related to setup.exe could be normal for some applications, but again, if there's an unusual number of pipes being created, that might be a sign of something malicious trying to communicate covertly.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple registry changes by svchost.exe, file creations in temp and system directories, and repeated activities by setup.exe. While some of these could be part of a legitimate software installation or update, the combination of these activities, especially the registry modifications and temp file creation, raises suspicion.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a mix of processes, mostly PowerShell and some others like svchost.exe and Dism.exe. The first event mentions a file created in the AppReadiness directory with a path that looks like a security identifier (S-1-5...). That might be normal, but I should check if that's a known legitimate file.\n\nThen there are several PowerShell processes. One of them runs a command that writes 'Final result: 1' to the host. That seems benign, but another PowerShell command is scanning INF files for defaultinstall sections. That could be part of a script checking for certain configurations, but maybe it's looking for something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .dll files, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1. That's a PowerShell script file in the Temp folder, which could be a red flag. Temporary files are often used by malware to execute scripts, so that's suspicious.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command that disables the Windows Defender feature using Dism. Disabling security features like Defender is a clear indicator of malicious activity. The Dism.exe events also mention creating and executing files in the Temp directory, which again points towards possible malware installation or execution.\n\nPutting this all together: the creation of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, the attempt to disable Windows Defender, and the use of Dism to modify system features are all signs of a potential attack. Even though some events are normal system activities, the combination of these actions suggests an attempt to compromise the system. The confidence is high because disabling security tools and creating scripts in temporary directories are common in malware scenarios.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands, creation of a temporary PowerShell script file, and attempt to disable Windows Defender via Dism.exe indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder, which is common for temporary files.\n\nNow, the paths include various DLLs and EXEs like DismHost.exe, DismProv.dll, etc. Some of these are standard components that Dism might use, especially during system updates or deployments. However, the presence of multiple files in the Temp directory could be a red flag. Typically, Dism might not generate so many executable files in the Temp folder during normal operations. \n\nBut wait, looking at the file names, some are .mui files, which are language-specific resource files. These are usually part of the system's localization and might be legitimate. However, the fact that all these files are being detected as executable by the rule might indicate that they're not standard. The FileExecutableDetected rule could be triggered if the files are being executed from an unexpected location or if their digital signatures are missing.\n\nAnother point is the GUID in the path. Temp folders often have such GUIDs for temporary files, but if these files are being created and executed repeatedly, it might be a sign of malicious activity. However, Dism is known to use temporary files during operations, so this could be part of a legitimate process.\n\nBut considering that all these files are being logged as detected executables, and given that Dism is typically used in controlled environments (like Windows updates or sysprep), the presence of so many files in the Temp directory might be unusual. It's possible that this is a false positive, but the combination of multiple files and the Temp location could be suspicious. However, without additional context like process arguments, user context, or other logs, it's hard to be certain. \n\nI think the classification here is on the border. The presence of multiple files in Temp by a legitimate process might not be malicious, but the fact that they're all being detected as executables could indicate something. However, since Dism is a legitimate tool, and the files could be part of its normal operations, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with medium confidence. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.6. Alternatively, if the system is not in a deployment scenario, this might be suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all related to the DismHost.exe and Dism.exe processes. The first thing I notice is that DismHost.exe is loading several DLL files from the Temp directory. The files are named things like OSProvider.dll, LogProvider.dll, and others. These all seem to be part of some kind of provider modules, maybe for DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool), which is a Windows utility.\n\nBut wait, the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from the Temp folder might be a red flag. Typically, legitimate software doesn't load a bunch of DLLs from the Temp directory, especially if they're all different and specific to DISM. Also, the names of the DLLs don't look standard. For example, I'm not sure if DISM normally uses a LogProvider.dll or an IBSProvider.dll. Maybe these are legitimate, but it's unusual.\n\nThen there are entries about Dism.exe deleting files. The files being deleted are DismProv.dll, DmiProvider.dll.mui, etc. Again, these are in the Temp directory. The deletion might be part of a normal process, like after using DISM, but combined with the loading of so many DLLs, it's a bit suspicious. \n\nI should consider if this is part of a legitimate operation. DISM is used for imaging, and during that process, it might load various providers. However, the number of DLLs loaded here seems high. Also, the Temp directory is a common place for malware to stage files, so loading multiple DLLs from there could indicate that. \n\nAnother point is that all the DLLs are from the same Temp directory path. That's a common indicator of malicious activity, as malware often uses Temp folders to store temporary files. The combination of loading multiple DLLs and then deleting them might be an attempt to hide the presence of malicious code. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that the user might be running a legitimate DISM operation, which could involve loading many DLLs. But the fact that the same process (DismHost.exe) is loading so many different providers, and the deletion of files by Dism.exe, might not be standard. \n\nI think the key here is the unusual number of DLLs being loaded from the Temp directory. While DISM does use providers, having so many different ones being loaded in a short time could be indicative of something malicious. The deletion of the files after might be an attempt to clean up, which is common in malware. \n\nSo, putting this together, the batch of events shows multiple image loads from the Temp directory by DismHost.exe and subsequent deletions by Dism.exe.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. The task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I need to parse through each entry. All the events are related to the 'Dism.exe' and 'DismHost.exe' processes. The winlog entries mention 'File Executable Detected' and 'Process Create' and 'Image loaded' tasks. The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. \n\nHmm, Dism.exe is part of the Windows Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, which is used for deploying and managing Windows images. It's a legitimate tool, but it can be abused by attackers for malicious activities. The fact that multiple DLLs are being detected as executable files in the Temp folder might be suspicious. \n\nWait, the 'File Executable Detected' rule is triggered here. Normally, this rule is for detecting when an executable is created or modified, which could indicate malware. But since these are DLLs, which are typically not executables, that's a red flag. DLLs are libraries, not standalone executables. If a DLL is being treated as an executable, that might be part of a malicious process.\n\nLooking at the process names, DismHost.exe is a child process of Dism.exe. The command line shows a GUID, which might be part of a legitimate operation, but combined with the multiple DLLs being loaded, it's possible that this is a legitimate system activity. However, the presence of so many DLLs being detected as executable in the Temp directory could indicate that someone is trying to inject code or run malicious payloads through these files. \n\nAnother point is that the same GUID is used in the path for all these files. That might be part of a temporary setup, but if these files are being created and executed by Dism, which is a system tool, it's possible that this is a legitimate process. However, the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded and detected as executable might be unusual. \n\nI should also check if the 'ImageLoad' events are normal. DismHost.exe loading DLLs from the Temp directory might be part of a legitimate deployment process, but if these DLLs are not signed or are from unknown sources, that's a problem. However, the data provided doesn't include information about the DLLs' origins or signatures. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. On one hand, the use of Dism and DismHost is legitimate. On the other, the high number of executable detections in the Temp folder, especially DLLs, is suspicious. Since the user's task is to determine if the batch is interesting, and given that the events involve multiple executable detections in a temporary directory by a system process, this might warrant further investigation. \n\nI think the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, all related to the Dism.exe process deleting various DLL files from the Temp directory. The task is to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. It's commonly used in tasks like sysprep, which prepares a Windows image for deployment. However, deleting a lot of files, especially multiple DLLs in the Temp folder, might be normal during such operations. But I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is typical for temporary files. The filenames include things like IBSProvider.dll.mui, IntlProvider.dll.mui, etc. The .mui files are Microsoft UI language files, which might be part of localization. But why are they being deleted by Dism.exe?\n\nNow, considering the number of deletions. There are 15 entries here, all from Dism.exe. That's a lot. But if Dism is running a cleanup or uninstalling something, it might delete these files. However, I should think about whether this is a normal operation or if it's a sign of something malicious. For example, if a legitimate process is deleting files, but the files are related to a known legitimate action, it's probably not a threat. But if the files are part of a critical system component or if the deletions are unusual, that could be a red flag.\n\nWait, but Dism.exe is known to handle imaging and deployment tasks. When you run sysprep, it might clean up temporary files, which could involve deleting these DLLs. Also, the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files that are deleted after use. So maybe this is just part of a normal system process.\n\nHowever, the fact that so many files are being deleted by the same process might be worth looking into. But since all the files are in the Temp directory and the process is Dism.exe, which is legitimate, it's possible that this is just part of a standard operation. Unless there's a pattern that suggests the files are not supposed to be there, but the names seem legitimate.\n\nAnother angle: are these files part of a known legitimate operation? For example, during a Windows image deployment, various providers might be used, and their temporary files could be deleted. So, if this is happening during such a process, it's normal. But if it's happening outside of that context, maybe not.\n\nBut the logs don't provide context about the system's state or other events. The justification has to be based solely on the provided data. Since all the events are about Dism.exe deleting files from Temp, which is a common place for temporary files, and Dism is a legitimate tool, this might not be suspicious. However, the high number of deletions might still be a point of interest. But I think in this case, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the process is legitimate and the files are in a temporary directory. Unless there's a known malicious use of Dism.exe deleting such files, but I'm not aware of that. So the confidence would be around 0.6, but maybe lower. Wait, but the justification needs to be concise. So, if all the deletions are from a legitimate process in a temporary directory, it's probably not interesting.

The other two events don't have process or file information, just winlog tasks related to Security Group Management and Special Logon.\n\nHmm, the PowerShell command seems suspicious. INF files are usually used for installation, and the script is checking for sections that might indicate driver or hardware installation. The use of Get-Item and Get-Content to read these files could be part of a malicious activity, maybe trying to find or modify system configurations.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a process event. The task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are PowerShell commands with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The first few entries have simple commands like Write-Host 'Final result: 1', which seems benign. But then there's a pattern where some commands are checking INF files in the Windows directory for specific sections like [defaultinstall.nt...]. \n\nWait, INF files are usually part of Windows installation and setup. The regex they're using matches sections related to different architectures (amd64, arm, etc.). The script is scanning these INF files and setting a result based on whether those sections exist. \n\nNow, why would someone do that? Maybe they're checking for the presence of certain drivers or installation configurations. But in a security context, scanning INF files could be part of a malicious activity, like looking for vulnerabilities or preparing for exploitation. However, the commands themselves don't execute any harmful actions; they're just reading files and outputting a result.\n\nBut here's the thing: even though the commands are not directly malicious, the fact that they're repeatedly checking INF files might be suspicious. Normal user activity usually doesn't involve such specific and repeated checks. Also, the use of PowerShell with Restricted ExecutionPolicy is a bit odd because Restricted is the default and doesn't allow scripts to run, but maybe the user is testing or doing some legitimate system analysis.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same command multiple times might indicate automated scanning or probing.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries that look like log entries from a Windows system, probably from something like the Windows Event Log or a security tool. Each entry has a \"process\" field with a command line, a \"winlog\" task, and a \"file\" field which is None in most cases.\n\nFirst, I notice that several entries have the same command line: \"powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}\". This seems to be creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" and then starting that service. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" might be a red flag, especially if it's not a known service on the system. The path \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" is in a directory that's not typical for system services, which might indicate a malicious file.\n\nThen there are entries with the command line \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\". This seems less suspicious, but the repeated entries might be part of a test or a script that's being run multiple times. However, the ExecutionPolicy being Restricted might be a way to bypass certain restrictions, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most are \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". \"Provider Lifecycle\" might relate to the Windows Event Log providers, and \"Engine Lifecycle\" could be part of the Windows Defender or another security engine. The repetition of the same command line in multiple entries could indicate that the process is being monitored or logged multiple times, perhaps due to the service starting and stopping, or the script being executed repeatedly.\n\nThe presence of \"tarefa_logico.exe\" in a non-standard directory is concerning. Typically, legitimate services are installed in directories like C:\\Program Files or C:\\Windows\\System32. The use of \"unidade_logico\" (which might be a Portuguese term for \"logical unit\") in the path could be a sign of a custom or malicious installation. Also, creating a service via PowerShell with a custom executable might be part of a persistence mechanism, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the command line uses the & operator to chain two commands: creating the service and starting it. This is a common technique in PowerShell scripts to execute multiple commands in sequence. However, the fact that this is being done in a single command line might be part of an automated process or a script that's trying to install and activate a service without user interaction, which could be suspicious.\n\nThe \"Final result: 1\" output from the Write-Host command might be a placeholder or a test message, but the number 1 could be significant. In some contexts, 1 might indicate success, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the repetition of this command might suggest that this is part of a test or a script that's being run to check if the service is functioning correctly.\n\nI should also check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a legitimate file. If it's not present in the system's usual directories or if there's no record of it being installed by the user, that's a red flag. Additionally, the name \"tarefa_logico\" translates to \"logical task\" in Portuguese, which might be a hint, but it's not enough to confirm malicious intent on its own.\n\nAnother aspect is the use of PowerShell with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. Normally, Restricted is the default policy that prevents scripts from running unless they're signed or come from a trusted location. However, if the user is running this command, they might have bypassed the execution policy, which could be a sign of a compromised system or an attempt to execute a script that isn't trusted.\n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious part is the creation of the \"objeto_ativo\" service with an executable in an unusual directory. This could be an attempt to install a backdoor or a persistent malware component. The repeated logging of the same process might be due to the service being started multiple times or the system monitoring the process. The \"Final result: 1\" might be a test output, but without more context, it's hard to determine its significance.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these logs are from a security tool or a monitoring system, and the repetition could be part of the tool's logging mechanism. However, the presence of the service creation and the non-standard executable path still raises concerns. It's possible that the system is being monitored, and these entries are part of a legitimate process, but the lack of information about the service and the file makes it hard to confirm.\n\nIn summary, the key points of concern are:\n1. The creation of a new service with a non-standard executable path.\n2. The repetition of the same command line in multiple log entries.\n3. The use of PowerShell to execute commands that could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n4. The \"Final result: 1\" output, which might be a test or a placeholder.\n\nTo further investigate, I would check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" exists in the specified path, verify its digital signature, and look for any other related processes or files that might indicate malicious activity. Additionally, checking the system's event logs for any errors or warnings related to the service creation could provide more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate potential malicious activity on a Windows system, with several suspicious patterns observed. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Malicious Service Creation**\n- **Command Line**:  \n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" ; Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n  ```\n  - **Key Concerns**:\n    - **Service Name**: `\"objeto_ativo\"` (Portuguese for \"active object\") is not a standard Windows service. This is a red flag for potential malware persistence.\n    - **Binary Path**: `\"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"` is in an unusual directory (`unidade_logico`), not typical for legitimate system services. This suggests a custom or malicious executable.\n    - **Persistence Mechanism**: The script creates and starts a service, which is a common technique used by malware to maintain access post-exploitation.\n\n### **2. Repeated Execution of the Same Command**\n- The same PowerShell command is logged multiple times, possibly indicating:\n  - **Automated Scripting**: The script may be part of a test or a malicious process that repeatedly executes to ensure persistence.\n  - **Monitoring or Logging**: Repeated logs might indicate the system is being monitored, but the lack of context (e.g., service startup\/shutdown) raises concerns.\n\n### **3. \"Final Result: 1\" Output**\n- **Command Line**:  \n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\n  ```\n  - **Possible Implications**:\n    - The `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` might be bypassed (e.g., via `Set-ExecutionPolicy`), allowing scripts to run despite default restrictions.\n    - The output `\"Final result: 1\"` could indicate a test or placeholder message, but the number \"1\" might be a success flag in the attacker's context. Further investigation is needed to determine its significance.\n\n### **4. Winlog Tasks**\n- **\"Provider Lifecycle\"** and **\"Engine Lifecycle\"** tasks are logged, which relate to Windows Event Log providers and security engines (e.g., Windows Defender). These logs may be from a monitoring tool, but the repeated service creation remains suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Verify the Executable**:\n   - Check if `tarefa_logico.exe` exists at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - Analyze the file using tools like **VirusTotal**, **PEiD**, or **Malware Analysis Platforms** to confirm if it's malicious.\n   - Check the file's digital signature (if any) to identify the publisher.\n\n2. **Check System Logs**:\n   - Look for additional logs related to the `\"objeto_ativo\"` service (e.g., service startup, errors, or network activity).\n   - Investigate the source of the PowerShell command (e.g., user account, remote execution).\n\n3. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/antimalware tools.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Sysinternals Suite** to monitor the service's behavior.\n\n4. **Review User Activity**:\n   - Determine which user account executed the PowerShell commands.\n   - Check for unauthorized access or lateral movement indicators.\n\n5. **Network Traffic Analysis**:\n   - Monitor if `tarefa_logico.exe` communicates with external IPs or domains, which could indicate C2 (Command and Control) activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs suggest a **malicious attempt to install a persistent service** (`objeto_ativo`) with an executable in a non-standard directory. This aligns with common malware tactics. Immediate action is required to investigate the file, isolate the system if compromised, and remove the malicious service."}
