The command lines show that they're creating scheduled tasks with actions that execute calc.exe. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running calc.exe under admin rights at logon isn't normal. Also, there are multiple attempts to register scheduled tasks with different names like 'entrada_ativo', 'entrada_temporario', etc. The other logs mention image loads related to .NET assemblies, which might be part of the PowerShell execution. However, there are also entries about chrome.exe and some remote command executions, but those don't seem as suspicious. The repeated scheduled task creation with admin privileges suggests someone is trying to set up persistent access. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate tool, the context here is concerning. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious files, but the pattern of scheduled tasks with high privileges is enough to flag this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators, RunLevel Highest) that execute calc.exe at user logon.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user wants me to analyze these log entries and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each line step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: process is None, winlog says 'Execute a Remote Command', and file is None. That seems a bit odd. Usually, if a remote command is executed, there should be some process involved. Maybe this is a placeholder or an error? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, the second event is powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a legitimate path for PowerShell profiles, but creating a file there might be normal. However, sometimes attackers use such directories to hide malicious scripts. Hmm.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe setting a registry value. Registry changes can be benign, but if done by PowerShell, it might be part of a configuration or could be malicious. Need to check other events for context.\n\nFourth event: conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is a Windows process related to console windows. Registry changes here might be normal, but again, depends on the context. Not sure yet.\n\nFifth event: chrome.exe loading amsi.dll from System32. AMSI is part of Windows' anti-malware system. Loading it normally is okay, but if it's being tampered with, that's a red flag. But the path is correct here. Maybe a false positive?\n\nSixth event: chrome.exe setting a registry value. Again, registry changes by Chrome could be part of updates or extensions. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nSeventh event: chrome.exe making a DNS query. DNS queries themselves are normal, but if it's querying unusual domains, that's bad. However, the log doesn't specify the domain, so can't tell.\n\nEighth event: powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. The name is in Portuguese, which might be benign, but the presence of a file created by PowerShell could be part of normal user activity or something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple events involving PowerShell and registry changes, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. The creation of files in certain directories and registry modifications could be part of a script or malware. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity like accessing suspicious domains, executing unknown binaries, or unusual process behaviors. The DNS query is missing details, and the amsi.dll load seems legitimate.\n\nBut the presence of multiple PowerShell activities and registry changes might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or execute commands remotely. However, without more evidence like unexpected network traffic, unusual file modifications, or known malicious indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. The classification might lean towards \"interesting\" because of the combination of events, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the confidence is moderate, around 0.6, because there's enough to warrant further investigation but not conclusive proof of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating files and modifying registry values, which could indicate script-based activities. The 'Execute a Remote Command' event and file creation in user-specific directories may suggest potential lateral movement or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
