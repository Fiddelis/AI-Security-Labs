That's a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes attackers use scheduled tasks for persistence. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is normal for checking user context, but maybe part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking further, there's a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That's suspicious because deleting processes can be part of covering tracks. Also, multiple instances of cmd.exe and powershell.exe being used with commands like net user \/del to delete user accounts. That's a red flag because deleting user accounts could be an attempt to remove access or hide malicious activities.\n\nThe presence of WMIC.exe and the use of registry value sets might indicate someone is modifying system settings or trying to escalate privileges. Also, the command lines have some obfuscation with \/c and redirection to nul, which is common in attacks to avoid logging. \n\nThere are multiple process creations with cmd and powershell, which are often used by attackers. The repeated use of 'net user \/del' suggests an attempt to remove user accounts, possibly to eliminate evidence or take control. The combination of these actions—deleting processes, modifying the registry, and deleting user accounts—points toward a coordinated malicious activity rather than normal system behavior. \n\nHowever, some entries are just normal processes like whoami.exe.

First, I'll go through each event and note what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first entry, it's cmd.exe with a registry value set. Not sure yet. Then there's sc.exe deleting a service called win32times. That might be suspicious because deleting a service could be part of a malicious activity. Next, services.exe and whoami.exe are mentioned. Whoami.exe is usually used to get user info, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other actions might be.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe again, with some command lines that involve deleting files. The file paths in the delete events are in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to hide files. Also, the command_line for one cmd.exe includes deleting temporary files, which could be part of cleaning up after an attack.\n\nThere are multiple entries about powershell.exe loading images, which is normal, but the specific DLLs loaded might be relevant. However, the paths here seem to be standard system DLLs, so maybe not. The File Delete logged events for PowerShell scripts in the Temp folder could indicate that someone is trying to remove evidence. \n\nAlso, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events for PowerShell might be normal, but the multiple entries could indicate something unusual. The deletion of the __PSScriptPolicyTest file might be part of a script that's been executed and is being cleaned up.\n\nPutting it all together: deleting a service, deleting temporary files, and multiple process creations and deletions might indicate an attacker trying to remove traces of their activity. However, some of these actions could be legitimate. But the combination of deleting a service, using cmd and PowerShell to delete files in Temp, and the presence of multiple process events might be signs of malicious activity. So I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of a service (win32times), file deletions in temporary directories, and repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe executions with potential cleanup commands.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is running a command that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems suspicious because searching for passwords in files might indicate an attempt to find sensitive information. The command line is a bit messy with escaped characters, but the intent is clear.\n\nThen there are multiple events of 'Image loaded' for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. Loading .NET assemblies isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with other activities, it could be part of a malicious process. However, some of these DLLs are legitimate system components, so I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be related to PowerShell's execution policies or other internal processes. However, the repetition could indicate some kind of looping or persistent activity.\n\nLooking at the command line again, the use of 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for passwords is a red flag. It's possible that an attacker is trying to extract credentials from the system. The fact that this command is executed multiple times might suggest that the attacker is trying to ensure they capture any passwords, possibly in different directories or file types.\n\nThe presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded could be a sign that the attacker is trying to bypass or interact with the antivirus, but it's also possible that these are legitimate processes. However, when combined with the other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe 'calc.exe' event loading urlmon.dll seems normal, but if there were other unusual activities around that time, it might be a sign of something else. However, in this batch, it's just a single event and not necessarily a threat on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the loading of various DLLs could indicate an attempt to extract sensitive information. The confidence level is high enough to warrant further investigation, but not 100% certain. There's enough suspicious activity here to classify this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for 'password' in files, combined with temporary file creation\/deletion and loading of .NET and Windows Defender DLLs, suggests potential credential harvesting or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there's a PowerShell process creating files in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be normal, but then there's a PowerShell command that's searching for files with passwords in various formats. The command line shows \"findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls\" and \"select-string -Pattern password\". That seems suspicious because it's looking for sensitive information like passwords in different file types. Maybe someone is trying to find credentials on the system?\n\nThen there are multiple DNS queries from Chrome, which could be normal browsing, but not necessarily suspicious. However, there's also a Chrome process loading amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If that's being loaded normally, it's okay, but if there's something unusual about it, maybe not. But I don't see anything wrong here yet.\n\nNext, there are several file creations by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration changes, but again, not obviously malicious. However, the repetition of the same file path being created multiple times might be worth noting, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe process, which just gets the user context. That's a standard command, so probably not an issue. The cmd.exe process is deleting scheduled tasks with names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleaning up after an attack, or maybe just normal maintenance. But the fact that they're being deleted might be a red flag if they were previously malicious.\n\nThe schtasks.exe processes are also deleting tasks, which could be part of the same activity. The command line for schtasks shows deleting tasks named with \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" and \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". These names are a bit generic, but the deletion might indicate that someone is trying to remove traces of scheduled tasks that could have been used for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell command searching for passwords is a potential indicator of data exfiltration or credential harvesting. The deletion of scheduled tasks might be an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity. The multiple file creations and process executions might be part of a larger attack chain. However, some of these events could be benign, like normal log shipping or user activities. But the combination of searching for passwords and deleting scheduled tasks raises suspicion. I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, so the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell searching for password-related files, deletion of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names, and repeated file creation events that may indicate data exfiltration or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first one is about Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, so that might be normal. But maybe there's something else here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe created a new .yml file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file could be part of its setup. But the file path is in the Downloads folder, which might be less suspicious unless it's part of an installation.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious tasks. But without more context, like script execution or unusual commands, it's hard to tell. The file is None here, so maybe it's just accessing a process, not a file.\n\nWhoami.exe is a standard tool for checking user context. The ProcessCreate event here seems normal. No signs of abuse here.\n\nChrome.exe has a couple of DNS queries and a network connection. Multiple DNS queries could be normal for browsing, but if they're going to unusual domains, that's a red flag. However, the events don't specify the domains, so I can't tell from this data alone.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious thing might be the PowerShell event, but without more info, it's not conclusive. The other events are either normal system activities or part of legitimate software operations. There's no clear evidence of malicious behavior here. So maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events represent normal system activity (Calculator, Chrome, whoami) and legitimate operations (winlogbeat config creation). No suspicious patterns like unexpected process interactions, malicious file access, or anomalous network behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
