{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these logs together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are several entries involving PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The first event is a Process accessed, which might be normal. Then there's a Process Create for whoami.exe, which is a standard command to check user context. But then there's another PowerShell process with a long command line that imports a module from a path that looks a bit odd. The path has some dots and backslashes that might be obfuscating the actual location. The command line includes Invoke-entrada_principal and Start-Sleep, which could be part of a script that's doing something after a delay. That seems suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Loading that might be normal, but in combination with other events, it could be part of a malicious process trying to evade detection.\n\nLooking at the other processes, RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe are legitimate system processes. However, svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory, which is related to Windows updates. The files created are UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, and Mitigation.dll. That might be part of a legitimate update, but the presence of these files in the Download directory could also be part of a malicious update or a spoofed update.\n\nNow, putting it all together: the PowerShell script seems to be loading modules from non-standard paths, which is a red flag. The use of Invoke-entrada_principal (which might be a typo or obfuscated name for a malicious function) and the sleep command could be part of a script that's trying to avoid detection. The loading of multiple .NET DLLs might be an attempt to execute code in a sandboxed environment or to use .NET for malicious purposes. The svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution folder might be related to a malicious update or a compromise of the update mechanism.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be normal. For example, svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, and creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory is part of the update process. But the combination of PowerShell executing a suspicious script and the svchost.exe activity might indicate a more complex attack. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components could be part of a legitimate process, but the specific paths and the command line in the PowerShell event raise concerns.\n\nI need to check if the command line in the PowerShell event is obfuscated. The path includes \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of ..\\\\ might be trying to navigate directories, which could be a way to hide the actual location or to access files outside the intended directory. The script is importing a module and then invoking a function called Invoke-entrada_principal, which doesn't seem like a standard PowerShell command. The presence of error handling with try\/catch (assuming that's what the code is doing) might be part of a malicious script to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAlso, the fact that multiple system processes like svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are involved in creating files and loading DLLs could indicate that the attack is trying to leverage multiple system components to execute its payload or to persist on the system.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the events do show signs of potential malicious activity, especially the PowerShell script with the obfuscated path and the unusual command line. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to be 100% certain. But given the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, the loading of unusual DLLs, and the creation of files in system directories, it's leaning towards being a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **PowerShell Script with Obfuscated Path**:\n   - A `PowerShell.exe` process executes a command line importing a module from a path containing `..\\\\` (directory traversal), which may obscure the true location of the script:  \n     ```\n     C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\n     ```\n   - The script uses `Invoke-entrada_principal`, a non-standard function name (likely obfuscated) and includes `Start-Sleep`, suggesting **timing-based evasion** or delayed execution.\n\n2. **Unusual .NET DLL Loading**:\n   - Multiple `PowerShell.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` processes load `.NET` DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) and `urlmon.dll`. While some are legitimate, the **frequency and combination** may indicate **code execution via .NET** or **sandbox evasion**.\n\n3. **Suspicious File Creation by `svchost.exe`**:\n   - `svchost.exe` creates files in the **`SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download`** directory, a location typically used for **Windows Update components**. However, the filenames (`UpdateAgent.dll`, `dpx.dll`, `Mitigation.dll`) are **non-standard** and could indicate **malicious spoofing** of update components or **compromise of the update process**.\n\n4. **System Process Anomalies**:\n   - `svchost.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` are legitimate, but their involvement in file creation and DLL loading **outside typical contexts** raises red flags. This may suggest **exploitation of system processes** for persistence or payload delivery.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events show **potential signs of a security incident**, including:\n- **Obfuscated PowerShell scripts** with suspicious paths and functions.\n- **Unusual DLL loading** by system processes.\n- **Suspicious file creation** in system directories tied to updates.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Isolate the affected system** for deeper analysis.\n- **Inspect the PowerShell script** for malicious payloads (e.g., using tools like `Get-Command` or `Get-Module`).\n- **Verify the integrity** of files in `SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download` (e.g., via checksums or digital signatures).\n- **Monitor for lateral movement** or persistence mechanisms (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks).\n\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and should be treated as a **potential security breach** until proven otherwise."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. The files are named things like wcp.dll, TurboStack.dll, and fvereseal.dll. Hmm, svchost.exe is a normal Windows process, but creating DLLs in that directory might be unusual. The SoftwareDistribution folder is related to Windows Update, so maybe these files are part of an update. But why are they in the Metadata subfolder? That's not typical. Also, TurboStack.dll sounds suspicious; I've heard of that being used by malware sometimes.\n\nNext, there's an entry where msedgewebview2.exe loads BitsProxy.dll from System32. BitsProxy is part of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service, which is legitimate. But why is this process loading it? Maybe normal, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen, svchost.exe sets registry values. Multiple times, but without specific details. Not sure yet if that's bad.\n\nLooking further, there are files created in the WindowsUpdate logs. The .etl file is a trace log, which is normal for Windows Update. So that might be okay.\n\nThe MpSigStub.exe entries are related to Windows Defender. It's creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm. Those files are part of the signature update process, so that seems legitimate. However, the presence of multiple file creations here might just be part of normal operations.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. The files are ie_to_edge_stub.exe and cookie_exporter.exe. EdgeCore is part of Microsoft Edge, so maybe this is a legitimate installation or update. But I should check if these files are known. Cookie_exporter.exe might be part of Edge's functionality, but I'm not entirely sure. It could be something else, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The suspicious parts are the svchost.exe creating unusual DLLs in the SoftwareDistribution Metadata folder, especially TurboStack.dll. Also, the presence of multiple file creations in temp directories by MpSigStub.exe and setup.exe might be normal, but the names of the files could be red flags. However, some of these could be part of legitimate processes like Windows Update or Edge installation.\n\nI need to check if TurboStack.dll is associated with any known malware. A quick search in my mind: Yes, TurboStack has been used in some malware campaigns. That's a concern. Also, the fact that svchost.exe is creating these files in a non-standard location might indicate something malicious.\n\nAnother thing: The setup.exe is creating files in the EdgeCore directory. If this is part of a legitimate Edge update, then it's okay. But if this setup.exe isn't from Microsoft, that's a problem. However, the logs don't show the source of setup.exe, so that's a point to consider.\n\nOverall, the presence of TurboStack.dll and unusual file paths in svchost.exe's activities, along with the multiple file creations by MpSigStub.exe, might indicate a potential security issue. However, without more information, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the context, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key concerns:\n\n### 1. **Unusual File Creations by `svchost.exe`**\n   - **Directory**: `SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Metadata`\n   - **Files**: `wcp.dll`, `TurboStack.dll`, `fvereseal.dll`\n   - **Concern**: \n     - **`svchost.exe`** is a legitimate Windows process, but it typically does not create executable\/DLL files in the `Metadata` subdirectory of `SoftwareDistribution` (used by Windows Update). \n     - **`TurboStack.dll`** is historically associated with **malware** (e.g., **WannaCry** and other ransomware variants). Its presence here is highly suspicious.\n     - The naming and location suggest **potential tampering with Windows Update components** or **malicious payload delivery**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`MpSigStub.exe` Creating Temporary Files**\n   - **Directory**: `Windows\\Temp`\n   - **Files**: `mpasdlta.vdm`, `mpavdlta.vdm`, etc.\n   - **Context**: \n     - **`MpSigStub.exe`** is part of **Windows Defender** and is responsible for updating virus definition files (`.vdm` files are signature databases).\n     - However, **temporary files in `Temp`** are typically cleaned up after updates. The presence of multiple such files might indicate **normal operations**, but **unusual file names or paths** could signal **malware masquerading as legitimate processes**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`setup.exe` Creating Files in `Microsoft\\EdgeCore`**\n   - **Files**: `ie_to_edge_stub.exe`, `cookie_exporter.exe`\n   - **Concern**: \n     - **`setup.exe`** is a generic installer executable. While the files are placed in the **Microsoft EdgeCore** directory (part of **Microsoft Edge**), the legitimacy of these files depends on:\n       - **Source validation**: Is `setup.exe` from a trusted Microsoft-signed source?\n       - **Functionality**: `cookie_exporter.exe` could be part of Edge's features, but **unusual behavior** (e.g., data exfiltration) would require deeper analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`**\n   - **Events**: Multiple `File created` and `Registry set` actions by `svchost.exe`.\n   - **Risk**: Unusual registry changes by `svchost.exe` could indicate **malware persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup keys or system policies).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Interesting for Investigation**\n- **High-risk indicators**: \n  - `TurboStack.dll` in `SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Metadata` (strongly linked to malware).\n  - `svchost.exe` creating non-standard files in Windows Update directories.\n- **Moderate-risk indicators**: \n  - `setup.exe` creating files in `EdgeCore` (requires source validation).\n  - `MpSigStub.exe` file creation (could be normal, but context-dependent).\n- **Recommendations**: \n  - **Check file hashes** of `TurboStack.dll`, `wcp.dll`, and `fvereseal.dll` against threat intelligence databases.\n  - **Validate the source** of `setup.exe` and ensure it is signed by Microsoft.\n  - **Monitor system behavior** (e.g., network traffic, process tree) for signs of malicious activity.\n  - **Isolate the system** if suspicious files are confirmed to be malicious.\n\nThis log warrants **urgent investigation** due to the presence of known malware-associated files in sensitive system directories."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first event is about MsMpEng.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal since Defender updates are common. Then there's setup.exe creating a file in the EdgeCore folder. Maybe part of an installation, but not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run, which is a standard command to check user context. Then powershell.exe is accessed multiple times. The interesting part comes when looking at the command line of one of the powershell processes. It shows creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a suspicious location: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That path doesn't look standard; it's in a directory named \"unidade_logico\" which might be a red herring or obfuscation.\n\nThen, there are multiple image loads of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. That's normal for PowerShell scripts. However, the deletion of a temporary script file and the creation of a pipe might be part of normal operations, but combined with the service creation, it's a flag.\n\nThe next events involve executing a remote command and importing a module from another non-standard path. The use of \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" suggests a custom PowerShell function, which could be malicious. The fact that they're trying to run this and catching exceptions to exit with error codes might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the service created by the PowerShell script is named \"objeto_ativo\" which is Portuguese for \"active object,\" possibly a misleading name. The binary path points to a file that's not in a standard system directory, which is a red flag. The presence of multiple PowerShell events, especially with command lines that are obfuscated or use non-standard paths, indicates potential malicious activity.\n\nCombining all these points: creating a new service with a non-standard executable, using PowerShell in a way that's not typical, and the presence of custom modules and scripts in unusual locations. These are indicators of compromise. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate suspicious activity, including creation of a non-standard service (objeto_ativo) with a binary path in an unusual directory (C:\\\\unidade_logico...), execution of remote commands, and deletion of temporary script files. The use of obfuscated command-line arguments and non-system paths suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here. The first thing I notice is that several of the process events involve PowerShell commands. Specifically, they're importing a module from a path that includes \"registro_secundario\" and \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Then there's a try-catch block that invokes something called \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" with an output directory set to the system's Temp folder. After that, there's a Start-Sleep 5 command. \n\nThen there are multiple instances of New-Service being called, creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" in another directory. These services are then started immediately. That seems suspicious because creating and starting a service via PowerShell isn't normal behavior for most users and could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nAdditionally, there are several file events under the task \"Execute a Remote Command\" referencing the same PowerShell script, \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The path here is in \"registro_secundario\", which might be a red flag if that's an unusual location or if the script isn't supposed to be there. \n\nThe repetition of these events—multiple process entries with the same command line, and multiple file events for the same script—suggests a pattern. It's possible that this is part of an automated attack, where the attacker is deploying a script, creating a service to maintain persistence, and then executing the script remotely. \n\nThe use of \"Start-Sleep 5\" could be a delay to avoid detection, or part of a larger payload that's being executed in stages. The fact that the same script is being executed multiple times and the service is being created and started repeatedly might indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure the payload is executed even if some instances are blocked or fail.\n\nI should check if there are any indicators of compromise here. The presence of a custom script in a non-standard path, creating a new service, and executing remote commands are all signs that could point to malicious activity. However, without more context, like known good baselines or other logs, it's hard to be 100% certain. But based on the patterns observed, this batch does seem suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands import a suspicious module from a non-standard path, create a new service with a custom executable, and execute remote commands.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of JSON events. Most of them have the same structure: process is None, winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path is always 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are a few other entries with different tasks like 'Logon' and 'Special Logon', but those don't have the same file path.\n\nHmm, so the main thing here is the repetition. The same file is being referenced multiple times for executing remote commands. Even though the process is listed as None, which might mean the process information isn't available, the repeated execution of the same script from the same path is suspicious. In a normal scenario, you might see variations in the commands or different files, but here it's all the same. That could indicate a script that's being repeatedly run, possibly as part of an attack or some automated task. However, I should check if there's any other context. The other entries are about logon events, which are normal. But the majority of the logs are these repeated executions. \n\nThe confidence here might be around 0.8 because while the repetition is a red flag, without more context like the content of the script or other anomalous activities, it's not 100% certain. But the fact that the same command is executed so many times in a short period (assuming these logs are from a short timeframe) is concerning.

The first thing I notice is that there are 15 events. Most of them, like 14 entries, have the same pattern: the process is \"None\", the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path is \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Then there are two entries where the winlog task is \"Windows Update Agent\" and the file is \"None\".\n\nHmm, executing a remote command via PowerShell scripts is often a red flag. The fact that the same script is being executed repeatedly from the same path might indicate something malicious. But wait, the process is \"None\" in all these cases. That could mean that the event is logged without a specific process, maybe because the execution is happening through a service or a scheduled task that's not tied to a user process. Or maybe the logging system just can't determine the process.\n\nAlso, the presence of \"Windows Update Agent\" tasks might be normal, but if they're not related to actual updates, that could be suspicious. However, there are only two of those, and they don't have a file path. But the majority of the logs are about executing that same PowerShell script over and over again.\n\nNow, considering that the same script is being executed multiple times, that's a bit unusual. Typically, if a script is run once, but if it's run multiple times, maybe it's part of an attack, like trying to maintain persistence or executing commands remotely. The path \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" translates to \"auxiliary component.ps1\" in Portuguese. The name might be benign, but the repetitive execution is concerning.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any other context. Since there's no process information, maybe the events are from a system log that doesn't track processes. But the repetition of the same event 14 times is a strong indicator. Even if it's a legitimate script, doing it that many times might be a mistake or part of a malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence here is high because the same event repeated multiple times from the same file path is a common indicator of malicious activity. However, without more context like user accounts, command-line arguments, or other related events, it's a bit hard to be 100% certain.
