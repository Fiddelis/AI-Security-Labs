SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So maybe it's related to some legitimate Office functionality. But why are there so many files being created? The same file paths are repeated, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_4dd86f6b38e03fc03eecefd5fa19f188.js\" appearing twice. That might indicate that the process is creating multiple copies, which could be unusual.\n\nWait, but maybe these are part of an update or some package installation. However, the fact that all the files are JavaScript and named with hashes might be a red flag. Malicious scripts sometimes use obfuscation with random names. Also, the path is in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory, which is a common place for legitimate Office components, but also a target for malware.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the Office Deployment Tool or Click-to-Run.

If this were a normal installation, there might be more varied processes involved, like setup or installer executables. But here, it's all SDXHelper.exe, which could be part of a legitimate process, but the repetition and the nature of the files might still be suspicious.\n\nI'm not seeing any obvious signs of compromise, like unexpected network activity or access to sensitive files. But the sheer number of files being created in a short period might be indicative of something. However, without more context, like other events or process behavior, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering the information given, the files are in a legitimate directory, created by a known process, but the pattern of creation might be unusual.

The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. There are multiple entries for the same file paths, which might indicate that the files are being created multiple times, maybe as part of an installation or update process. However, the repetition could also be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there's one event where the process is null and the task is \"Security Group Management\". That seems out of place because the rest are file creation events. But maybe that's a normal system event? Not sure yet.\n\nAnother event mentions chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll, which is a legitimate system DLL. That seems normal, so probably not suspicious.\n\nNow, considering the files created by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office solution, right? So maybe these files are part of a legitimate Office update or package. But the fact that so many files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory might be part of a setup process. However, the names of the files include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", which could be related to the AI Copilot feature in Office. If this is a new feature, maybe it's legitimate. But if the user didn't install anything related to AI Copilot, this might be unexpected.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The key here is whether there's any indication of malicious activity. The events don't show any obvious signs like access to sensitive files, network connections, or unusual processes. All the file creations are in a standard directory for Office packages. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a sign of something wrong, like a loop or an attempt to overwrite files. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlso, the presence of a Security Group Management event might be unrelated, but it's worth noting. However, since there's only one such event and no other related logs, it's probably not significant.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch might not be interesting unless there's more context. The events could be part of a legitimate Office update. However, the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe might warrant further investigation. But without additional suspicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. I think the confidence here is moderate. Maybe around 0.6. The justification would be that multiple files are created by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, which could be normal, but the repetition and the lack of other suspicious activities make it uncertain.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of a package, maybe some localization files given the \"-strings.min\" in the name.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office, right? I remember that Office uses various helper processes for installation or updates. Creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be part of deploying add-ins or updates. However, the fact that there are so many files being created here could be a red flag. But wait, maybe it's just a large update with multiple files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the same directory under the user's AppData. That seems legitimate for user-specific installations. But I should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create so many files in that location. Also, the filenames have hashes in them, which might be part of versioning or unique identifiers for different packages. However, if this is part of a legitimate Office update, it's possible that multiple files are being generated as part of the process.\n\nBut here's a thought: sometimes malware uses legitimate-sounding processes to drop files. However, SDXHelper.exe is a known process, so unless there's other suspicious activity, like unusual network traffic or other processes, this might be normal. The logs don't show any other events, just these file creations. \n\nAnother angle: the same files are being created multiple times. For example, the entry with \"70e3fb050422d57503bf92969ce97c6d.js\" appears twice. That might indicate a retry or a problem, but it could also be part of a normal installation process. However, if the system is trying to create the same file repeatedly, that might be an issue. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since all the events are related to a known process in a typical directory, and there's no obvious malicious activity, the confidence might be lower. But the repetition of the same files could raise some flags. However, given that the justification is based on the entire batch, and there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior, it's probably not interesting. But I need to check if there's any other indicators I'm missing.\n\nWait, the files are all JavaScript files. If they were executable files, that would be more suspicious, but JavaScript is commonly used for web-based stuff. However, in the context of Office, maybe they're part of some add-in or localization files. Since the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, this might be part of a legitimate update or installation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the events are all related to a known process creating files in a legitimate directory. The repetition of files might be normal for an installation. There's no clear sign of malicious activity. Therefore, the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, as there's no obvious threat, but the repetition could be worth noting.

From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the setup and deployment of Office solutions. So creating files in the SolutionPackages directory under AppData seems normal for such a process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to OfflineFiles within the SolutionPackages. These are likely cached or packaged resources for an Office add-in. The repeated creation of similar files with different hash suffixes might be part of installing or updating the package. However, the same file being created multiple times could be a red flag. But wait, looking at the entries, some files are created more than once. For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_c085e2192b79296f08d5f730fbea99a9.js appears twice. But maybe that's just a duplication in the log or part of the installation process.\n\nHowever, the names of the files include \"officeaicopilot-strings\", which might relate to the Office AI Copilot feature. If this is a legitimate feature, then the activity is normal. But if the files are being created by a malicious process masquerading as SDXHelper.exe, that's a problem. However, the process name is correct, so unless there's a compromise where the legitimate process is being used to drop malicious files, which isn't indicated here.\n\nAnother point is the use of the FileCreate rule. If the rule is triggered, it's part of the monitoring system's detection. But if the files are legitimate, then it's just normal activity. The absence of other suspicious events like process injections, network activity, or unauthorized access suggests that this might be benign.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min.js and various language-specific ui-strings-json files. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages with different hashes in the folder names. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, especially for handling add-ins or solutions. However, the creation of multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory might be unusual. Typically, these directories are used for storing package resources, but the sheer number of files created here could indicate something out of the ordinary. \n\nLooking at the other processes, there's EXCEL.EXE opening a file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and loading some system DLLs like mscoree.dll and urlmon.dll. Those DLLs are legitimate system components, so that's probably normal. There's also svchost.exe modifying a registry value, which is common for Windows services. The user account management event doesn't seem suspicious either.\n\nBut the key point here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. Even though the process is legitimate, the frequency and the nature of the files (JavaScript files in a SolutionPackages folder) might be indicative of malicious activity. Malware sometimes uses legitimate processes to drop files in expected locations to avoid detection. However, I should check if this is a known behavior. \n\nWait, the filenames include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" which might be related to Office Add-ins.

The logs don't show any direct malicious activity like network connections or unusual commands. The files are being created in a legitimate directory, and the processes involved are mostly standard. However, the high number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe might be worth investigating further. \n\nSo, I think this is a borderline case.

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first entry: chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll. Hmm, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows system file, part of the URLMon component. So that's probably normal. But maybe if it's being loaded from an unexpected location? Wait, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct path. So that seems okay.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are officeaicopilot-strings.min...js. These look like JavaScript files, possibly part of some Office add-in or solution. But why so many of them? There are multiple entries with SDXHelper.exe creating these files. Also, the same file is created multiple times, like the one with min_f1fc99c544361fcf7994b31d22390d2f.js appears twice. Maybe that's a red flag? Repeated file creation could indicate some kind of activity, but I need to check if it's legitimate.\n\nThen, chrome.exe setting registry values. But there's no specific detail about which registry keys are being modified. Without more info, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. Maybe benign, like changing some settings.\n\nAnother entry: chrome.exe creating a Zone.Identifier stream for a downloaded Excel file. That's normal. When you download a file, Windows adds a Zone.Identifier to mark it as coming from the internet, which triggers the \"Downloaded from the internet\" warning. So that's expected behavior.\n\nBut looking back at the SDXHelper.exe activity, creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages folder. Microsoft Office sometimes uses such directories for add-ins, but the repetition might be suspicious. Also, the filenames have hashes in them, which could be part of a legitimate process, but maybe not. If these files are being created by a process that's not typically associated with Office, that's a problem. However, SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office, part of the Office Deployment Tool or something similar. So maybe that's normal.\n\nWait, but why so many files? The same file is created multiple times. Maybe it's a benign process, but the high volume could be worth investigating. However, without more context, like if the files are being executed or if there's other suspicious activity, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point: all the events are from either chrome.exe or SDXHelper.exe. Chrome is a common browser, so some activity is expected. SDXHelper.exe is related to Office, so the file creations there might be part of an Office update or add-in installation.\n\nThe only other thing is the registry changes by chrome.exe, but again, without knowing which keys, it's hard to assess. Maybe the user is just changing some settings, which is normal.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of the events seem to be legitimate. The repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe might be part of a normal process, especially if it's related to Office. The Zone.Identifier files are normal for downloaded files. However, the high number of file creations could be a sign of something, but without more context, it's not conclusive. I think this might be a false positive, or maybe a benign process.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to EXCEL.EXE creating file streams. The files are in a temporary directory under the user's AppData. One of the files is a .xlsx file, and another is a Zone.Identifier stream. Zone.Identifier is often used by Windows to mark files as coming from the internet, which can trigger security warnings. But creating a Zone.Identifier stream isn't necessarily malicious on its own. However, the fact that Excel is creating these streams might be normal if the user is opening files, but I need to check more.\n\nThen there's an entry where EXCEL.EXE loads coml2.dll from the System32 directory. Loading system DLLs is normal, but sometimes attackers might inject malicious code into legitimate processes. However, coml2.dll is a legitimate system file, so this might not be suspicious unless there's something else.\n\nNext, there are a bunch of File created events from SDXHelper.exe. These files are in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory and seem to be various JavaScript files. The names like \"az-latn-az-ui-strings-json\" look like localization files. However, the repetition of some files (like the bn-in-ui-strings-json file appearing twice) might be a red flag. Also, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I should check if that's a legitimate process. If it's not, that could be a problem. But if it's part of some Office add-in or tool, maybe it's okay.\n\nThe Registry value set events from EXCEL.EXE are numerous. Changing registry values can be a sign of malware trying to modify system settings. However, Excel might legitimately modify the registry for various reasons, like storing user preferences or configuration settings. But without knowing the specific keys being modified, it's hard to tell. However, the high number of registry events might indicate something unusual.\n\nPutting this all together: the presence of SDXHelper.exe creating a lot of files in Office directories could be normal if it's part of a legitimate Office solution. However, the repeated file creation and the lack of obvious malicious indicators (like common malicious DLLs or known bad hashes) might not be enough. The Zone.Identifier stream creation and registry changes are somewhat suspicious but not definitive.\n\nWait, the first event mentions a file named \"1680A406.xlsx\" in the Temp directory. If that's a malicious file, but there's no hash or other indicators here. The SDXHelper.exe files are in the SolutionPackages folder, which is part of Office's setup for add-ins. So maybe this is related to an Office add-in or a language pack. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate an issue, like a loop or an error in the process.\n\nAnother point: the user's name is \"fiddelis\" – maybe a typo? Not sure if that's relevant. The paths are all in the user's AppData, which is typical for user-specific files. The fact that Excel is creating .LNK files in the Recent directory is normal as well, since that's where shortcuts are stored when files are opened.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most suspicious parts are the SDXHelper.exe activities and the numerous registry changes. However, without more context or known bad indicators, it's hard to confirm. The classification might be on the fence. But given that there's no clear malicious activity (like unexpected processes, known malicious files, or network connections), it might be considered not interesting. However, the presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe and the registry events could still be worth investigating further. Maybe the confidence is moderate, around 0.6, but I need to decide if it's enough to classify as \"INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: EXCEL.EXE creating file streams in temporary directories, SDXHelper.exe generating numerous localization-related JS files in Office directories (uncommon behavior), and repeated registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events.\n\nThe first few entries are about EXCEL.EXE setting registry values. That's normal for Excel, maybe updating some settings. But then there are a bunch of entries with SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names like taskpane_e0bdd6190d96fa9514e08006ef2230b9.js. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Office Add-in installer, right? It's responsible for deploying add-ins. So creating these files might be part of installing or updating an add-in. But why are there so many files being created? The paths look like they're part of different language-specific UI strings. Maybe a legitimate add-in is being installed, but the repetition of some files (like the ca-es-valencia ones) might be a red flag. \n\nHowever, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known process. The events are all FileCreated with the rule FileCreate. There's no mention of any malicious activity here. The user might be concerned if these files are part of a malicious add-in, but without more context like unusual network activity, registry changes, or other suspicious processes, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut wait, the first two entries are from EXCEL.EXE modifying the registry. That's normal, but if there were other malicious activities, that could be a sign. However, in this batch, the rest are all from SDXHelper.exe creating files. Since SDXHelper is a legitimate process, and the files are in expected locations for add-ins, maybe this is just a normal installation. \n\nHowever, the presence of multiple file creations with similar names might indicate a large add-in deployment. But without seeing any anomalies in the file content or other processes, it's hard to classify this as malicious. The logs don't show any signs of exploitation or unauthorized access. \n\nSo, considering all this, the batch might not be interesting unless there's more context. The justification would be that the events are related to a legitimate process installing or updating Office add-ins. But I should check if there's any pattern that could be suspicious. The repetition of the same file paths might be a mistake, but maybe it's just multiple files being created. \n\nOverall, since there's no clear malicious activity indicated, the classification is likely NOT INTERESTING.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing file creation by SDXHelper.exe in various paths under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The first thing I notice is that the same file is being created multiple times, like the gl-es-ui-strings-json file appears twice. Also, there are several different files with similar naming patterns, all ending with .js, which are JavaScript files.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, specifically related to solution packages. However, the fact that there are multiple file creations in the OfflineFiles directory might be a red flag. Normally, Office might generate some files during installation or updates, but the repetition here could indicate something unusual. \n\nWait, but looking at the paths, they are all within the Office SolutionPackages folder. That's a standard location for Office add-ins or packages. The filenames seem to be localization files (like gl-es, he-il, etc.), which are language-specific UI strings. That makes sense if the system is being updated or installed with multiple language packs. However, the same file being created multiple times might be redundant. Maybe it's a mistake in logging, or perhaps the process is being used to inject malicious files under the guise of legitimate Office operations.\n\nBut then again, the process name is correct, and the files are in expected directories. However, the sheer number of files created in a short period could be suspicious. If this is part of a normal installation, there might be a larger number of files, but the repetition of the same files might not be normal. Also, the presence of multiple language-specific files might be part of a legitimate setup, but I need to check if that's typical.\n\nAnother angle: the use of SDXHelper.exe. If this process is being used to create files that are not part of a standard Office installation, that could be a sign of something malicious. But without more context, like other processes or network activity, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that all these files are JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory might be part of a legitimate package, but sometimes malware uses similar tactics to hide in plain sight.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because while the process is legitimate, the repetitive creation of multiple files in a directory that's not typically used for frequent file creation could indicate either a benign but unusual activity or a potential malicious attempt.

The files have names like \"ka-ge-ui-strings-json...\" with different language codes. That seems odd because those are typically resource files, but why so many being created in that location? Also, some files are duplicated, like the km-kh-ui-strings-json appearing twice. Maybe that's a normal part of the process, but I'm not sure.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events from EXCEL.EXE. Multiple entries here might indicate some configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. The DNS query from EXCEL.EXE could be normal too, like looking up a domain for updates or something.\n\nWait, the main thing here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. That process name doesn't ring a bell as a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's part of an Office add-in or a third-party tool.
