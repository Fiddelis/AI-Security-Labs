That's a normal Windows utility that displays the current user's identity. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a ProcessAccess event for powershell.exe. Again, PowerShell is a common tool, so this might be normal. But then we see cmd.exe running a command to add a registry entry under HKCU's Run key. The command adds \"estrutura_principal.exe\" to start at login. That's a bit suspicious because modifying the registry to add a startup entry could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThen there's another RegistryEvent where a registry value is set. This aligns with the previous event's action. The combination of modifying the registry through cmd and PowerShell might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. However, without more context, like network activity or other malicious behaviors, it's a bit ambiguous. But the fact that two different processes are involved in modifying the registry and the command line arguments suggest someone is trying to set up a backdoor or persistent access. \n\nI need to check if these events are part of normal user activity. Adding a registry entry could be legitimate, like installing software. But the use of cmd.exe with REG ADD and the specific path might be a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible this is a legitimate action, but the combination of events points towards potential malicious intent. So, classifying this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence makes sense.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creation events combined with registry modification attempts, including adding a startup entry for 'estrutura_principal.exe', suggest potential persistence mechanism attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
