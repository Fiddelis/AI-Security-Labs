So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the tasks. There are several ImageLoad events, which is normal because PowerShell uses .NET assemblies. However, I notice that some of the loaded DLLs are from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's a bit odd because why would PowerShell be loading Defender's DLLs? Maybe it's a red herring, but I should note that.\n\nThen there's a FileDelete event where a temporary script file is deleted. The path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. But the deletion might be part of cleaning up after some activity. Also, there's a FileCreate event for another temporary script. That could be normal, but combined with the deletion, it might indicate some script execution that's trying to hide its tracks.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the ProcessCreate events: \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Wait, \"unidade_auxiliar\" is Portuguese for \"auxiliary unit\" or \"auxiliary drive\". The command is trying to create a PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks like someone is trying to map a network drive, possibly to access files on a remote system. But the typo in the parameter name (\"unidade_auxiliar\" instead of \"unit\") might be a mistake or an attempt to obfuscate the command. That's suspicious because it's not standard PowerShell syntax. The correct parameter is \"-root\" or \"-unit\", but here it's using a different term. That could be a sign of malicious activity, maybe trying to access a remote machine's C$ share, which is a common attack vector.\n\nAlso, multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs are normal, but the combination with the network drive creation and the file operations (create and delete) in temporary directories might indicate that the PowerShell process is being used to execute scripts or access remote resources. The presence of the FileDelete event for a script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_... suggests that a script was executed and then deleted, which is often seen in attacks to avoid leaving evidence.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated loading of the same DLLs, which might be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a sign. However, the key suspicious event here is the ProcessCreate with the non-standard command line trying to create a network drive. That seems like a high-risk activity. Even though some of the other events are normal, the combination of these factors makes me think this is worth investigating further. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75. The justification would be the suspicious command line and the file operations that could indicate script execution and network access attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events include suspicious behavior: (1) Non-standard command line attempting to create a network drive with a Portuguese-labeled parameter ('unidade_auxiliar'), (2) File creation\/deletion of temporary script files, and (3) Loading of Windows Defender DLLs in potentially malicious contexts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event shows a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit suspicious because that directory is typically used for startup scripts, and creating a file there might be part of setting up persistent access.\n\nThen there are several entries with the same command line: using PowerShell to download a script from a GitHub repository named WinPwn. The URL looks legitimate, but the script name and the fact that it's being downloaded and executed via IEX (Invoke-Expression) is a red flag. IEX is commonly used in PowerShell attacks to run malicious scripts from memory, which helps avoid leaving files on disk.\n\nThere are multiple instances of the same command line, which might indicate that the process is being repeated, possibly to ensure the script runs even if interrupted. Also, the presence of \"-noninteractive -consoleoutput\" suggests the script is designed to run without user interaction, which is typical for malware.\n\nAnother part of the logs shows commands to create a new PSDrive mapping a network share (\\\\Target\\\\C$) to a drive letter 'g'. This is often done to access files on a remote system, which could be part of lateral movement in a network attack.\n\nHowever, some entries have \"None\" for process, winlog, or file, which might be due to incomplete logging or maybe the system didn't capture those details. But the repeated PowerShell commands and the creation of the file in the startup directory are strong indicators of malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of downloading and executing a suspicious script, creating a file in a sensitive location, and attempting to map a network drive points towards a potential security threat. The confidence is high because these are common tactics in cyber attacks, even though some logs are missing data. The presence of multiple similar events increases the likelihood that this isn't just a false positive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing a suspicious script (WinPwn.ps1) from a GitHub repository, combined with file creation in a sensitive directory and attempts to map network drives, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
