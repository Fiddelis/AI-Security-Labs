However, the sheer number of files created might be unusual. Alternatively, it could be a benign process. \n\nI need to consider if there's any indication of malicious activity. Since all events are file creations by a legitimate process in a known directory, and there's no mention of other suspicious activities (like network connections, registry changes, etc.), it might be normal. However, the use of hashes in filenames is a bit suspicious. \n\nBut without additional context, like other events or known bad indicators, it's hard to classify this as malicious. The justification would be that the files are created by a legitimate process in a typical location, but the hash-based filenames and repetition might warrant further investigation. However, since the user wants a classification based on the batch, and there's no clear malicious indicator here, it might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. Wait, but maybe the fact that so many files are created by SDXHelper.exe could be abnormal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of a legitimate Office update process. I think the confidence here is low because there's not enough evidence of malicious activity. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.4, as there's no clear malicious behavior detected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which is consistent with normal Office update\/installation processes.

The user provided a bunch of JSON log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look at the commonalities among these events.\n\nAll the entries have the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" and a winlog task of \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory under AppData. The filenames are JavaScript files, some with \"officeaicopilot-strings\" and others with \"word-copilot\". \n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft Office process. I remember that legitimate processes usually have names like \"Microsoft.Office.xxxx\". The fact that these files are being created in the Office directory might be suspicious. Also, the repetition of certain filenames, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min...\" with different hashes, could indicate that these are being generated or copied multiple times, maybe as part of an installation or update. \n\nBut wait, Office 365 does have copilot features, so maybe these are legitimate resources. However, the process name SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring a bell as a known good process. Also, the fact that so many files are being created in a short time might be a sign of something malicious. \n\nHowever, the justification needs to be concise. The key points are the unusual process name and the files being created in a specific Office directory. Since the process isn't standard, and the files are JavaScript which can be used for malicious purposes, this might be interesting. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.7.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some Office add-in or copilot feature, given the \"officeaicopilot-strings\" and \"word-copilot\" in the filenames.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but it's also been used in some malware contexts. However, the key here is the pattern of the file creations. All the files are in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles directory, which is part of Office's solution packages. This might be part of a legitimate update or installation process, especially if the files are related to Office Copilot, which is a real feature.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many files being created? And why are they all JavaScript files? Office typically doesn't need to create so many JS files in that directory. Also, the filenames have unique hashes, which might be part of different versions or updates. However, the repetition of the same filenames (like officeaicopilot-strings.min_cfb234105f99686ff66b5305f2fd2c86.js appearing twice) might indicate something. Maybe it's a normal installation, but the sheer number of files could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the process creating these files is SDXHelper.exe. If this process is part of a legitimate Office installation, then it's okay. But if it's being used by malware to drop files, that's bad. However, without more context, like other events (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or process injections), it's hard to say. The events here are all file creations, which could be part of a legitimate software deployment.\n\nBut the classification needs to be based on the given data. The fact that multiple files are being created in a non-standard way (with hashes in the names) might be indicative of something. However, Office's solution packages do use hashes for versioning. So maybe this is normal. Alternatively, if the files are being created by a process that's not typically associated with that directory, that's a problem.\n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, the pattern could be normal. On the other, the number of files and the specific directory might be unusual. But without more data, I think it's more likely that this is part of a legitimate Office update, especially if the user is running a version that includes Copilot. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious activity in the events provided. However, if the SDXHelper.exe is not a legitimate process, that would change things.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event by the SDXHelper.exe process. The files are all JavaScript files located in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory under OfflineFiles. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in handling solution packages. But why are there so many files being created? Let me check the paths again.\n\nThe files are in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles subdirectory. The filenames have patterns like \"word-copilot.min_...\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\", which look like they might be related to Office Add-ins or copilot features. However, the hash parts of the filenames are different each time, which could be normal if they're different versions or resources. But wait, there are duplicates in the same batch. For example, two entries have the same path for \"word-copilot.min_2964af3c5a68dc6c600202a0762070c3.js\". Maybe that's just a repetition in the log, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, considering the classification. If all these files are part of a legitimate Office update or installation, then they might be normal. However, the fact that multiple files are created in a short period might indicate an attempt to inject malicious code. But the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is trusted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the files are being created as part of a legitimate feature, like downloading resources for an add-in. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and different hashes could be a sign of something unusual. But without more context, like other events (e.g., network connections to suspicious IPs, unusual process behavior), it's hard to say.\n\nThe key here is that the process is legitimate, and the files are in a known directory. However, the sheer number of files being created might be a red flag. But since all events are about file creation by a trusted process, maybe it's just part of normal operations. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. If all these events are part of a normal update, then it's not interesting. But if they are part of an attack, like exfiltrating data or installing malware, then it's interesting. However, the logs don't show any other suspicious activities. The only thing is the high volume of file creations, which might be normal during an update.\n\nSo, the justification would be that the events are related to legitimate Office operations, but the high number of files might warrant further investigation. However, since the process is trusted and the files are in expected locations, it's more likely not interesting. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the confidence is around 0.5. But I need to check if there's any known malicious activity related to SDXHelper.exe creating such files. If not, then it's probably not interesting. However, the presence of multiple files with different hashes might be a sign of something. But without more data, it's hard to say. I think the safest classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the process is legitimate and the files are in the expected directory, even though the number is high.
