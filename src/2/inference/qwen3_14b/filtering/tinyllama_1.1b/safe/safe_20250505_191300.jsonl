All the entries are related to Discord.exe, which is a legitimate application. The events include network connections, process accesses, DNS queries, and image loads. Most of these are normal activities for a running application. However, I notice that there are multiple \"File creation time changed\" events pointing to temporary files in the Discord directory. While temporary files are common, changing their creation times might be unusual. Also, there's an entry where the process is null and the task is \"None,\" which could be an anomaly. But considering that Discord is a known application and the majority of events are typical for its operation, it's likely that these are just normal operations. The presence of some temporary file modifications might not be malicious on their own. I don't see any clear signs of compromise or suspicious activity here. So, I would classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are related to legitimate Discord.exe operations (networking, process access, image loading).

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's normal. The file path seems legitimate, and it's a .yml.new file, which might be part of configuration setup.\n\nNext, Discord.exe has a ProcessAccess event. Process access can be normal, but sometimes it's used in attacks. However, the third event is about Discord changing the creation time of a file in its AppData directory. Changing file timestamps isn't common for regular apps. That might be a red flag.\n\nWait, but why would Discord change the file's creation time? Maybe it's just a normal operation, but the combination of ProcessAccess and FileCreateTime changes might indicate something. The first event is normal, but the other two involve Discord doing things that aren't typical. However, without more context, like other suspicious activities or errors, it's hard to say. The confidence here is medium. Maybe the user is just using Discord normally, but the events are a bit unusual. I'll lean towards \"Interesting\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Discord.exe exhibits unusual behavior with 'ProcessAccess' and 'FileCreateTime' modifications in AppData, while winlogbeat.exe's file creation appears legitimate.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's MpCmdRun.exe loading images, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .lock file. That might be temporary, but not necessarily bad. \n\nThen Discord.exe shows up multiple times with network connections and pipe creations. The PipeEvent tasks are common for inter-process communication, but if there are a lot of them, maybe that's a red flag. Also, Discord.exe has ProcessAccess events, which could be normal, but maybe not. \n\nWait, looking further down, there's reg.exe being used to add an entry to the Run key in the registry. The command line shows adding a registry entry that starts Discord.exe via Update.exe. That seems a bit odd. Why would someone add a registry entry for Discord to run at startup? Maybe it's legitimate if the user wants Discord to start automatically, but if this is unexpected, it could be malicious. \n\nAlso, the same reg.exe is querying the Run key, which might be part of checking if the entry already exists. But combining that with the addition of the entry could indicate an attempt to persist the application, which is a common tactic in malware. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there are other suspicious activities. The other processes like OneDriveLauncher.exe and SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and combase.dll seem normal. Those are standard system files. \n\nBut the repeated network connections from Discord.exe might be normal if the user is using Discord actively. However, if there's no user activity and the connections are frequent, that's suspicious. But the logs don't mention user activity, so it's unclear. \n\nAnother point is the presence of multiple PipeEvent tasks for Discord.exe. If an application is creating many pipes, it might be trying to communicate with other processes or even exfiltrate data. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe key suspicious part here is the registry modification. Adding a Run key entry could be part of persistence mechanisms. If this is done without user consent, it's malicious. But if the user has legitimately set up Discord to start on boot, it's benign. \n\nHowever, since the logs don't provide user context, the registry change alone is a potential indicator of compromise. Combined with the multiple network connections and pipe events, it's worth investigating further. \n\nSo, the classification is likely \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the registry modification and the multiple network activities that could indicate persistence or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple network connections from Discord.exe combined with registry modification attempts (reg.exe adding a Run key entry) suggest potential persistence mechanisms or unauthorized access attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because taskhostw is a legitimate Windows process, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. No red flags here.\n\nThen there's Discord.exe with several events. The first few entries show ProcessAccess and NetworkConnect. Discord is a common application, so normal network activity might be expected. However, looking at the frequency, there are multiple NetworkConnect events for Discord.exe. Let me count them. There's one from the first entry, then several more. Wait, there are like 15 entries of NetworkConnect for Discord.exe. That's a lot. Even though Discord does connect to the internet, having so many connections in a short time might be unusual. But maybe it's just a busy application. However, I should check if there are any other suspicious activities.\n\nAnother event is smartscreen.exe loading urlmon.dll. SmartScreen is part of Windows Defender, and urlmon.dll is a standard DLL for Internet Explorer. That seems okay too.\n\nThen there's an entry with process null and task \"None\". That might be a log error or a placeholder, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking again at the Discord events. The high number of NetworkConnect and ProcessAccess events could indicate something. If Discord is accessing its own process multiple times, maybe it's injecting code or doing something unusual. But ProcessAccess can be normal for an application to access its own processes. However, the sheer volume might be a sign. Also, are there any other processes involved? The other processes are taskhostw, smartscreen, and svchost, which are all legitimate.\n\nWait, svchost.exe has a RegistryEvent where a registry value is set. That's normal for svchost, which hosts various system services. No obvious issues there.\n\nSo the main concern is the Discord.exe events. But is this normal behavior? Discord does connect to its servers, but 15 network connections might be excessive. However, without more context, like the destination IPs or if there are failed connections, it's hard to say. Also, the ProcessAccess events might be part of normal operations. However, the high frequency could indicate a potential issue, like a botnet or data exfiltration. But since the user hasn't provided more details, I need to rely on the given data.\n\nConsidering that there's no mention of any malicious files, unexpected processes, or unusual registry changes beyond normal operations, maybe this isn't a clear case. The presence of multiple network connections from Discord could be benign. However, the classification is about whether it's interesting for investigation. Even if it's not definitively malicious, the high number of events might warrant further look into. But I need to balance that with the lack of clear indicators. The confidence level should be moderate. So, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence of around 0.6, justified by the high frequency of network connections from Discord.exe which could indicate unusual activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Discord.exe instances show repeated NetworkConnect events (15+ entries), which may indicate unusual network behavior. While Discord is legitimate, such high-frequency connections could suggest potential data exfiltration or C2 activity. Other events (e.g., taskhostw.exe, smartscreen.exe) involve standard system processes and no clear malicious indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
