That's a legitimate system file, so maybe normal. Then there's rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll. Wait, the command line has a GUID and -Embedding. That might be a red flag because sometimes malicious code uses rundll32 with unusual parameters. \n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe again loads urlmon.dll, which is also a legitimate file. Then EXCEL.EXE is started with a CSV file. That seems normal, but then there's an image load of mscoree.dll, which is part of the .NET framework. Not suspicious. WmiPrvSE.exe loading wmiutils.dll is okay too.\n\nLooking at the other entries, there's a file created in the Recent folder: real_values.csv.LNK. That's a shortcut, but creating a shortcut might not be malicious. However, the user is running Excel and accessing a CSV file. Wait, but why is there a shortcut created? Maybe it's part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers create shortcuts to hide malicious files. \n\nAlso, there are multiple User Account Management events, but they don't have process names. Not sure if that's relevant. The DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE could be normal if it's accessing external resources. \n\nBut the main thing is the rundll32.exe command with that GUID. That seems suspicious. GUIDs in commands are often used in malicious activities. Also, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading multiple DLLs. Wait, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a third-party app, but if it's loading system DLLs, that might be okay. However, combined with the rundll32 command, it could indicate something. \n\nBut I need to check if there's a pattern. The user is running Excel, which is normal. The creation of the .LNK file might be part of Excel's normal behavior when opening files. However, the rundll32 command with the GUID is more concerning. Maybe it's a false positive, but the combination of that command and the other events might be worth looking into. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the rundll32 command with the unusual parameters is a potential indicator of malicious activity. Even though other events are normal, that one command stands out. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's some suspicious activity but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious use of rundll32.exe with a non-standard command line containing a GUID and '-Embedding' flag, which is often associated with malicious activity. Combined with multiple image loads from legitimate system DLLs by SDXHelper.exe, which may indicate process injection or DLL hijacking techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
