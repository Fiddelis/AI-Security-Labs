The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where powershell.exe is executing commands. The command lines are similar, each time creating a scheduled task with New-ScheduledTaskAction, triggering at logon, and setting the principal to Administrators with high run level. The executed command is calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows application, but the way it's being scheduled here might be suspicious.\n\nWait, but why would someone create a scheduled task to run calc.exe? That's a bit odd because calc.exe is just the calculator. Maybe this is a red herring, or perhaps a test. However, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with the same structure could indicate an attempt to persist access. The tasks are registered under different names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The fact that these tasks are being created multiple times might be an attempt to evade detection by changing the task names each time.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with different winlog tasks, like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Image loaded. The Image loaded events point to mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. That's normal for PowerShell if it's using .NET, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it might be part of a larger activity.\n\nBut the main concern here is the creation of scheduled tasks with administrative privileges. Even though calc.exe is a benign process, the method of creating these tasks with high-level permissions could be a sign of privilege escalation or an attempt to maintain persistence. The repetition of such events in the logs might indicate that the attacker is trying to establish multiple entry points or is testing the system's defenses.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or network activity here. The tasks are set to run calc.exe, which isn't inherently malicious. But in the context of multiple task creations and PowerShell usage, it could be part of a more complex attack. The classification here is tricky. On one hand, it's suspicious behavior; on the other, the actual payload is benign. But the pattern and repetition might still warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with administrative rights using PowerShell is a potential indicator of malicious activity, even if the immediate action is harmless. The confidence is around 0.75 because while the direct action isn't malicious, the pattern is suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges to execute calc.exe, which may indicate an attempt to establish persistence or escalate privileges. The repetitive pattern across different task names suggests potential malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze the batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first few entries mention 'Image loaded' for files in the Windows assembly and Windows Defender directories. Those might be normal system processes, but I should note them. Then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory, which could be benign, like a temporary script. But the next event is a pipe created, which might be part of normal operations or could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell command line that stands out. It shows the creation of a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' as the action, set to trigger at logon, and configured to run as Administrators with high privileges. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism. The command line is a clear indicator of someone trying to set up a backdoor or maintain access.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with registry value sets. That's a lot of registry changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. However, the number of events might be significant. But the main red flag here is the PowerShell scheduled task. The other entries might be noise, but the scheduled task creation is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are several entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' under 'None' process. That's a bit concerning, but if the process is not specified, it might be a detection rule that's not properly linked to a process. However, the PowerShell events are more concrete.\n\nPutting it all together, the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges is a strong sign of something malicious. Even if other events are normal, the presence of that specific PowerShell command line warrants further investigation. The confidence here would be high because creating a scheduled task with such parameters is a common tactic in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious scheduled task creation with 'calc.exe' set to execute at logon with Administrator privileges, indicating potential privilege escalation or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there's an entry about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes malware uses WmiPrvSE for persistence. However, the file path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll, which is a standard system file. So maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there are several entries with svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and setting registry values isn't necessarily bad. But if it's happening multiple times, maybe something's going on. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for legitimate scripts, but could also be used by malware. However, the filename is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, which sounds like a normal PowerShell profile file. Maybe that's just a user's own script.\n\nThen there's an entry with a process named None executing a remote command. That's suspicious because if the process field is None, it might mean the event didn't capture the process name, which could be a sign of something trying to hide. But I need to check if that's a valid scenario or a log error.\n\nLooking at the other entries, there are multiple Chrome processes making registry changes and DNS queries. Chrome often has a lot of activity, but repeated registry changes might not be normal. However, the DNS query is just a normal part of browsing unless it's going to a suspicious domain, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. The files mentioned are .yml.new, which might be temporary files during configuration setup. That seems legitimate.\n\nThe user mentioned that the process in one event is None. That's a red flag because typically, every event should have a process associated. If the process is missing, it could indicate that the event is being generated by a source that doesn't track processes properly, or it's a sign of evasion. However, without knowing the exact context of the log source, it's a bit hard to say. But in most cases, that's a suspicious point.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of the events seem to be normal system and user activities. However, the presence of the event with the process as None might be an anomaly. Also, the multiple registry changes by svchost and Chrome might be worth looking into. But unless there's a pattern or a known malicious activity, it's not conclusive. The confidence here is a bit low because the interesting points are not strong enough on their own. However, the presence of the \"None\" process is a minor flag, but maybe not enough to classify as interesting. I think the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious activity, just some normal logs with a minor anomaly that might not be significant.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events involve legitimate system processes (e.g., svchost.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe) and common activities (registry changes, file creation). No clear malicious indicators like unexpected binaries, suspicious network activity, or anomalous process behavior are present. The 'None' process entry may indicate incomplete logging but lacks context for alarm.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
