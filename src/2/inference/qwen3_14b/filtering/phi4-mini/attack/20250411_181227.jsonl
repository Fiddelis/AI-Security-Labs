{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event stands out because it's a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task. The command line shows they're using New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, which is a common trick for malicious actors to execute arbitrary code. The trigger is set to run at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with high privileges. That's a red flag because normally, you wouldn't want a task that runs as admin on logon unless it's a legitimate system task.\n\nThen there's an entry about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's part of the Windows Task Scheduler, so maybe that's normal, but combined with the first event, it might indicate that the scheduled task is being manipulated. The other events mostly involve svchost.exe and chrome.exe making registry changes and file creations. However, the repeated registry events and file creations might be part of normal operations, but when combined with the initial suspicious PowerShell command, it could indicate an attempt to establish persistence.\n\nThe other PowerShell events creating files in the user's Downloads directory might be part of data exfiltration or setting up additional malicious files. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files could be related to logging, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, there's not enough evidence here to confirm a breach definitively. The key point is the first event with the scheduled task. Since that's a high-privilege task being created with a command to run calc.exe (which is often used in PoC attacks), this is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the combination of creating a scheduled task with admin rights and the use of PowerShell for that is a common attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows PowerShell creating a scheduled task with high privileges (Administrators group) that executes calc.exe at logon, which is suspicious. This could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. Additional events include file creations and registry modifications that may support malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe has a file loaded, specifically MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe just normal operation. But then there's a File created event for a temporary script file, and then immediately a File Delete event for the same file. That could be part of a script execution that's cleaning up, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but not always malicious. Then the command_line shows a PowerShell script that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group and highest privileges. That's suspicious because calc.exe is a benign app, but using it in a scheduled task with elevated permissions might be a red flag. It could be a test or a real attack.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but the repetition might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The rest of the events are \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process specified. That's concerning because it could indicate command and control activity, but the lack of process info might mean the logs are incomplete or the events are from a source that doesn't track processes well.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation, are suspicious. The temporary file creation and deletion might be part of an attack. The remote command executions are also worrying. However, some events could be normal, like the Defender DLL and Chrome's registry changes. But the combination of PowerShell's suspicious activity and the remote commands raises the confidence level. I'd say this is interesting, but the confidence isn't 100% because some events might be benign. Maybe around 0.75 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious PowerShell activity detected, including creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges and deletion of temporary script files. Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events without associated processes also raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the process \"powershell.exe\" and command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar, using PowerShell to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe. The triggers are set to \"AtLogon,\" which means the task runs when a user logs in. The principal is set to \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running tasks with admin rights can be a sign of privilege escalation or malicious activity.\n\nNow, looking at the task names: \"registro_geral\", \"unidade_ativo\", \"entrada_ativo\", \"tarefa_base\", \"pacote_logico\", \"entrada_temporario\", \"tarefa_geral\". These names are in Portuguese, which might be a language used by the attacker, but not necessarily malicious. However, the repetition of creating similar tasks with different names might indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n\nOther events include \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" tasks, which are common in normal operations but could be part of a larger attack. However, the key here is the scheduled task creation. Using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks that run with high privileges is a classic technique used by malware to maintain access. The fact that multiple such tasks are created in quick succession (assuming these logs are from a short time frame) suggests automated or scripted behavior, which is suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries about image loading, like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll. These are .NET framework components, so their presence might be normal, but if they're loaded in an unusual context, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, the main concern here is the scheduled tasks.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin rights using PowerShell points to potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like registry changes), the combination with the scheduled task creation makes this batch interesting. The confidence is high because the pattern is consistent with known attack techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges to execute calc.exe at user logon. This pattern is commonly associated with privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms in malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
