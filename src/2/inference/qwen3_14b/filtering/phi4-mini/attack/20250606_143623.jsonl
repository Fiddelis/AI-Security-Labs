Files like msedge_proxy.exe, msedge_pwa_launcher.exe, notification_helper.exe, and others. That seems a bit unusual because setup.exe is typically part of an installer, but creating these specific files in the EdgeCore folder might be part of a legitimate installation. However, the fact that there are so many files being created here could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's an entry where setup.exe is creating another setup.exe in the Installer subdirectory. That's a bit suspicious because it's a common tactic for malware to drop a copy of itself in different locations to persist or evade detection. \n\nLooking at the other processes, there's a lot of activity from svchost.exe and services.exe related to registry changes. While svchost.exe is a normal system process, excessive registry modifications could indicate something malicious, especially if combined with other suspicious activities. However, some of these might be part of normal system operations, so I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe changing a registry value is also something to note. RuntimeBroker is usually associated with UAC prompts, so if it's modifying registry keys, that might not be normal. But again, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the multiple file creations by setup.exe in a specific directory, the self-replicating setup.exe in the Installer folder, and the numerous registry changes by system processes.

So, the majority of the events are about the Registry value being set by processes like services.exe, svchost.exe, and MsMpEng.exe. Those are all legitimate system processes, right? Services.exe is part of the Windows service control manager, svchost.exe hosts various system services, and MsMpEng.exe is related to Windows Defender. So, their interaction with the registry might be normal, especially if they're updating settings or configurations.\n\nBut then there are two file creation events. The setup.exe process is creating msedge.exe and msedgewebview2.exe in the Program Files directory. Now, setup.exe is typically a legitimate installer, but the paths here are under Microsoft EdgeCore. Wait, Microsoft Edge does have some components in that directory, but the filenames might be part of a legitimate installation. However, the presence of these files being created by setup.exe could be part of a normal software install. However, if this is unexpected, like if the user didn't initiate an Edge update or installation, that could be suspicious.\n\nBut the problem is, the logs don't provide context about whether this installation was authorized. The classification here depends on whether these events are out of the ordinary. Since the majority of the logs are normal system processes, but the file creations might be part of a legitimate update. However, if there's no other context, maybe it's not enough to flag as interesting. But the fact that setup.exe is creating executable files in Program Files might be something to check. However, without more info, like if there's a lack of user interaction or if other malicious activities are present, it's hard to say. The confidence here might be moderate. But since the user is asking to determine if the batch is interesting, and the file creation is part of a normal install, maybe it's not interesting. But maybe the repeated registry changes could be a sign. Wait, but registry changes by those processes are normal. So, perhaps the answer is NOT INTERESTING, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, if the setup.exe is part of a legitimate installer, then it's normal. But if the setup.exe is not expected, maybe it's a red flag.

That's common, but when combined with certain events, it can be suspicious. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing processes, loading images, and creating\/deleting files. For example, there's a file created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That could be a sign of temporary malicious activity, like downloading a script and then cleaning up.\n\nThen, there's the 'tarefa_logico.exe' process. The name doesn't ring a bell; it might be a typo or a made-up name. The fact that it's loading several .NET-related DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll is interesting. Those are legitimate files, but if they're being loaded by an unknown process, that could indicate something's wrong. Also, the process is loading multiple DLLs from the .NET Framework, which might be part of a legitimate application, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it raises a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the registry events. There are several 'Registry value set' events from both powershell.exe and services.exe. While services.exe modifying the registry isn't unusual, if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, it could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nThe combination of PowerShell executing commands (like whoami.exe), creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, and loading various DLLs might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or payloads. The presence of 'tarefa_logico.exe' which is not a standard Windows process and is loading multiple .NET components could be a sign of a malicious payload or a dropper.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks. But when combined with the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the loading of multiple DLLs by an unknown process, it's more likely to be malicious.\n\nThe confidence here is medium to high. The presence of multiple suspicious activities, especially the combination of PowerShell with the unknown executable and the .NET DLLs, suggests that further investigation is needed.

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them involve 'setup.exe' performing various actions. There are multiple entries where 'setup.exe' is setting registry values and creating files. Some of the files created are in typical locations like Program Files and Windows System32, but others are in temporary directories. For example, there's a file created at 'C:\\Windows\\Temp\\APPX.y47c9yblr3f319uuor69grpkb.tmp' by 'svchost.exe'. That might be normal, as svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but creating multiple temporary files could be suspicious if they're part of an installation or update. However, the presence of 'setup.exe' doing a lot of registry modifications and file creations might be a red flag.\n\nWait, 'setup.exe' is often associated with installation processes, so maybe this is a legitimate software installation. But then again, malware can also use setup.exe to disguise its activities. The fact that there are multiple registry value sets and file creations could indicate that something is trying to modify the system's configuration. Also, the creation of shortcut files like 'Microsoft Edge.lnk' in user directories might be part of a legitimate installation, but if done without user consent, it could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the 'Pipe Created' events. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if there are multiple pipes created by 'setup.exe', that might be part of a larger attack, such as establishing a backdoor or communication channel. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious or just part of a normal process.\n\nThe presence of 'svchost.exe' creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory is common during installations or updates, but the number of such files might be high here. However, the main concern is the 'setup.exe' activity. If this is part of a legitimate installer, then it's not a problem, but if it's a malicious payload, then it's a problem.\n\nBut the logs don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unexpected processes, network connections, or unusual command-line arguments. The events are all related to registry and file modifications, which are normal during installation. However, the frequency of the events and the number of registry changes might be excessive for a regular setup. Also, the fact that 'setup.exe' is involved in both registry modifications and file creation could be a sign of a more complex activity.\n\nConsidering all that, the classification might be 'INTERESTING' because there's a high volume of registry and file changes by 'setup.exe', which could indicate either a legitimate installation or a potential malicious activity.

So the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here are about file creations and registry changes by svchost.exe. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also a common vector for malware because it's often used by attackers to hide malicious activities. \n\nLooking at the file paths, there are several files created in the Windows Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files. But some of the files are in the AppReadiness folder, which is part of the Windows Setup and Recovery system. The filenames like \"APPX.57wps2mdsltrrqg3yqmqq1r7d.tmp\" look like they could be related to Windows Update or AppX package installations, which are legitimate. However, the repetition of certain files, like the S-1-5-18 and S-1-5-21... files, might be suspicious. These look like security identifiers (SIDs), and creating files with such names in AppReadiness might not be normal.\n\nThen there are the registry value set events by svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's modifying keys related to security or system settings. The fact that there are multiple registry events here could indicate an attempt to alter system behavior.\n\nAnother point is the PowerShell activity. There's a PowerShell process that ran a command to write a host message, which seems benign. However, there are also image load events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. While loading these DLLs isn't inherently bad, if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it could be a red flag. The creation of a file in the Temp directory named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1\" might be related to script execution, which could be part of a larger attack if not properly authorized.\n\nNow, considering all these points: multiple file creations in sensitive directories, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and PowerShell activities. While some of these events could be legitimate (like Windows updates or normal system operations), the combination of these events, especially the repeated file creations in AppReadiness and the registry changes, might indicate something more malicious. However, I need to be cautious because some of these could be part of normal system processes. The confidence here isn't 100% because without more context, like the exact registry keys changed or the nature of the PowerShell scripts, it's hard to be certain.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loading clrjit.dll from the .NET Framework directory. That seems normal because clrjit.dll is part of the .NET runtime. But then there's another event where powershell.exe accesses a process, and another where it loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit more suspicious because MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, and having PowerShell access it might be normal, but maybe not if it's being used in an unusual way.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is typically used to get user information. Not too suspicious on its own. But looking further, there's a PowerShell command that's running with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted. Wait, Restricted is the default policy, so that might be normal. But the command is checking INF files for specific patterns. Maybe looking for defaultinstall sections? That could be part of a script that's trying to find installation configurations, which might be benign, but could also be part of a larger malicious activity if it's extracting information for exploitation.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell creating a file in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts. But the filename is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be related to testing execution policies. Also, there's a Pipe Created event, which could be normal communication between processes, but sometimes used in attacks.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command using Dism to disable Windows Defender. That's a red flag. Disabling security features like Defender is a common tactic in malware to prevent detection. The Dism command is being run with \/Disable-Feature and \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender. That's definitely suspicious because it's modifying the system's security features. Also, the Dism process is detecting executable files in the Temp directory, which could be part of a payload being executed.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell activities, accessing system files, attempting to disable Windows Defender, and creating temporary files. The combination of these events suggests that someone is trying to disable security software and possibly execute malicious code. Even though some individual events are normal, the overall pattern is concerning. The confidence here would be high because disabling Defender is a clear indicator of malicious intent.

They have names like GenericProvider.dll.mui, IBSProvider.dll.mui, etc. These seem to be part of various providers related to DISM, such as ImagingProvider, IntlProvider, SetupPlatformProvider, etc. \n\nThe key point here is that DISM is known to use these provider DLLs during image deployment.

Maybe it's part of a normal cleanup. However, if this is happening in a non-deployment context, it might be suspicious. The user's name is fiddelis, which might be a placeholder or a real user. The GUID in the path is typical for temporary directories, so that's normal.\n\nHmm, but the confidence here is tricky. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, and the deletions are in the Temp folder, it's possible that this is a normal activity. However, the large number of deletions could be indicative of something else. But without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the key here is that all the events are related to Dism.exe, which is a trusted process, and the files are in the Temp directory. While the number of deletions is high, it's not necessarily malicious. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's likely a legitimate operation by Dism.exe. But I should check if there's any pattern that's unusual. The fact that all the files are .dll.mui and from various providers might be part of a standard deployment process. So, the confidence is around 0.4, as there's not enough evidence to confirm it's malicious, but it's not completely benign either.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Dism.exe process deleting temporary files in the expected Temp directory during Windows image deployment operations. The files are standard language resource files (dll.mui) associated with deployment providers, and the pattern aligns with normal system behavior during sysprep or imaging tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. There are multiple entries with the same PowerShell command line. The command is checking INF files in the Windows directory for specific sections related to different architectures (amd64, arm, etc.). The purpose seems to be scanning for default installation sections in INF files. \n\nNow, why would someone do that? Maybe they're looking for signs of malicious software that uses INF files for installation. INF files are used in Windows setup, so checking them could be part of a malware detection process. However, the same command being repeated multiple times might indicate a script that's scanning for something specific.\n\nThe winlog tasks are 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might relate to system events during boot or service startup. The other events are about 'services.exe' and 'Special Logon', which are normal system processes. \n\nBut the key point here is the repeated PowerShell command. If this is part of a legitimate tool, it's not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that it's checking INF files for specific patterns could be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses INF files to install drivers or modify system settings. The repetition of the same command in multiple logs might suggest that the system is being scanned repeatedly, which could be part of a security tool or potentially malicious activity.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to tell. The command itself isn't obviously malicious, but the frequency and the specific checks might warrant further investigation. The classification here should be 'INTERESTING' because the repeated scanning of INF files for architecture-specific sections could be indicative of either a security check or a potential exploit. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's not enough data to confirm malicious intent, but the pattern is suspicious enough to merit attention.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical PowerShell commands scanning Windows INF files for architecture-specific sections (ntamd64, etc.) were detected. This pattern may indicate an attempt to identify or exploit system installation configurations, which could be part of malicious activity or a security assessment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here. The first thing I notice is that there are several instances of PowerShell commands being executed. Specifically, the command line shows the creation of a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Then, they start that service. That seems suspicious because creating a new service and starting it via PowerShell could be part of an attack, like installing malware.\n\nBut wait, there are also other PowerShell commands that are less suspicious. For example, some are just writing \"Final result: 1\" to the host, and another one is checking INF files for certain patterns. Those might be part of legitimate scripts or testing. However, the repetition of the service creation and start command multiple times might indicate an attempt to persist or execute something malicious.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that the same command is repeated several times. That could be a sign of an automated process or a script that's being run multiple times, which might not be normal. Also, the fact that the service is being created with a custom executable in a non-standard directory (like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...\") raises a red flag. Legitimate services are usually in more standard locations.\n\nBut then again, maybe the user is just testing or doing some system administration tasks. However, the combination of creating a service and starting it immediately, especially with a custom executable, is a common tactic in malware. The repeated entries might indicate that the process is being logged multiple times, perhaps due to the service starting and stopping, or the command being run multiple times.\n\nAlso, the presence of both \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the winlog might be normal, but the consistency of the PowerShell commands across multiple logs suggests a pattern. The confidence here is a bit tricky. The fact that there are multiple entries of the same suspicious command increases the likelihood that this is a legitimate attack, but without more context, like file hashes or network activity, it's hard to be 100% sure. However, the repeated creation of a service with a non-standard executable path is enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell commands creating and starting a service named 'objeto_ativo' with a non-standard executable path ('tarefa_logico.exe') in a suspicious directory structure.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and they probably want to know if there's any malicious activity or something suspicious. Let me go through each entry one by one.\n\nFirst, the first line is just a system message about the user starting a conversation. Then there's a long string of logs. Let me look at the first actual log entry. It starts with \"You are a helpful assistant...\" and then there's a lot of technical data. The user probably wants help analyzing these logs.\n\nLooking at the log entries, there are several entries with \"winlog\" and \"process\" information. The first one has a process name \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" with a command line that includes \"http:\/\/msedge.b.tlu.dl.deliverystore.com\/...\". That URL looks suspicious. Deliverystore.com isn't a known legitimate domain; it might be a phishing site or part of a malicious network. The command line also has parameters like \"1=174975933&amap;2=404&amap;3=2&amap;4=V...\" which could be trying to download something or execute a payload.\n\nAnother entry is about \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" again, but this time the command line is \"http:\/\/msedge.b.tlu.dl.deliverystore.com\/...\". Wait, that's the same as before. Maybe that's a repeated attempt. Then there's a process called \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" with a long command line that includes a URL with \"deliverystore.com\" again. The URL has parameters that might be trying to download an executable or some payload. The presence of \"1=174975933\" and other numbers might be part of a tracking or unique identifier for the download.\n\nThen there's a log entry with \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" and a command line that starts with \"http:\/\/msedge.b.tlu.dl.deliverystore.com\/...\". The URL is similar to the previous ones, and the parameters are the same. This seems like a repeated attempt by the update process to connect to a suspicious domain. Deliverystore.com is not a known Microsoft domain; Microsoft's update servers are typically in the msedge.net or microsoft.com domains. This could indicate a malicious update or a man-in-the-middle attack where the update is being redirected to a fake server.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry with a process named \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" and a command line that includes \"http:\/\/msedge.b.tlu.dl.deliverystore.com\/...\". The URL is the same again, which reinforces the suspicion. The parameters are the same as before, which might be part of a specific exploit or data collection.\n\nAnother entry mentions \"Windows Update Agent\" but doesn't have a command line. That might be a normal system process, but combined with the other suspicious entries, it's concerning.\n\nThe other log entries have \"Process Create\" events with the same suspicious domain. The command lines are similar, suggesting that multiple processes are trying to connect to deliverystore.com, which is not a legitimate domain. This could be part of a malware distribution campaign where the update process is being hijacked to download malicious software.\n\nAlso, the presence of \"amap\" in the command line parameters might be a red flag. \"Amap\" is sometimes used in network scanning tools, but in this context, it's part of the URL parameters, which is unusual. It might be a way to obfuscate the actual command or part of a query string that's being used to fetch data from the server.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the process \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" is typically associated with Microsoft Edge updates. If this process is connecting to a non-Microsoft domain, that's a strong indicator of a potential compromise. The user should check if their system has been infected with malware that's repurposing the update process for malicious activities.\n\nThe logs also include a \"Windows Update Agent\" entry, which might be a normal process, but combined with the suspicious activities from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, it could indicate that the system is being targeted. The user should investigate these connections further, maybe by checking the network traffic, looking at the domain's reputation, and ensuring that their antivirus and firewall are up to date.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the repeated connections to deliverystore.com by the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process, the suspicious command line parameters, and the non-legitimacy of the domain involved. These are strong indicators of a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries you've provided indicate **potentially malicious activity** related to **Microsoft Edge updates**, with connections to a suspicious domain (`deliverystore.com`).
