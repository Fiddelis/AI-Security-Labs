There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is common but can be a red flag if there's suspicious behavior. One of the entries has a command line that downloads a script from a GitHub URL.

The pipe created event and registry changes add to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, there are also benign processes like whoami.exe and sppsvc.exe. The presence of legitimate system processes doesn't necessarily mean it's a false positive.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a batch of JSONL events. Each line is a JSON object. Let me look at them.\n\nAll the entries have \"process\" as \"None\", \"winlog\" with task 'Execute a Remote Command', and \"file\" as \"None\". So, every single event is the same. Now, the task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"Execute a Remote Command\" typically means. In Windows logs, that's often part of legitimate administrative tasks, like remote management. But if it's happening repeatedly, maybe there's something off. However, all the events are identical. No variation in the process or file details. That could be a sign of a log being filled with the same event, which might be a false positive or a misconfigured system. Alternatively, maybe the logs are being generated by a script or a tool that's repeatedly executing remote commands. But since there's no other information like user details, command specifics, or different sources, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut the key here is that all events are the same. If this is a real attack, you'd expect some variation in the commands or different processes involved. However, the lack of process and file information might be a red flag. Maybe the logs are incomplete, or the system isn't logging properly. But the classification isn't about individual events; it's about the batch as a whole. \n\nSince all events are identical and there's no additional context, it's possible that this is a normal activity logged multiple times. However, the repetition might be unusual. But without more data, it's hard to be certain. The confidence here would be moderate. The justification would be that multiple identical events with the same task might indicate a potential issue, but without more details, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events with 'Execute a Remote Command' task but no process or file context, suggesting potential log incompleteness or suspicious repeated activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event shows the creation of a new PSDrive, which might be normal, but then there are multiple image loads of .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's common for PowerShell when running scripts, but maybe not always a red flag.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script. The next event deletes that same file, which might be part of a cleanup. But then there's a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication. However, the more concerning part is the command line in some of the events. They have a URL pointing to a GitHub raw file downloading a script named WinPwn.ps1. The domain in the URL is \"raw.githubusercontent.com\", which is legitimate, but the script name \"WinPwn.ps1\" sounds suspicious. \n\nLooking at the command line, it uses \"iex\" (Invoke-Expression) with a WebClient download. That's a common method for executing remote scripts, which can be a sign of malicious activity. Even though the URL is from a known site, the script's name and the fact that it's being downloaded and executed via PowerShell could indicate a security risk. \n\nAlso, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might be related to the script execution. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components could be part of the script's operation. The fact that the script is being downloaded from a public repo might be part of a known attack vector, like using GitHub for hosting malicious scripts. \n\nHowever, since the URL is from a legitimate site, it's possible that this is a false positive or a benign script. But the combination of downloading a script named \"WinPwn.ps1\" and executing it with PowerShell is concerning. The presence of multiple events related to file creation, deletion, and image loading, along with the remote execution, suggests potential malicious behavior. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the classification is likely \"INTERESTING\" because the events indicate a PowerShell script being downloaded and executed from a remote source, which is a common indicator of compromise. The confidence is around 0.85 because while the source is legitimate, the script's name and execution method are suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate remote script execution via 'iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring' from a GitHub URL, followed by file creation\/deletion and .NET assembly loading, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the same command_line in the process field. The command_line is using PowerShell to download a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is from the S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn repository, which I think is a known malicious repository. The command uses iex (Invoke-Expression) with a WebClient to download and execute a PowerShell script. That's a common technique used in PowerShell-based attacks, so that's a red flag.\n\nThen, there are several entries where the command_line is about creating a new PSDrive, mapping a network share (\\\\Target\\C$) to a drive letter (g). This could be part of accessing remote systems or exfiltrating data. The repetition of these commands across multiple log entries suggests that this might be part of a larger attack or a script that's being run multiple times.\n\nAlso, there are entries where the process is None, but the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". Having multiple entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" might indicate that there's remote access happening, which is another suspicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell commands downloading and executing a script from a known malicious source, creating network drive mappings, and multiple remote command executions. These are all indicators of potential malicious activity. The repetition of the same commands in multiple logs suggests that this isn't just a one-off event but part of a larger, ongoing process.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign explanation. Maybe these are part of legitimate scripts or testing? But the GitHub URL is from a repo that's known for malicious purposes. Also, creating a PSDrive to a remote machine's C$ share is typically a sign of lateral movement in a network, which is a common step in attacks.\n\nThe confidence level: since there are multiple instances of these commands, and the combination of downloading a script from a known bad source and mapping network drives, I'd say this is highly suspicious. But I'm not 100% certain without more context, like the source of the logs or other indicators. However, based on the given data, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands downloading and executing a script from a known malicious GitHub repository (S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn), combined with repeated attempts to map remote network drives (\\\\Target\\\\C$), indicate potential lateral movement and execution of malicious payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
