The user mentioned looking at the entire batch together. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process created. That's a normal Windows utility, so probably benign. Then, multiple 'powershell.exe' processes are being accessed, and some registry values are being set. But the key thing here is the command line in one of the processes: the user is using findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems suspicious because it's looking for passwords in files, which could be part of a credential harvesting attempt.\n\nThen, there are several image loads related to .NET frameworks and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading those DLLs might be normal, but combined with the other activities, it's worth noting. A temporary file is created and then deleted, which is common in scripts but could be a red flag if it's part of something malicious. The Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but could be used by malware.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line might indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's some logging happening. However, the main concern is the search for passwords in files. This could be a sign of an attacker trying to find sensitive information on the system. The combination of PowerShell being used for this, along with the file creation and deletion, and the registry changes, might suggest that this is part of a larger attack, like an attempt to exfiltrate data or establish persistence.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times could be a sign of automated scanning. The use of 'findstr' and 'select-string' in PowerShell is a common technique in attacks to search for sensitive data. The presence of multiple image loads from .NET and Defender might be normal, but if this is happening in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it's more concerning.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch does show some suspicious activities that could warrant further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I should check if there's anything suspicious there.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe and svchost.exe doing registry value sets. Notepad is common, but svchost hosting multiple services might be normal too. But then there's a lot of registry events, which could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe powershell.exe events stand out. There's a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for passwords in various file types. That's a classic sign of someone trying to find credentials on the system. Also, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the AppData directory, which could be where it's storing some data or scripts.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, so maybe it's a sign of something else. Also, the Dns query by OfficeClickToRun.exe might be normal, but if it's querying unusual domains, that could be bad. However, the logs don't specify the domains.\n\nThe key points here are the use of PowerShell for searching passwords and the creation of a file in a user's AppData folder. These are both suspicious activities that could indicate an attacker trying to exfiltrate data or establish persistence. The other events might be benign, but the combination of these specific actions makes me think this is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing credential search commands (findstr\/select-string for passwords) and creating files in user directories, suggesting potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe performing DNS queries. That's normal, but maybe if there were a lot, but here it's just a few. Then there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But wait, the same file path is mentioned twice. Maybe that's just a repeated event?\n\nThen, chrome.exe is involved in registry value sets. A lot of registry changes could be suspicious, but again, if it's just a few, maybe not. However, looking further, there are multiple entries (like 8 times) where chrome.exe sets registry values. That's a lot. Why would chrome.exe be changing the registry so many times? That might be unusual. Typically, browsers don't modify the registry that frequently unless there's some malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point: there's an image loaded from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's just a normal process. But then there's a whoami.exe execution. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably benign. However, if it's being called in an unusual context, maybe. But here, the command line is straightforward.\n\nAlso, there are several file creations by powershell.exe, like creating txt files in the Downloads folder. That's not necessarily bad, but if those files are part of some malicious payload, but the names are generic. However, the fact that there are multiple file creations and registry changes by chrome.exe might be a red flag.\n\nWait, the winlogbeat file is being created multiple times. Maybe that's part of normal operation. But the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe are more concerning. Maybe the attacker is trying to modify registry keys for persistence. Also, the number of registry events is high. Let me count: there are 8 entries where chrome.exe sets registry values. That's a lot. Even if some are normal, that many might indicate something malicious.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of whoami.exe might be part of a script trying to gather user information, but alone, it's not suspicious. However, combined with the registry changes and file creations, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe, along with file creations by powershell and winlogbeat, might indicate suspicious activity. The confidence is maybe around 0.7. Not 100% sure, but enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Chrome.exe performing excessive registry modifications (8 instances), which is atypical for a browser. 2) PowerShell and winlogbeat.exe creating files in user directories, potentially indicating data exfiltration or configuration tampering. 3) Repeated file creation events for .yml.new files, which may suggest log tampering or malicious configuration injection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities. The first event shows cmd.exe running schtasks to delete scheduled tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be suspicious if it's part of removing malicious tasks, but it's also possible that these tasks were legitimate and being removed for some reason. However, the use of redirection to nul suggests they don't want any output, which might be to hide their actions.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of schtasks.exe being used to delete other tasks, like \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" and \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". This pattern of deleting scheduled tasks might indicate an attempt to clean up after installing something, possibly malware. Scheduled tasks are often used by malware to persist across reboots, so deleting them could be part of a cleanup phase.\n\nThere's also a command using wmic to delete processes where the name is notepad.exe. Deleting processes might be part of terminating unwanted processes, but again, the use of redirection to nul could be hiding the output. The WMIC process here is loading some DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's interesting because amsi is part of the anti-malware system, and if a malicious process is loading it, maybe they're trying to bypass detection.\n\nThe presence of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess events might indicate that someone is trying to access or manipulate processes, which can be part of malicious activities. Also, multiple Registry value set events could suggest changes to the registry, which is a common way for malware to persist or modify system settings.\n\nHowever, I need to check if all these actions are part of legitimate system management or if they're indicative of malicious behavior. The repeated deletion of scheduled tasks and the use of commands that hide output (like >nul 2>&1) are red flags. Also, the use of WMIC to delete processes might be part of a larger attack, such as terminating security software processes or other malicious processes.\n\nBut wait, some of these actions could be part of a legitimate script that's cleaning up old tasks. However, the combination of multiple deletions, the use of redirection, and the involvement of processes like WMIC and PowerShell accessing processes might be more suspicious. The confidence here is a bit tricky. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the pattern of events is unusual enough to warrant further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75, as there are enough suspicious elements but not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe with output suppression, use of WMIC to delete processes (potentially hiding malicious activity), and repeated registry modifications.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event. Let's see, there are multiple entries with processes like powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe. The winlog tasks include Process Create, Process Access, and Registry value set. \n\nHmm, the command lines stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that runs \"net user \/del\" which is deleting user accounts. Similarly, other entries use \"net user\" with delete commands. That seems suspicious because deleting user accounts isn't normal behavior unless it's part of a legitimate admin task. But doing this multiple times, especially with different user names like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\", might indicate an attempt to remove user accounts, possibly as part of a privilege escalation or to cover tracks.\n\nAlso, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with these commands could be a red flag. The registry events might be related to changing permissions or settings. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious files being accessed, which is a bit confusing. But the actions themselves—deleting users—could be part of a larger attack, like a lateral movement or trying to eliminate evidence.\n\nWait, but why are there so many \"Process accessed\" events for powershell? That might be normal if the process is being monitored, but combined with the deletion commands, it's more concerning. Also, the presence of \"net1.exe\" which isn't a standard Windows tool might be a typo or a malicious binary. However, the command line for net1.exe is similar to net.exe, which is legitimate, but the path is \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\...\" which is normal. Hmm, maybe that's okay.\n\nBut the main issue is the repeated deletion of user accounts. In a normal scenario, you might see a few such commands during maintenance, but multiple deletions across different processes and times could indicate an automated script or attack. Also, the use of \"whoami.exe\" might be to check the current user context, which is common in attacks to confirm privileges.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of deleting user accounts through cmd and net commands, along with multiple process accesses and registry changes, suggests potential malicious activity. Even though there's no direct file access to known malicious files, the behavioral patterns are suspicious. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.85. The justification is the repeated user deletions and unusual process activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated use of 'net user \/del' commands to delete user accounts (e.g., 'tarefa_auxiliar_Admin', 'modulo_auxiliar_Admin'), frequent PowerShell and cmd.exe process creation with registry modification events, and potential lateral movement indicators.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities. One of the cmd.exe commands is deleting a service called 'win32times' using 'sc delete'. That stands out because deleting system services can be a sign of malicious activity, like removing a service that's part of a legitimate application or even a security tool.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be used to modify system configurations, possibly to hide the malware or alter system behavior. The fact that services.exe is involved in registry changes might be significant because services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's being used to modify registry keys in an unusual way, that could be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a file deletion event where 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe' is deleted from the Temp directory. Deleting files, especially after they've been executed, is a common tactic to remove evidence. The path mentioned is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp folder, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with 'Process accessed' events and registry changes might indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell for further actions, which is a common technique in attacks. Also, the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events for PowerShell might be related to the execution of scripts or commands that are part of the attack chain.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be normal system activities. For example, 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate command used to check user context. But when combined with other suspicious activities like service deletion and registry changes, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of deleting a service, modifying the registry, deleting temporary files, and using PowerShell in a way that's not typical for normal operations suggests that this could be a security incident. The confidence is high enough to classify this as interesting, but not 100% certain without more context. So I'd say \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of system service 'win32times' via sc.exe, frequent registry modifications, file deletion from Temp directory, and PowerShell process access events.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems like a no-op, maybe a test or something benign. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. That filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be part of a script policy test, but sometimes attackers use similar names to hide malicious scripts. However, the file is created and then immediately deleted, which could be a sign of something trying to clean up after itself. \n\nOther events include image loads of system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. Loading these might be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be suspicious. There's also a mention of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which might be related to security software, but again, depends on the context.\n\nThere are multiple ProcessAccess events and Registry value sets. While these can be normal, the high frequency might indicate something. Also, the presence of whoami.exe being executed a few times—this is a legitimate tool to check user context, but if it's being run repeatedly, maybe as part of privilege escalation attempts.\n\nHowever, looking at the overall picture, most of these events seem to be part of normal PowerShell operations, possibly including some testing or legitimate scripts. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of a script's normal operation, especially if it's testing script policies. The confidence here is a bit tricky. There's some suspicious elements, but not definitive proof of malicious activity. The events don't show clear indicators of compromise like unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or known malicious payloads. \n\nSo, considering all that, the batch might be interesting enough to warrant further investigation, but not highly suspicious. The classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6. The justification is the combination of PowerShell activities, temporary file creation\/deletion, and multiple process access events that could indicate testing or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process events with temporary file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and image loads that could indicate script-based activity or potential evasion techniques.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if they warrant an investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a bunch of process creation and access events. The most common processes mentioned are powershell.exe, whoami.exe, svchost.exe, and some others like calc.exe and chrome.exe. \n\nHmm, whoami.exe is a standard Windows command that displays the current user's identity. It's often used in scripts or by legitimate processes, but if it's being called in a suspicious context, that could be a red flag. However, in the logs here, it's just being executed normally from the system32 directory. So maybe that's not a problem.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and for malicious activities. However, just having multiple ProcessAccess events might not be enough to flag it as malicious. I need to check if there's any unusual activity here. The logs don't show any suspicious command lines or arguments for PowerShell, though. They just mention the process being accessed.\n\nLooking at the other processes, svchost.exe is a standard Windows process that hosts various system services. The Registry value set events for svchost.exe might be normal, but if there's a lot of them, it could indicate something. However, the logs don't show any specific changes that seem malicious.\n\nWait, there are two Image Load events for calc.exe and Calculator.exe, both loading urlmon.dll from the System32 directory. Urlmon.dll is part of the Windows URLMoniker package, which is used for handling URLs. But if a process like Calculator.exe is loading this DLL, is that normal? Well, Calculator.exe is a standard app, but maybe loading urlmon.dll isn't typical for it. However, I'm not sure if that's a red flag on its own. Maybe it's part of some legitimate functionality, or maybe it's being used in a different way here.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper used for collecting and forwarding logs. Creating a new configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of a normal update or setup process. Unless there's something unusual about the file's content, this might not be suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: there are multiple process accesses, some registry changes, DNS queries, and network connections from Chrome. But none of these events seem to indicate a clear attack pattern. No unusual command lines, no unexpected network destinations, no signs of privilege escalation or data exfiltration. The events are mostly routine system activities.\n\nHowever, the repetition of powershell.exe being accessed multiple times could be a sign. If PowerShell is being used in a way that's not typical, like executing scripts or commands that aren't part of normal operations, that would be a concern. But the logs here don't provide enough detail about the commands being run. They only mention the process name and the task type.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the presence of multiple Image Load events for Calculator.exe and calc.exe. Wait, calc.exe is the Windows Calculator, and Calculator.exe might be a different process? Maybe a typo or different version? But even so, loading urlmon.dll might be normal. I'm not certain, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The events are mostly standard system processes and legitimate activities. There's no evidence of command and control communications, unusual file modifications, or suspicious process behaviors. Therefore, it's probably not interesting for investigation. However, if the confidence is low, maybe I should check again. But given the information, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent standard system processes (e.g., whoami.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe) and routine activities like registry access, image loading, and network connections.
