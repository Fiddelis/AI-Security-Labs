{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those seem normal. Browsers and system services often make network connections and DNS queries. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nBut then I see the command line in one of the cmd.exe processes: adding a user with a domain and a password that looks like a temporary one. The command is \"net user pacote_principal_Admin registro_temporario_pass123! \/add \/domain\". That's a red flag. Creating a new user in the domain with a password that's probably weak or temporary. Also, the user might be adding someone to the Domain Admins group, which is a high-privilege group. That's a big security risk.\n\nLooking further, there's another cmd.exe command that adds \"elemento_comum_Admin\" to the Domain Admins group. Then, there's a net1.exe process, which seems like a typo or a malicious replacement for net.exe. The paths for net1.exe are pointing to system32, which is unusual because legitimate system tools are in that directory. If someone is using a renamed or malicious version of net.exe, that's a sign of compromise.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. While PowerShell is a common tool, excessive access or changes to the registry could indicate malicious activity. Additionally, the creation of a file named \"pacote_base.txt\" in the Downloads directory might be benign, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nThe svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log files is normal, as that's part of the System Resource Usage tracking. But the repetition of those events might just be routine logging.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of domain users, adding to Domain Admins, use of suspicious executables like net1.exe, and registry modifications are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these actions suggests a possible security incident, like an attacker trying to escalate privileges or establish persistence. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: domain user creation with weak passwords, addition of users to Domain Admins group, use of potentially malicious net1.exe (typosquatting of net.exe), and registry modifications. These indicate possible privilege escalation or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided three log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's normal for it to create configuration files. The path is in the Downloads folder, which might be okay, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here. The file is named .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary config file. Maybe it's part of an installation or update. Not sure yet, but not immediately alarming.\n\nThe second event is powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, but registry changes can be a red flag if they're unexpected. However, without more context, like which registry key was modified or what the value is, it's hard to tell. It could be a legitimate change, or maybe part of a script.\n\nThe third event is another registry access by powershell.exe. Again, accessing the registry isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a series of suspicious activities, it might be. But on its own, it's not conclusive.\n\nLooking at all three together, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The first event is a normal file creation by a legitimate process. The second and third involve PowerShell and registry changes, which are common in both legitimate and malicious contexts. However, without more data—like unusual command-line arguments, unexpected network activity, or other anomalies—it's hard to say these are malicious. The confidence here is low because the events don't clearly indicate a security threat. Maybe the user is just installing software or making configuration changes. But since there's no obvious malicious behavior, I'd classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity: winlogbeat creating a config file, and PowerShell interacting with the registry. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
