So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL entries, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several ProcessAccess events, which might be normal, but I should check for any suspicious activity. There's also a ProcessCreate event for whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command, but it's being run multiple times. However, the key thing here is the PowerShell activities.\n\nOne of the entries has a command line that looks like it's trying to create a new PSDrive with the path \\\\Target\\\\C$. That seems like it could be accessing a remote share, which might be part of a lateral movement or data exfiltration. Then there's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file, which is created and then immediately deleted. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces. \n\nAlso, there are ImageLoad events for some DLLs, which are normal, but the presence of multiple ImageLoads might indicate that PowerShell is loading additional components, possibly for malicious purposes. The repeated ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent entries might indicate that the process is modifying the registry or accessing other processes, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be part of normal system operations, especially if PowerShell is being used for legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of creating a temporary script, accessing a remote share, and the high frequency of PowerShell events raises a red flag. The deletion of the script file after creation is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as it's trying to avoid detection.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the events show a pattern that's consistent with a potential security incident, such as an attacker using PowerShell to execute scripts, access remote resources, and clean up traces.

The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the logs, there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first event shows a process creation with a command line that's a bit odd: \"& {}\". That might be a placeholder or a test, but not sure yet. Then there are several \"Image loaded\" events pointing to various DLLs, some related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but maybe there's something else.\n\nWait, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1, and then it's deleted. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to PowerShell script policy testing. But why create and delete it? Maybe a benign test, but sometimes attackers use temporary files to execute malicious scripts. However, the fact that it's deleted might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent entries. The presence of whoami.exe is normal, but the repeated PowerShell activities might indicate something. However, the command lines are mostly empty or standard. The ImageLoad events include legitimate system DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell operations, especially if it's using .NET.\n\nBut wait, the filename \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" could be a red flag. Maybe it's part of a script that's bypassing execution policies. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that the file is created and then deleted might be suspicious. Also, the multiple ImageLoad events might be part of normal operations, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it could be a sign of something.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of \"MpOAV.dll\" and \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so loading those might be normal. But if there's an unusual interaction with those files, that could be a problem. However, in these logs, it's just ImageLoad, which is normal.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There are some suspicious elements, like the temporary file creation and deletion, but without more evidence like unusual commands or network activity, it's hard to be certain. The events could be part of a legitimate process, like testing script policies. However, the repeated PowerShell activities and the specific filename might warrant further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe process creations, image loads of .NET-related DLLs, and temporary script file creation\/deletion suggest potential malicious activity, such as script execution attempts or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to system files like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute something temporarily and then clean up. The file name is a PowerShell script, which could be part of a malicious activity. However, the fact that it's created and deleted might be part of a legitimate process, but combined with other events, it could be a red flag.\n\nThere's also a 'Pipe Created' event, which isn't immediately suspicious on its own, but if combined with other actions, might indicate communication between processes. The 'Registry value set' event could be part of changing configurations, which might be benign or malicious depending on the context.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes, there's a check for the existence of 'procdump.exe' in a specific path. ProcDump is a legitimate tool used for capturing memory dumps, but if it's being used in a suspicious context or if the path is unusual, that could be a concern. However, the command here just checks if the file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain tools are present, which could be part of a larger attack plan.\n\nThe repeated 'Process accessed' events might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other processes, which could be normal, but in combination with the other events, it might suggest something more. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of a temporary file created and deleted, along with multiple image loads and process accesses, could be indicative of a script or malware trying to execute in memory (like a payload) without leaving traces. The use of PowerShell for such activities is common in attacks. However, since some of these are system files and the events could be part of normal operations, the confidence isn't 100%, but there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading various DLL files. One of them is clr.dll, which is part of the .NET Framework, so that's normal. Then there's System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, which is related to PowerShell, so that's also expected. The third one is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Hmm, that's a bit more suspicious. Why would PowerShell be loading a Windows Defender DLL? Maybe it's a legitimate action, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, there's a file deletion event for a temporary PowerShell script. Deleting a temp script might be normal if it's part of a cleanup, but sometimes attackers delete logs or temporary files to cover their tracks. Not sure yet, but need to check more.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently malicious, but if there's unusual activity here, it could be a red flag. The file is 'None' here, so maybe it's a named pipe, which is okay.\n\nFile creation in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's a standard location for PowerShell profiles, so that's normal. Process accessed events for PowerShell and other processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe event has a command to disable the firewall using netsh. Oh, that's a big red flag. Disabling the firewall is a clear sign of malicious activity, as it would allow unauthorized access.\n\nThen there are multiple registry events from svchost.exe. svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's modifying the registry, especially multiple times, that could indicate something like a service being altered or a registry key being added or deleted. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the firewall disable command, this might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: The most concerning event is the cmd.exe process disabling the firewall. That's a direct attempt to compromise the system's security. Even if other events are normal, this single action is enough to flag the batch as interesting. The presence of PowerShell loading various DLLs and the registry changes could be part of a broader attack, but the firewall disable is a clear indicator. The confidence is high because disabling the firewall is a strong signal of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a critical event where 'cmd.exe' executed a command to disable the Windows firewall (netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off), which is a clear indicator of malicious activity aimed at compromising system security.

All of them are from svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. The winlog task is \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\" each time. There's no file information provided.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is normal, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious. However, since all the events are the same and there's no indication of malicious activity like unexpected registry keys or unusual parameters, it could just be normal system behavior. Maybe a service is starting up or updating its configuration. But the repetition of the same event multiple times might be a red flag. However, without more context like the specific registry keys involved or other processes, it's hard to tell. The lack of file information also makes it harder to determine if there's a connection to malware. I think this might be a false positive or just normal activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are about svchost.exe triggering Registry events, like objects being added or deleted. There are a bunch of those, maybe 20 or so. Then there's a few entries where the task is \"Provider Lifecycle\" with a command line involving PowerShell and New-PSDrive. That command is creating a new PSDrive mapped to \\\\Target\\\\C$. \n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services. But if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious. However, svchost is common, so maybe it's just normal activity. But then there's the PowerShell commands. Creating a PSDrive to a remote machine's C$ share could be part of lateral movement or accessing remote systems. The command line has a typo maybe? \"unidade_auxiliar\" is Portuguese for \"auxiliary unit,\" but the correct parameter for New-PSDrive is -Root, not -unidade_auxiliar. That might be a red flag because it's an incorrect parameter, which could indicate a script error or possibly a malicious attempt.\n\nWait, the command line is using \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". The correct parameter is -Root, so that typo might be a mistake, but maybe the attacker is trying to map a network drive. If this is being done by svchost.exe, which is usually not used for such tasks, that's suspicious. Also, multiple instances of the same command line suggest automation or repeated attempts.\n\nBut then, the other entries are all svchost.exe with registry events. If those are all legitimate, maybe they're not a problem. But if they're part of a larger attack, like changing registry keys to persist or modify system behavior, that's bad. However, the logs don't show the specific registry keys being modified, just that an object was added or deleted. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but the combination of registry changes and the PowerShell command could be indicative of something malicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple entries with the same command line might indicate that the process is being used to establish a connection to a remote machine, which could be part of an attack. The \"Provider Lifecycle\" event might be related to the PowerShell provider, which is used for interacting with the file system. If this is done repeatedly, it might be an attempt to access files on the remote machine.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of svchost.exe doing registry changes is not necessarily bad, but combined with the PowerShell commands trying to map a remote drive, especially with a typo in the parameter, that raises suspicion. It's possible that this is a benign script with a typo, but in the context of security monitoring, such patterns are often seen in attacks. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. The justification would be the combination of registry events and the suspicious PowerShell command with potential typo.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple svchost.exe processes trigger registry events, and PowerShell commands attempt to map a remote drive (\\\\Target\\\\C$) with a suspicious parameter typo (-unidade_auxiliar instead of -Root), suggesting potential lateral movement or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to analyze the events as a whole.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several PowerShell commands. The first few entries have the command line 'powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}'. Wait, that path looks suspicious. The 'unidade_auxiliar' part might be a typo or obfuscation. The UNC path is pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$, which is a common pattern for accessing remote systems, maybe a lateral movement attempt. But I need to check if that's a legitimate use or something malicious.\n\nThen there are a bunch of entries with 'powershell.exe & {}', which is an empty script block. That might be a red herring or maybe part of a larger attack where the actual payload is elsewhere. But the empty script blocks themselves don't seem harmful unless they're part of a larger plan.\n\nFurther down, there are commands checking if 'procdump.exe' exists in a specific path: 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe'. The use of '..' in the path could be a way to traverse directories, possibly trying to access a file in a parent directory. ProcDump is a legitimate tool, but it's also used in malware for dumping processes. The fact that they're checking for its existence might indicate that the attacker is trying to use it for some purpose, like memory dumping, which is a common step in persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nThe tasks in the winlog are 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. I'm not exactly sure what those tasks refer to, but they might be related to some system components or services. However, the combination of the PowerShell commands and the paths being checked could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: The initial command creates a new PSDrive pointing to a remote system's C$ share, which is a common technique for lateral movement. Then, the repeated empty script blocks might be part of a larger script that's being executed in stages. The check for procdump.exe suggests that the attacker is looking to use that tool, which is a red flag. Even though some of the commands are empty, the presence of these specific paths and the use of PowerShell for network access and file checks indicate potential malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any legitimate reason for these commands. For example, if a legitimate script is using PowerShell to map drives and check for tools. But the combination of creating a PSDrive to a remote system and checking for procdump.exe seems suspicious. Also, the repetition of similar commands might indicate automated or scripted attacks.\n\nThe confidence level is a bit tricky. The presence of procdump check and the network drive mapping are strong indicators, but without more context (like other events or file access), it's a bit uncertain. But given the patterns observed, it's likely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to create a network drive mapping to a remote system's C$ share (suspicious UNC path) and repeatedly check for the presence of 'procdump.exe' in a potentially obfuscated directory structure, which is commonly associated with malicious memory dumping activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
