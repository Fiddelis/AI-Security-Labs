The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a powershell.exe process that's downloading files from GitHub using WebClient. The command line shows DownloadFile with URLs from raw.githubusercontent.com. That's a common technique for downloading files, but the paths are pointing to LICENSE.txt files. Wait, LICENSE.txt is a common file in repositories, but if it's being downloaded multiple times, maybe that's part of a script or something.\n\nLooking further, there's a process where powershell.exe is creating and then deleting a temporary file. The file is created in the Temp directory and then deleted. That could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving evidence. However, the file is named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be related to PowerShell script execution policies. Also, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require those DLLs.\n\nBut wait, the command lines in some entries have DownloadFile commands pointing to GitHub URLs. If those URLs are legitimate, it's not a problem. However, if the user is downloading executable files or scripts that aren't part of the normal system, that could be a red flag. But the files mentioned here are LICENSE.txt, which are typically text files. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used to download multiple files from different repositories might be part of a larger operation. Also, the presence of multiple FileCreate and FileDelete events could indicate that the attacker is trying to execute a script and then clean up traces.\n\nAnother thing is the use of the WebClient object in PowerShell. While not inherently malicious, it's often used in scripts for downloading files. The fact that there are multiple such events with different URLs might suggest that the system is being used to download various files, possibly for a larger attack. However, without more context, like the actual content of the downloaded files or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, there's legitimate activity with Chrome and PowerShell downloading license files. On the other hand, the repeated use of PowerShell to download files and the creation\/deletion of temporary files might be indicative of something more. But since the files are from GitHub and are named as LICENSE.txt, which are common, maybe it's not malicious. However, the presence of multiple such events and the use of PowerShell in a way that could be used for malicious purposes might still be worth investigating. \n\nSo, I think the confidence is moderate. It's not clearly malicious, but there are enough suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Hence, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub repositories using WebClient, which is suspicious for a browser but common in malicious scripts.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. The command lines in some of the entries involve downloading files from GitHub URLs using WebClient's DownloadFile method. For example, the first event has a command line that downloads a LICENSE.txt from a GitHub raw link to a temporary file. That's a common technique used in PowerShell for downloading payloads, which could be malicious.\n\nNow, the URLs mentioned are from GitHub, which is a legitimate source, but the fact that they're downloading files to the temporary directory might be a red flag. However, the file names are LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign. But the repetition of similar commands with different URLs (like the one from elemento_principal\/pacote_geral) might indicate an automated process or possibly a script that's being executed multiple times.\n\nAnother thing to note is the creation of files in user directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt and others. While creating files isn't inherently malicious, if these files are part of a larger attack chain, it could be concerning. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are also events related to Chrome.exe and Registry value sets, but those are repeated multiple times. The same goes for Registry events with RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe. These might be normal operations, but repeated registry changes could indicate some form of configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe presence of MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected might be related to Windows Defender, but it's worth checking if that's legitimate. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory could be part of a log collection process, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, the key points here are the multiple PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the use of DownloadFile in PowerShell is often associated with malicious activities, such as downloading and executing payloads. The fact that these downloads are happening multiple times with different URLs might indicate an attempt to execute multiple scripts or exfiltrate data.\n\nAdditionally, the creation of temporary files and the use of the $env:TEMP variable in the command lines could be part of a larger attack, such as downloading a malicious payload and executing it. However, the files being downloaded are named LICENSE.txt, which are usually harmless, so that might be a decoy or a false flag.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there's a moderate level of suspicion here. The repeated PowerShell activities involving downloading files from GitHub and creating temporary files could be indicative of malicious behavior, but without further evidence like execution of downloaded files, suspicious network traffic beyond the initial download, or other signs of compromise, it's not definitive. However, the presence of these activities is enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands to download files from GitHub URLs using WebClient.DownloadFile, which is a common technique in malicious scripts.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event and see what's happening. The majority of the events involve svchost.exe and powershell.exe with tasks related to registry value sets and process accesses. There's also some activity with cmd.exe, whoami.exe, schtasks.exe, and reg.exe. \n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so it's normal to see it, but if there are multiple registry changes, that might be suspicious. However, the same process being used multiple times could be part of normal operations. But then there's the use of powershell.exe, which is often used in both legitimate and malicious contexts. \n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries: \"cmd.exe \/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1\". Deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" might be part of cleanup after an attack. Also, there's a reg.exe command deleting a registry key under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, which is where startup programs are stored. Deleting a registry entry here could be an attempt to remove a persistence mechanism. \n\nAnother entry has schtasks.exe being executed with the same delete command. Scheduled tasks being deleted might be a sign that something is trying to remove traces of its presence. Also, the repeated use of powershell.exe and process access events could indicate that an attacker is trying to maintain access or execute commands. \n\nHowever, I need to check if these activities are normal. For example, deleting a scheduled task could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with other suspicious activities like registry deletions and multiple process accesses, it might be more indicative of malicious behavior. The presence of whoami.exe could be checking user privileges, which is common in attacks to determine the current user context. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but without more context, like IP addresses, user accounts, or other indicators, it's not conclusive. But the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and using PowerShell and cmd.exe in ways that could be part of an attack suggests that this is interesting. \n\nSo, I think the classification should be INTERESTING. The justification is the combination of suspicious registry deletions, scheduled task removals, and multiple process accesses that could indicate an attempt to remove persistence or execute malicious commands.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about PowerShell.exe. There are several entries with tasks like ProcessAccess, Registry value set, and ImageLoad. The ImageLoad events mention loading DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are legitimate Windows components, so maybe not a problem. But then there's a File created event with a temp file named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That seems odd. Why would PowerShell create a script file in the Temp directory? Also, there's a File Delete logged event for the same file. Maybe that's part of a normal operation, but combined with other events, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe & {}' which could be a red flag. The curly braces are often used in PowerShell for script blocks. But sometimes, attackers use them to execute commands. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that the process is being monitored or accessed in an unusual way.\n\nAnother thing is the Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but if there's a lot of them or in unexpected contexts, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is a legitimate tool, but if it's being used in conjunction with PowerShell in a way that's not typical, that might be worth looking into. However, in this batch, it's just a single ProcessCreate event, so not sure yet.\n\nThe classification needs to be based on the entire batch. There are several PowerShell events, some file operations in temp directories, and some registry changes. While some of these are normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or modify system settings. The temp file creation and deletion could be part of a script execution that's trying to clean up after itself. The repeated ProcessAccess and Registry events might suggest that the process is interacting with the system in a way that's not typical for normal operations.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to overinterpret. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Without more context like the actual commands executed or network activity, it's hard to be certain. However, the presence of multiple events related to PowerShell, combined with file operations in temporary directories and registry changes, might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n\nSo, the confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6.

Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe' with various tasks. The tasks include 'Registry value set', 'Process accessed', 'Image loaded', 'File created', and 'File Delete logged'. The 'Image loaded' events point to some .dll files, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but maybe there's something else here.\n\nLooking at the 'File created' event, there's a temporary file created in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts temporarily without leaving traces. The file name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. The presence of 'PSScriptPolicyTest' might be a red flag. Sometimes, attackers use names that mimic legitimate processes or test scripts to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Process accessed' events for 'powershell.exe', which could indicate that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, possibly trying to manipulate it. The 'Registry value set' events might be part of persistence mechanisms, where an attacker changes registry keys to ensure the malware runs on reboot.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the command 'powershell.exe & {}', which might be related to event logging or something else. But combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nHowever, there are also entries for 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', 'whoami.exe', and even 'Calculator.exe' and 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' with 'Registry value set' tasks. Some of these might be benign, like 'whoami.exe' just checking user privileges. But when combined with the PowerShell activities, it might indicate a more complex scenario.\n\nI need to check if there's any suspicious activity. The temporary file creation and deletion is suspicious. Also, multiple registry changes and process accesses could be part of an attack. However, without more context, like the actual content of the PowerShell scripts or the registry changes, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of these events does raise some flags.

Alright, let's start by scanning through the entries.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of entries related to chrome.exe with Registry value set events. That's a lot, but maybe normal? Chrome might modify the registry for its own purposes. But then I see several powershell.exe processes. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer, there's a process where PowerShell is creating a file in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known location for PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. That might be suspicious if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there's a command line that tries to remove a file named objeto_principal.zip from the TEMP directory. The use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is trying to delete a file without causing errors if it doesn't exist. That could be part of a cleanup process, but maybe also part of hiding evidence.\n\nAnother entry shows PowerShell creating a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1) and then immediately deleting it. That's odd. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. The filename includes \"ScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be a red herring or an attempt to mimic legitimate testing activities.\n\nThere are also Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them is normal when running PowerShell scripts that use .NET. Not necessarily suspicious on their own.\n\nThe presence of multiple Registry value set events for PowerShell might indicate changes to registry keys that could be used for persistence or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of PowerShell creating and deleting temporary files, along with the Registry modifications and the use of ErrorAction Ignore, could indicate an attempt to perform actions without leaving evidence.

The commands are using Remove-Item with paths like $env:TEMP\\componente_comum.zip, estrutura_comum.zip, etc. The fact that multiple files are being deleted from the TEMP folder might be normal, but when combined with other events, it could be a red flag. \n\nWait, but why would someone delete so many zip files? Maybe they're cleaning up after an installation or some temporary files. However, the repetition of similar commands might indicate automated or scripted activity. Also, the use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is trying to suppress any errors, which could be a sign that the script is trying to avoid detection if the files aren't present.\n\nThen there are other events involving chrome.exe loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender. If Chrome is loading these, maybe it's a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers might bypass AMSI, so this could be a point of interest. However, the logs here just show that the image is loaded, not necessarily any tampering.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a normal utility to check user context. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there's a File created event in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That might be part of normal PowerShell profile setup, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe other events are about registry value sets and process accesses. These are common in many applications, so not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious part is the multiple PowerShell commands deleting various zip files from the TEMP directory.

That's common in PowerShell operations, maybe part of a script execution. But then there are several \"Remove-Item\" commands in the command_line fields, which are deleting temporary files. That's normal for cleanup, but I need to check if there's any unusual pattern here.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, but no file involved. Not sure if that's relevant. Then, the events involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of normal operations, but maybe the file creation here is just part of its setup.\n\nLooking at the registry events and process accesses, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is a normal command to check user context. Chrome.exe has several registry value set events, which might be part of normal operations or extensions, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The main thing is that PowerShell is being used extensively, which can be a red flag. However, many of the activities seem to be standard, like loading system DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and using whoami. But the repetition of certain commands and the presence of multiple file operations might indicate something more. However, without any obvious signs of malicious activity like downloading executables, connecting to suspicious IPs, or unusual process behaviors, it's hard to say. The presence of MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender) might be part of legitimate security operations.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. The key here is that while some activities are normal, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, file creations and deletions, and registry changes might warrant further investigation, especially if this is out of the ordinary for the user's environment.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the events. There are multiple entries here. The majority of them involve processes like chrome.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe. The winlog tasks are mostly \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" or \"Process Create\". \n\nNow, I need to check for any suspicious activities. The first thing that stands out is the repeated \"Registry value set\" events by chrome.exe. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that might be unusual. However, sometimes legitimate activities can cause registry changes, but repeated entries might indicate something else.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The \"Process accessed\" events could be normal, but if there's a pattern, like multiple accesses in a short time, that might be a red flag. However, in this batch, they're spread out without timestamps, so I can't tell the timing. \n\nLooking at the whoami.exe processes, they're being created with the command line \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". Whoami is a standard command to get user information, so that's usually benign. However, if it's being called repeatedly, maybe there's an attempt to check user privileges or something like that. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's an entry for winlogbeat.exe creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (like .winlogbeat.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation. However, the file path is in the user's Downloads directory, which might be less secure. But if the user is setting up Winlogbeat, that's normal. \n\nAnother file created is \"pacote_ativo.txt\" by powershell.exe. The name \"pacote_ativo\" might be in Portuguese, possibly meaning \"active package\" or something similar. The file is in the Downloads folder. Without knowing what's in the file, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. However, creating files in Downloads isn't necessarily bad, but if the file contains malicious code, that's a problem. But since the logs don't include file content or further actions, it's unclear.\n\nNow, combining all these. The main red flags are the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe and the multiple powershell accesses. However, these could be part of normal operations, especially if the user is running scripts or configurations. The presence of whoami.exe might indicate someone checking user context, which isn't inherently bad. The file creations are part of setup processes, perhaps.\n\nBut since all these events are in a batch without timestamps, it's hard to determine if they're part of a sequence. However, the combination of multiple registry changes by a browser and frequent PowerShell activity might be suspicious. In a real scenario, I'd check for other indicators, like network activity, file hashes, or user context. But based solely on the given logs, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity, but enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple events that could indicate potential malicious behavior, even if they might have legitimate explanations. The confidence is medium, maybe around 0.6, since there's some suspicious activity but not conclusive proof.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe (unusual for a browser), frequent powershell.exe process access attempts, and creation of potential configuration files in user directories.
