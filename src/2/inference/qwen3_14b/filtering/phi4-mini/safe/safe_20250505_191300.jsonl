The first few entries are about MpCmdRun.exe creating files and loading images, which seems normal as that's part of Windows Defender. Then there's svchost.exe creating a file in the SoftwareDistribution folder, which is also typical for Windows Update activities.\n\nBut then I see Discord.exe doing several things. There's a file creation time change, which might be normal, but then multiple network connections detected. That's a lot of NetworkConnect events for Discord. Also, there are ProcessAccess events, which could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate the process. \n\nLooking further, there's a reg.exe querying the registry for Discord in the Run key. Then, another reg.exe command adding Discord to the Run key with a specific path. That seems suspicious because adding an entry to the Run key could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. The command line shows it's setting up an entry to launch Discord.exe via Update.exe, which might be a way to ensure the application starts automatically, possibly without the user's knowledge.\n\nAlso, there are multiple PipeEvent entries for Discord.exe, which could be related to inter-process communication, but in excess, that might indicate something malicious. The repeated NetworkConnect and ProcessAccess events could be signs of ongoing activity that's not normal for a legitimate application.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of modifying the registry to add a Run entry, numerous network connections, and process accesses might indicate that Discord is being used in a way that's not typical, possibly as a vector for malicious activity. However, it's also possible that this is just normal behavior if Discord is being used actively. But the high number of events and the registry modification raise flags. I'm leaning towards INTERESTING because the registry change and the volume of network activity could be indicative of something more than just regular usage.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving Discord.exe, including frequent network connections, process accesses, and registry modifications (adding a Run key entry).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user is asking if this is relevant for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the logs, almost all of them are related to Discord.exe. The events include network connections, process creation, file creation, image loading, and registry changes. But since it's all Discord, maybe it's just normal activity. However, there are a few things that stand out.\n\nFirst, there's a file created at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Discord\\\\app-1.0.9190\\\\modules\\\\discord_modules-1\\\\discord_modules\\\\index.js\". That's a JavaScript file in the Discord modules directory. While Discord does use JavaScript for some parts, creating a new file in the modules directory might be unusual. It could be part of an update or a legitimate module, but sometimes attackers might inject malicious code here.\n\nThen, there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events. Normally, processes being accessed isn't necessarily bad, but if it's happening repeatedly, it might indicate something like a process being manipulated or monitored. However, since it's Discord, which is a known application, this could be part of its normal operations, like interacting with other services or plugins.\n\nThe \"Image loaded\" events point to .node files, which are native modules for Node.js. Discord uses these for performance, so loading these modules is normal. But again, if there's any unexpected module being loaded, that could be a red flag. However, the paths here seem to be within the expected Discord directories.\n\nThere's also a \"Registry value set\" event. Changing registry values can be a sign of malware trying to persist or alter system settings. But again, if Discord is updating its own registry entries as part of its operation, that's normal. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is legitimate.\n\nAnother thing is the number of events. There are multiple network connections and process accesses. If this is a normal user running Discord, they might have many connections, but if there's a sudden spike or unusual activity, that's concerning. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious IP addresses or unusual network destinations.\n\nThe file creation times being changed might be part of normal operations, like updates or temporary files. However, the presence of .tmp files in the Network directory could be something to check. Sometimes, malware uses temporary files to store data, but again, Discord might generate these as part of its communication.\n\nConsidering all this, the majority of events are related to a legitimate application, Discord. However, the creation of files in modules directories and changes to registry values could be indicative of something suspicious. But without more context, such as unusual network destinations, unexpected processes, or other anomalies, it's hard to confirm. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some potentially suspicious events, they could be part of normal Discord operations. Therefore, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" but with a lower confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are related to legitimate Discord.exe operations (networking, file creation, process access) within expected directories. No malicious indicators (e.g., unexpected binaries, suspicious network destinations, or anomalous behavior) are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if they're worth investigating. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a bunch of entries where Discord.exe is accessing processes and making network connections. A lot of them are \"Network connection detected\" under the NetworkConnect rule. That's a lot of repeated events. But wait, Discord is a legitimate application, right? It's known to make network connections for communication. However, the sheer number of network connections might be a red flag. Like, if it's connecting multiple times in a short period, that could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's one event where taskhostw.exe loaded taskschd.dll. That's a normal system process, so maybe not an issue. But then there's another entry where winlogbeat.exe created a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. However, the path mentioned is in the Downloads directory, which sometimes can be a place for malicious activity, but not always. \n\nWait, there's also a FileCreateTime event for a temporary file in the Discord Network directory. Changing the creation time of a file could be an attempt to hide the file's true age, which is sometimes done by malware. That might be a sign of something malicious. \n\nBut then again, Discord might generate temporary files as part of its normal operations. The key is whether these events are abnormal for Discord. The user hasn't provided any context about the usual behavior of Discord on this system. Without that, it's hard to tell if the frequency of network connections is normal or not. \n\nHowever, the presence of multiple NetworkConnect events, especially so many of them, could indicate that Discord is communicating with many different servers or possibly exfiltrating data. The FileCreateTime changes might be benign, but combined with the high number of network connections, it could be a sign of something suspicious. \n\nI should also check if there are any other unusual processes. The sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll seems normal. The only other thing is the winlogbeat file creation, but that's probably part of a legitimate setup. \n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple network connections from Discord, which is a legitimate app, but the volume might be unusual. The FileCreateTime change could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's a bit tricky. But since the user is asking for a classification, I think the high number of network connections and the file time change might be enough to flag this as interesting. The confidence might be around 0.65, as there are some suspicious elements but also legitimate activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated network connection events from Discord.exe (potential exfiltration or C2 activity) combined with file creation time modification in Discord's temporary directory (possible tampering).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these two events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a common tool for log collection, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The second event is Discord.exe changing the creation time of a file in its cache storage. Changing file timestamps can be suspicious, especially if it's trying to hide the file's true creation time. However, some legitimate processes might do this for caching or temporary files.\n\nNow, considering both events together. The first is a standard file creation by a known tool. The second involves a change in file time by Discord. But Discord is a legitimate application, and the path is within its expected cache directories. There's no obvious malicious activity here. No unusual processes, no access to sensitive areas, no signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized access. Both events seem to be part of normal operations. So, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence since there's no clear indication of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Both events involve legitimate processes (winlogbeat and Discord) performing normal file operations in expected locations.
