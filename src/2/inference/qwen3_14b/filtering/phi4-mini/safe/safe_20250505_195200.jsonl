However, without more context, like known good behavior of SDXHelper.exe or other indicators of compromise, it's a bit tricky.

Also, the filenames have these long hashes, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual content or make it harder to track.\n\nAnother point is that all the files are being created by the same process. If this were a normal operation, maybe there would be a variety of processes involved, or at least some variation in the files being created. But here, it's consistent.

Maybe it's a legitimate part of some software, but I should check. The fact that it's creating so many files in the Office directory is a red flag. Office usually doesn't generate JavaScript files in those locations, especially with such naming patterns. The hashes in the filenames look like they could be unique identifiers, but the repetition of similar filenames might indicate that the same file is being created multiple times, which could be a sign of a loop or an attempt to overwrite or inject something.\n\nAnother thing is the path: AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages.

So, there's a bunch of events where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory.

Then there's one event where winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in managing solution packages, maybe for add-ins or something. Creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be part of installing or updating Office add-ins. The file names with hashes could be unique identifiers for different versions or packages.

Could be a duplicate, but maybe it's just a normal part of the process.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe event. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, part of the Elastic Stack. The file created is a .yml.new file in the Downloads folder. That might be part of configuring Winlogbeat, but creating a new config file could be normal if the user is setting it up. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. But in this batch, there's only one event related to Winlogbeat, and the rest are all SDXHelper.exe.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The key here is whether these file creations are part of legitimate software behavior or something malicious. SDXHelper.exe creating files in Office's SolutionPackages is likely normal for Office add-ins. However, the sheer number of files might be unusual. But maybe the user is installing multiple packages. The duplicate file entry might be an error in the logs or a real event. The presence of Winlogbeat is separate; unless there's more suspicious activity, it's probably just configuration.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The justification needs to be concise. The main points are: multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, possibly related to Office add-ins, and one Winlogbeat event. Since SDXHelper is legitimate, and the files are in expected locations, maybe it's not interesting. However, if the number of files is abnormal, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The confidence would be moderate. Alternatively, if the files are in a legitimate path and process, it's not interesting. But maybe the hash names are suspicious? Not sure.
