All the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" followed by a hash or some random string.\n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to Click-to-Run installations. So, it's a legitimate process. But why are so many files being created?\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the OfflineFiles subdirectory under PackageResources. The filenames seem to be unique hashes, which might be part of the installation or update process. However, the repetition of some filenames, like \"ae87eebba2f31a95fd1edc31590b1d6c.js\" appearing twice, could indicate a possible issue. Maybe a failed attempt to create the file, or maybe it's just a normal part of the process where files are generated multiple times.\n\nBut wait, the user hasn't mentioned any errors or unusual activity. All the events are just file creations. If this is part of a normal Office update, then it's not suspicious. However, if there's an unusually high number of files being created in a short time, that might be a red flag. But the logs here don't specify timestamps, so I can't tell if it's a sudden spike.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames are JavaScript files. If these are being created by a legitimate process, that's fine. But if an attacker is using a malicious script to create files with similar names, that could be a problem. However, without more context, like the source of the files or any other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, the fact that the same file is created multiple times might be normal in some scenarios, like during installation where files are generated and then replaced. But again, without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs themselves don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The process is legitimate, the location is part of Office's installation directory, and the files are likely part of the installation or update process.

Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process:**  \n   `SDXHelper.exe` is a known, legitimate component of Microsoft Office used during installation or updates. The file paths and naming conventions align with typical Click-to-Run operations.\n\n2. **File Naming and Repetition:**  \n   - The filenames use unique hashes (e.g., `7b2a1c...js`), which is common for generated resources during software deployment.  \n   - Some files (e.g., `ae87eebba2f31a95fd1edc31590b1d6c.js`) are logged twice. This could reflect redundant operations, retries, or normal installation behavior (e.g., caching or partial updates).\n\n3. **No Immediate Malicious Indicators:**  \n   - No anomalies like unexpected file types, unusual processes, or errors are present.  \n   - The activity is confined to a legitimate directory and does not involve system-wide changes or network communication.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs appear to represent **normal Office installation\/update activity**. The repetition of filenames and the volume of files created are consistent with Click-to-Run operations. **No clear signs of malicious behavior** are evident in the provided data.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- If this activity occurs **outside the context of a known Office update** or is accompanied by other suspicious logs (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized process execution), further investigation is warranted.  \n- Otherwise, this is likely benign and part of standard software deployment. \n\n**Final Verdict:** Not interesting (benign activity)."}

However, \"copilot\" could refer to Microsoft's Copilot feature, which is legitimate. The hashes in the filenames might be part of versioning or unique identifiers for different packages.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all under the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office installation files. Multiple files being created could be part of a normal update process. However, the repetition of some filenames (like excel-copilot-strings_006c486299344434e703f696d84009a4.js appearing twice) might indicate something, but maybe it's just multiple events logging the same file creation.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe being exploited.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file names are all similar, like excel-copilot-strings with different hashes. There are duplicates, like the same file path appearing twice. Then there's an entry for MdSched.exe, which is a Windows Search component, and a consent.exe loading amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. Also, there's a winlogbeat process creating a .yml.new file in Downloads.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, possibly related to updates or installations. However, the repeated creation of files with similar names might be normal if it's part of a legitimate process, like updating language packs or copilot features. But the duplication could be a red flag if it's an attempt to overwrite or hide files. However, without more context, like error messages or unusual behavior, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe MdSched.exe entry is normal as it's part of the Search service. Consent.exe loading amsi.dll is also standard, as amsi is used for scanning files. The winlogbeat event is about a configuration file being created, which might be part of setting up a log shipper, which is a legitimate activity.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned \"excel-copilot-strings\" files. Copilot is a feature in Office, so maybe these are related to that. However, the large number of files created might be unusual. Also, checking for any signs of malicious activity: are there any unexpected processes? The only other processes are MdSched, consent, and winlogbeat, which are all legitimate. No mention of network activity or other suspicious processes.\n\nAnother point: the same file being created multiple times could be a sign of a problem, but maybe it's just a retry or part of a normal operation. Without more info, it's hard to say. However, since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I should consider if there's enough to warrant further look.\n\nIn a real scenario, I might flag this for further analysis, especially if the files are being created in a non-standard location or if there's a high volume. But in this case, the files are in the expected Office directory, and the processes involved are legitimate. The duplication might be a minor issue but not necessarily malicious.\n\nSo, the answer would be that while there are multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe, they are in a legitimate directory and involve known processes. However, the duplication could be worth checking, but without more context, it's not a clear indicator of a threat. Therefore, it's somewhat interesting but not a strong sign of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** Low-Severity, Monitor for Further Activity  \n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe event log contains multiple entries involving **SDXHelper.exe** creating files named `excel-copilot-strings_*.js` in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory. These files appear to be part of a legitimate process related to **Microsoft Office updates or language packs** (e.g., \"Copilot\" features). However, the following observations warrant cautious monitoring:  \n\n1. **High Volume of File Creations:**  \n   - Over 15 entries show repeated file creation by **SDXHelper.exe** in the same directory. While this could indicate normal update operations, the **duplicate file paths** (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_2d573a22b4b370ede2e4b6a89ae53b2d.js` appearing twice) may suggest **retry logic**, **corruption**, or **unusual behavior**.  \n\n2. **Legitimate Processes Involved:**  \n   - **MdSched.exe** (Windows Search) and **consent.exe** (Windows Defender) are standard system components. The **amsi.dll** load is normal for antivirus scanning.  \n   - **winlogbeat.exe** creating a `.yml.new` file in `Downloads` is likely part of a **log-shipping configuration** (e.g., Elasticsearch).  \n\n3. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**  \n   - No suspicious processes, network activity, or anomalous file contents are reported in the provided logs.  \n   - The file paths and processes align with known Microsoft Office and Windows behavior.  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **Monitor for persistent or unusual activity** from **SDXHelper.exe** (e.g., unexpected network connections, file modifications outside the `SolutionPackages` directory).  \n- Verify if the repeated file creation is part of a **legitimate update** or if it correlates with **user-reported issues** (e.g., Office crashes, slow performance).  \n- If the files are **not associated with a known Office update**, further analysis (e.g., file hashing, process tree inspection) is warranted.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe logs do not indicate a clear security incident but show **potentially benign high-activity** from a legitimate process. Further context or correlation with other logs would improve threat assessment."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating various JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries for the same file names, like \"vendors~copilotchatdisplay_0610e48aa6403fd8dac18ee075133afe.js\" appearing twice. Also, some of the file names have \"excel-copilot-strings\" in them, which might be related to Microsoft Excel and some copilot feature.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or if it's something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, specifically related to the setup and installation of Office add-ins or solutions. However, the fact that it's creating so many JavaScript files, especially with names that look like they could be part of a web application or plugin, might be worth investigating.\n\nBut wait, the key here is the context. If these files are being created as part of an Office add-in installation, then it's normal. However, if the user hasn't installed any new Office add-ins or if this is happening repeatedly without user interaction, that could be a red flag. Also, the repetition of the same files might indicate that the process is either retrying or there's an error in the installation process.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory path: \"AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\". This is a known directory where Office stores add-ins and solutions. So, if these files are part of a legitimate add-in, then it's okay. However, if the files are from an unknown source or if there's an unusual number of files being created, that could be a sign of malware trying to inject scripts or modify Office behavior.\n\nBut looking at the file names again, they seem to be named in a way that's typical for web assetsâ€”like \"vendors~...\" which is common in JavaScript bundling tools like Webpack. This might suggest that the add-in is using modern web technologies, which is plausible for a legitimate Office add-in.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same file names could indicate that the installation is failing or that the process is being triggered multiple times unnecessarily. It's also possible that this is part of a normal update process, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn summary, while the presence of SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office directory is not inherently malicious, the high number of entries and repeated files might warrant further investigation. The user should check if they recently installed any Office add-ins or if there are any unexpected applications running. Additionally, scanning the system for malware could be a good precaution.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is creating multiple JavaScript files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Context**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate component of **Microsoft Office**, associated with the installation and management of Office add-ins, solutions, or plugins.\n   - The files are being created in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, which is a standard location for Office add-in-related files.\n\n2. **File Names**:\n   - Many files have names like `excel-copilot-strings_<hash>.js` and `vendors~<plugin-name>.js`, which resemble **JavaScript bundling patterns** (e.g., Webpack). These could be part of **Office add-ins** or plugins (e.g., \"Copilot\" features).\n   - The repetition of identical file names (e.g., `vendors~copilotchatdisplay_0610e48aa6403fd8dac18ee075133afe.js` appearing twice) may indicate **retries** or **installation errors**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Scenarios**\n1. **Legitimate Activity**:\n   - **Office Add-In Installation**: If the user recently installed or updated an Office add-in (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, a third-party plugin), this behavior is normal. The files could be part of the add-in's runtime or configuration.\n   - **Update Process**: Microsoft may push updates to Office solutions, which could involve temporary file creation.\n\n2. **Suspicious Activity**:\n   - **Malware Masquerading as Legitimate**: If the user has **not installed any new add-ins**, or if the files are from **unrecognized sources**, this could indicate malicious activity (e.g., malware injecting scripts into Office).\n   - **Excessive File Creation**: The high number of files (especially repeated ones) may suggest **unauthorized processes** or **malware attempting to persist** in the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Check for Recent Add-In Installations**:\n   - Verify if the user has recently installed or updated any Office add-ins (e.g., Copilot, Power Automate, or third-party tools).\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using **Windows Defender** or a trusted antivirus tool to rule out malware.\n\n3. **Monitor SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Use **Task Manager** or **Process Explorer** to check the **source** of the process and ensure it is located in a legitimate Microsoft directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office`).\n\n4. **Review File Contents**:\n   - If possible, inspect the contents of the JavaScript files (e.g., using a text editor) to ensure they are not obfuscated or contain suspicious code.\n\n5. **Check for Unusual Network Activity**:\n   - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Windows Firewall logs** to monitor if the process is communicating with unexpected external servers.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **SDXHelper.exe** creating JavaScript files in the Office directory is **not inherently malicious**, the **repetition of files** and **lack of clear user context** (e.g., recent add-in installation) warrant further investigation. If the activity is unexplained or accompanied by system anomalies (e.g., slow performance, unexpected behavior), **malware scanning** and **network monitoring** are critical next steps."}

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The first thing I notice is that all the events are about file creation, and the process involved is SDXHelper.exe. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's related to the setup and installation processes. But why are there so many file creations here? Let me check the file paths. They're all in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles subdirectory. That seems a bit unusual because typically, during installation, files might be extracted into temporary directories or specific installation folders. However, the presence of multiple files with names like \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" suggests they might be language packs or resource files for Excel Copilot, which is a feature in newer Office versions.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking whether this is suspicious. Let me think. If this is part of a legitimate Office installation or update, then these files could be part of the setup process. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same directory might be normal. However, the names of the files are quite specific. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" might be part of an update or a feature that requires those resources. \n\nOn the other hand, if SDXHelper.exe is being used to drop files in that directory, it could be a sign of something malicious, especially if the user didn't initiate an Office installation. But without more context, like the system's behavior, other logs, or if the user is experiencing issues, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother angle: Microsoft Office updates often involve downloading and extracting files. If this is during an update, then these files could be part of that process. However, the fact that all the files are in the OfflineFiles folder might be a bit odd. Typically, updates might use different directories. Also, the presence of multiple files with similar names could indicate that they are parts of a larger package being installed.\n\nBut considering that the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known legitimate process, and the files are in the expected Office directories, this might not be a security threat. However, the user should verify if they recently installed or updated Office, as this could be part of that process. If not, then it's worth investigating further to ensure that the process isn't being impersonated or if there's a malware using that name.\n\nIn conclusion, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is malicious. But based solely on the logs provided, the activity could be part of a legitimate Office installation or update. However, it's always good practice to check for any unexpected processes and ensure that the system is up to date with security patches.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (a legitimate component of Microsoft Office) is creating multiple files in the `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory under Microsoft Office's installation path.

It is typically involved in extracting and managing resources during setup or updates.\n\n2. **File Paths**:\n   - The files are created in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\...`, which is a standard directory for Office-related temporary files and resources.\n\n3. **File Names**:\n   - The files (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_...`, `vendors~researchnotebook.js`) appear to be **resource files** or **language packs** for Office features like Excel Copilot or Research Workspace. These are consistent with Microsoft's practice of deploying modular, localized components.\n\n4. **Activity Context**:\n   - The repeated file creation suggests an **Office update or installation** is in progress. The `OfflineFiles` directory is often used during updates to cache resources locally before deployment.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Suspicious?**\n- **No**, this activity is **likely legitimate** if:\n  - The user recently **installed or updated Microsoft Office**.\n  - The system is running a **supported version of Office** (e.g., Office 365, 2021, etc.).\n  - No other unusual processes or network activity are observed.\n\n- **Red Flags (if present)**:\n  - **Unprompted activity** (e.g., no recent Office installation\/update).\n  - **SDXHelper.exe** running from **non-standard paths** (e.g., not in `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office`).\n  - **Unusual file extensions** (e.g., `.js` files in `OfflineFiles` could indicate script injection if not expected).\n  - **High volume of files** or **unrecognized file names** (e.g., `vendors~sccserviceciq_...`).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Office Activity**:\n   - Check if an Office update or installation was recently initiated.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, there are a bunch of log entries here, all from the same process called SDXHelper.exe. Each entry says that a file was created in the same directory under the user's AppData folder. The files all have names starting with \"excel-copilot-strings_\" followed by a bunch of random characters and a .js extension. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that sometimes legitimate software uses helper processes, but sometimes malware does too. The fact that all these files are being created in the AppData directory might be suspicious because that's a common place for temporary files or user-specific data, but also a place where malware might hide.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all have a similar pattern. The \"excel-copilot-strings\" part makes me think of something related to Excel or a copilot feature, maybe a legitimate Microsoft product. But the random characters after that could be hashes or unique identifiers. However, if these files are being created in large numbers, that might be a red flag. Also, if they're all being created by the same process, that could indicate some kind of automated activity.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Maybe it's part of a software that's supposed to create these files. But without more context, it's hard to say. Another thing to consider is the timestamps. If all these files were created in a short period, that might be unusual. However, the logs here don't show timestamps, so I can't tell from that.\n\nAnother angle: the files are JavaScript files (.js). That's a common file type, but if they're being created in the AppData folder, maybe they're being used for some scripting purpose. However, if they're being created by a helper process, it's possible that they're part of some legitimate functionality, like caching or configuration.\n\nBut then again, malware often uses similar tactics. For example, creating numerous files with random names to avoid detection or to store malicious code. The fact that the same process is creating all these files might be a sign of a malicious process if it's not supposed to be doing that.\n\nI should also check if there are any known vulnerabilities or malware associated with SDXHelper.exe. Maybe a quick search would show if this process is linked to any malicious activities. However, since I can't perform actual searches, I have to rely on general knowledge.\n\nAnother thing to note is the directory path: \"AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\". That seems like a legitimate Microsoft Office directory. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate part of Office, then creating these files might be normal. However, the presence of so many files with random names might still be suspicious, depending on the context.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any information about the system's state, like if there are other suspicious processes or if antivirus has flagged anything. Without that, it's harder to determine. However, based solely on the logs provided, the key points are:\n\n1. Same process creating multiple files.\n2. Files in a legitimate-looking directory.\n3. File names with a pattern that could be legitimate (like generated strings) or malicious (random names).\n4. All files are .js, which are common but can be used for malicious purposes.\n\nIn security analysis, the creation of many files with random names in a short time can be a sign of malware, especially if the process is not known to do that. However, without more context, it's a bit of a toss-up. It's possible that this is a legitimate process, but the sheer number of files and the random naming might be a red flag. \n\nI should also consider that sometimes software uses these kinds of files for caching or temporary storage. For example, if a plugin or add-in is generating these files as part of its operation. However, if the process is not known to do that, or if the user hasn't installed any software that would do that, it might be malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while the presence of these files might be legitimate depending on the context, the pattern of creation by a single process with random file names is suspicious and could indicate malicious activity. Further investigation would be needed, such as checking the process's digital signature, verifying its origin, and looking for other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the File Creation Activity:**\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is creating numerous JavaScript (.js) files in the **Microsoft Office AppData directory** with names following the pattern `excel-copilot-strings_<random string>`. Below is a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and Location:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (commonly associated with Microsoft Office or third-party software).\n   - **Directory:** `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel` (a legitimate Office directory).\n\n2. **File Characteristics:**\n   - **File Type:** `.js` (JavaScript files, often used for scripting, caching, or configuration).\n   - **File Names:** Randomized strings (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_1a2b3c4d5e...`), which may indicate dynamic generation.\n\n3. **Volume and Pattern:**\n   - **High Volume:** Multiple files created by the same process in a short timeframe (if timestamps were available).\n   - **Randomization:** Names suggest potential for obfuscation or evasion of detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Legitimate Scenarios:**\n- **Office Add-ins or Plugins:** Legitimate software (e.g., Microsoft 365, Excel add-ins) might generate temporary or cached `.js` files for functionality.\n- **Scripting\/Caching:** The files could be part of a legitimate process like caching user-specific data or scripts for Excel.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators:**\n- **Unusual Behavior:** If `SDXHelper.exe` is not known to generate random `.js` files in this directory, this could indicate **malware**.\n- **Malware Tactics:** Malicious actors often use randomized filenames and AppData directories to evade detection or store payloads.\n- **Lack of Context:** No timestamps, process details, or user context are provided, making it harder to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy:**\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (via properties or tools like **Process Explorer**).\n   - Confirm if the process is part of a known, trusted application (e.g., Microsoft Office).\n\n2. **Investigate Further:**\n   - **Check for other suspicious processes** or network activity.\n   - Use **antivirus\/endpoint detection tools** to scan for malware.\n   - Monitor the AppData directory for unexpected changes.\n\n3. **Consider System Context:**\n   - If the user has recently installed untrusted software or clicked on suspicious links, this activity may be malicious.\n   - If the system is part of a corporate network, check for domain-level indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the directory and process name may align with legitimate software, the **high volume of randomized `.js` files** created by `SDXHelper.exe` raises **significant red flags**. This behavior is consistent with **malware** or **unusual legitimate software activity**. Further investigation is required to determine the true nature of the process. **Do not ignore this activity**â€”it could signal a security threat."}

The majority of the files are JavaScript files named similarly, like excel-copilot-strings_...js, located in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. There are also a couple of entries where winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these file creations are normal or suspicious. SDXHelper.exe â€“ I'm not immediately familiar with this process. Maybe it's part of some software, but if it's creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages folder, that could be related to Office add-ins or something similar. However, the filenames suggest they might be localization files or some kind of strings used by an application. But why so many? And why are they all being created by the same process?\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe entry. Winlogbeat is a known tool for collecting and forwarding logs. The file it's creating is a .yml.new file, which might be a configuration file. If this is part of a legitimate setup, like installing or configuring Winlogbeat, then it's normal. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the paths, the AppData directory is common for application data, so that's not necessarily suspicious. The Downloads folder is also a typical place for user-initiated downloads. But the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times by SDXHelper.exe might indicate something. Are these files being created repeatedly, maybe as part of a loop or an attempt to inject code?\n\nAnother point is the lack of other processes or events. There's no mention of network activity, registry changes, or other suspicious behaviors. But with just file creation events, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that so many files are being created by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory might be unusual. It's possible that this process is part of a legitimate application, but without more context, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlso, the names of the JavaScript files â€“ \"excel-copilot-strings\" â€“ could be related to a Microsoft Excel add-in or some kind of copilot feature. If the user has recently installed or updated Office, this might be normal. But if not, it could be a sign of malware trying to inject its own files.\n\nIn the absence of other indicators, the main concern here is the high number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe. Legitimate software usually doesn't create dozens of files in a short period. Additionally, the presence of Winlogbeat's file might be part of a legitimate monitoring setup, but again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say.\n\nSo, considering all this, the events might be benign if the user is installing or updating software that uses these files. However, the repetitive nature and the lack of other context make this suspicious. It would be worth checking if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, verifying the digital signature of the executable, and looking for other related events or network activity that might confirm if this is malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of File Creation Events:**\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity:**\n   - **Frequency:** 14 entries of files created by `SDXHelper.exe`, all named `excel-copilot-strings_...js` in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n   - **Possible Legitimacy:** \n     - The filenames suggest localization\/strings files, possibly related to a Microsoft Excel add-in (e.g., \"Copilot\" feature). \n     - If the user recently installed\/updated Office or a related tool, this could be normal.\n   - **Suspicious Patterns:**\n     - **Repetition:** The same file names are created multiple times (e.g., `d34ff895466e8e9698801615c375adf3.js` appears twice).\n     - **Unusual Volume:** Creating 14 files in a short period by a single process (SDXHelper.exe) is atypical for legitimate software.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity:**\n   - **Single Entry:** `winlogbeat.exe` creates a `.yml.new` config file in `Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data`.\n   - **Context:** Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection. The file creation aligns with typical configuration setup, assuming the user is installing\/configuring it.\n\n3. **Red Flags:**\n   - **Lack of Context:** No metadata (e.g., timestamps, user actions) indicates whether these files were user-initiated or automated.\n   - **SDXHelper.exe Unknown:** Not a widely recognized process. If not associated with a known application, this raises suspicion.\n   - **No Additional Indicators:** No network activity, registry changes, or user interaction events are mentioned, limiting the ability to confirm legitimacy.\n\n4. **Recommendations:**\n   - **Verify SDXHelper.exe:** Check if the executable is signed by a trusted developer. Use tools like VirusTotal or Windows Defender to scan the file.\n   - **Monitor Behavior:** Look for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network connections to unknown IPs, persistence mechanisms).\n   - **Investigate Winlogbeat:** Confirm if the Winlogbeat installation is legitimate and if the `.yml.new` file is part of a known configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe events are **potentially suspicious** due to the repetitive and high-volume file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`, which is not a well-known process. While the Winlogbeat activity appears legitimate, further investigation into SDXHelper.exe is warranted to rule out malware or unauthorized software."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that most of the events are about files being created in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The process involved is SDXHelper.exe, which I think is related to software distribution or something like that. \n\nNow, the first thing that comes to mind is that creating a lot of files in that directory might be normal if it's part of an installation or update process. But then again, if there's an unusual number of files or if the files have suspicious names, that could be a red flag. Let me check the file names. Most of them are .js files with long, seemingly random strings in the names. That's common for legitimate files, like scripts or resources, but sometimes malware also uses such naming to avoid detection.\n\nWait, but there's also a mention of \"office-iss\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which might be related to Office installations or updates. However, the repetition of some files being created multiple times, like the officeaicopilot-strings.min_01b8fae0e347988f62adc5207c7a379b.js appearing twice, could indicate something. Maybe it's a normal part of the process, but sometimes malware duplicates files to persist or spread.\n\nAnother point is the presence of SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Software Distribution service, which handles updates and installations. So if this is part of an update, it's normal. However, if the files being created are not part of a known update or if there's an unusual amount of activity, that might be a problem.\n\nBut looking at the logs, there's no indication of errors or unusual processes. All events are file creations under the SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office updates. The fact that there's a clean process (SDXHelper) doing this might be normal. However, the high number of files could be a sign of something. For example, if an update is being installed, but the number of files seems excessive.\n\nI should also check if the user has any context about recent installations or updates. Since I don't have that, I have to rely on the logs. The presence of multiple files with \"aicopilot\" in the name might be related to AI features in Office, which is a recent addition. So maybe this is just a legitimate update.\n\nBut then again, the fact that some files are duplicated (like the officeaicopilot-strings.min files) might be a red flag. However, in some cases, multiple copies could be part of the installation process, like different versions or language packs. Without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the directory path is \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\", which is part of the Office installation structure. So if this is part of an offline installation or update, it's normal. The SDXHelper.exe process is legitimate here.\n\nBut the key point is whether this activity is part of a known process. If the user's system is undergoing an Office update, this is normal. However, if this is happening without user initiation or in an unexpected context, it could be suspicious. Since the logs don't mention any other processes or errors, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity could be part of a legitimate Office update, the high number of files and the nature of the filenames might warrant further investigation. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But given that SDXHelper is a legitimate process and the files are in a known directory, it might not be a threat. Still, the repetition of files and the volume could be a sign to check for any unexpected updates or potential malware masquerading as legitimate files.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory, all initiated by the **SDXHelper.exe** process. Here's a structured analysis of the findings:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process Involvement**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known component of Microsoft's **Software Distribution Service**, responsible for managing updates and installations (e.g., Windows updates, Office patches). Its involvement here aligns with typical system maintenance activities.\n\n2. **File Locations and Names**:\n   - Files are created in the `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` subdirectory, a standard location for Office-related resources during updates or installations.\n   - Filenames include `.js` files with long, alphanumeric hashes (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_01b8fae0e347988f62adc5207c7a379b.js`). These hashes are common in legitimate software for versioning or localization purposes (e.g., AI-related features in newer Office versions).\n\n3. **File Duplication**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_01b8fae...js`) appear multiple times. While this could be part of an installation process (e.g., multiple language packs or versioning), it warrants scrutiny if the duplication is excessive or unexplained.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Volume of Files**:\n  - The sheer number of files created in a short time might be normal for a large update, but it could also indicate **malware mimicking legitimate processes** (e.g., droppers or persistence mechanisms).\n  \n- **Lack of Context**:\n  - Without additional information (e.g., recent Office updates, user-initiated installations), it is challenging to definitively classify the activity as benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with System Activity**:\n   - Check for recent Office updates, installations, or user-initiated software changes. If none occurred, investigate further.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **SIEM systems** to track SDXHelper.exe's behavior (e.g., network activity, registry modifications) and ensure it aligns with expected update workflows.\n\n3. **File Integrity Checks**:\n   - Verify the hashes of the created files against known good signatures (e.g., Microsoft's official repositories) to rule out tampering.\n\n4. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/malware detection tools to ensure SDXHelper.exe is not being exploited.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate**, given the involvement of SDXHelper.exe and the file paths. However, the **high volume of files and duplication** warrant further investigation to rule out **malicious activity masquerading as a legitimate process**. If no recent updates or installations are detected, consider this a low-priority alert but monitor closely."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this data. So, there are a bunch of log entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each entry is about a file being created in the same directory under the user's AppData folder. The files all have similar names, starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a long string of characters and ending with \".js\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on here. The process is SDXHelper.exe. I know that sometimes, malware uses names that sound like legitimate processes, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search tells me that SDXHelper.exe is associated with some software, maybe a helper for an application, but I'm not certain. However, the fact that it's creating so many JavaScript files in the AppData folder might be suspicious. Legitimate applications usually don't create that many files in the AppData directory, especially with such similar names.\n\nNext, looking at the file names: they all have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\". The term \"officeaicopilot\" doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a typo or a misinterpretation of a real term. Wait, \"Office AI Copilot\" is a feature in Microsoft 365, but the name here is different. It might be a fake name. The \".min\" in the filename suggests that these are minified JavaScript files, which are common in web development. However, creating minified files in the AppData folder is unusual for a normal application. Typically, these files would be part of a web application's assets, not stored locally on the user's machine.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of file names. Some entries have the same hash, like \"43ae0eacace4978cd3ca395f55abbc2f.js\" appearing twice. That might indicate that the same file is being created multiple times, which could be a sign of something trying to write the same data repeatedly, which is not typical behavior.\n\nAlso, the directory path is \"C:\\Users$$username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\js\". The \"Wef\" folder might be related to some Microsoft application, but I'm not sure. The presence of \"Microsoft\\Office\" in the path might be a red herring, but the files themselves don't seem to be part of any standard Office installation.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of malware, the creation of multiple JavaScript files in a non-standard location could be part of a payload. Malware sometimes uses JavaScript files to execute code or store data. However, without more context, like the contents of the files or the behavior of the SDXHelper.exe process, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAnother angle: the timestamps. If all these files were created around the same time, that could indicate a batch operation, which might be part of an installation or update process. But again, the volume and the nature of the files are concerning.\n\nI should also check if there are any known security threats associated with SDXHelper.exe. A quick search on virus databases or forums might show if this process is flagged as malicious. However, without access to those databases right now, I have to rely on analysis.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: multiple files created by the same process in a non-standard location, similar filenames with minified JS, possible repetition, and the process name which might be a mimic of a legitimate one. All these factors together could indicate a potential security issue, but more investigation would be needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events by the `SDXHelper.exe` process, generating numerous minified JavaScript files (`*.min.js`) in the `C:\\Users$$username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\js` directory. Here's a breakdown of the findings and implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and File Behavior**:\n   - **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is the source of all file creation events. This process is not a well-known Microsoft or third-party application, raising suspicion.\n   - **Files Created**: Over 20 JavaScript files with names like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` were created. The filenames suggest they are minified (compressed) JavaScript files, common in web development but unusual in local appdata directories.\n\n2. **File Repetition**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `43ae0eacace4978cd3ca395f55abbc2f.js`) appear multiple times, indicating redundant creation. This could signal a deliberate attempt to overwrite or replicate data.\n\n3. **Directory Path**:\n   - The files are stored in `C:\\Users$$username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\js`, a non-standard location for JavaScript files. The `Wef` subdirectory is not a typical part of Microsoft Office, which may be a red herring or a custom installation.\n\n4. **Filename Anomalies**:\n   - The prefix `officeaicopilot-strings` does not match known Microsoft or open-source projects. It might be a misspelling of \"Office AI Copilot\" (a feature in Microsoft 365), but this is speculative.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Malware Indicators**:\n  - **Unusual File Creation**: Legitimate applications rarely create many JavaScript files in AppData. This behavior is more common in malware for payload storage or execution.\n  - **Minified Files**: While minified JS is standard for web apps, their presence in local directories could indicate malicious scripts being injected or stored.\n  - **Hash Repetition**: Redundant file creation may suggest a payload being repeatedly written, which is atypical for normal software.\n\n- **Process Authenticity**:\n  - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a well-documented Microsoft process. If it is legitimate, its behavior (mass file creation in AppData) would be highly unusual. If it is malicious, it could be mimicking a legitimate process name to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (via properties > Details tab) to confirm its publisher. Untrusted or missing signatures are red flags.\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **VirusTotal** to scan the file for known threats.\n\n2. **Investigate File Contents**:\n   - Analyze the contents of the created `.min.js` files using a hex editor or JavaScript de-minifier. Look for obfuscated code, network requests, or suspicious functions.\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Use **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals tools** to track `SDXHelper.exe`'s network activity, registry access, or interactions with other processes.\n   - Check for unexpected system changes (e.g., new services, scheduled tasks, or registry keys).\n\n4. **Consider Malware Removal**:\n   - If the process is flagged as malicious or its behavior is unexplained, remove it immediately and clean the system using trusted antivirus tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe behavior described is highly suspicious and could indicate **malware activity**. The combination of mass file creation, unusual filenames, and the presence of minified JavaScript in a non-standard directory strongly suggests a potential security threat. Immediate investigation and removal of `SDXHelper.exe` are recommended unless it can be verified as a legitimate, benign process."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in a specific directory under Microsoft Office. The files are named with a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by a hexadecimal string. Some of the files are duplicated, like the one with \"90b26cdd531166e95e440a3f8250de19.js\" appearing twice.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or if it's something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, part of the Software Distribution service, which handles updates and installations. So, creating files in the Office directory might be related to updates or installations. However, the fact that there are multiple files being created, some duplicates, could indicate either normal operations or potential issues.\n\nI should check if these files are part of a known Microsoft update or installation package. If they are, then it's probably okay. But if they're not, maybe there's a problem. Also, the duplicate entries might be a red flag. Are they really duplicates, or is it just a log entry repetition? The user might be seeing these logs in an event viewer or a monitoring tool, and the duplicates could be a sign of a failed operation or a loop.\n\nAnother angle: the file names include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\". That looks like it could be related to a specific component, maybe a language pack or some localization files. The \".min\" extension is common in JavaScript for minified files, but in the context of Office, maybe it's a different purpose. However, the presence of multiple such files might be part of a larger package being installed.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of malware. Sometimes, malicious software uses legitimate-sounding names to hide their activities. However, SDXHelper.exe itself is a legitimate process, so unless the files are being created in an unusual location or have suspicious content, it might not be malware. But the user should verify the integrity of the files, maybe using checksums or comparing them to known good versions.\n\nAnother thought: the user might be running a script or a tool that's generating these logs. If the logs are from a monitoring tool, the duplicates could be due to the tool's configuration. Alternatively, the process might be trying to create a file that already exists, leading to repeated attempts, which could be an error.\n\nIn summary, the key points to consider are: the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, the nature of the files being created, the presence of duplicates, and whether this aligns with known Microsoft activities. If everything checks out, it's likely normal. If there are inconsistencies or unexpected behavior, further investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (a legitimate Microsoft component responsible for software distribution and updates) is creating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the **Microsoft Office** directory. Here's a breakdown of the situation and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimacy of the Activity**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is a **legitimate system process** used by Windows for installing updates, patches, or other software components (including Microsoft Office). It is not inherently malicious.\n- The files being created (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) may be part of **update packages, language packs, or localization files** for Microsoft Office. The `.min` extension is common for minified JavaScript files, but in this context, it could relate to internal Office components.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Duplicate File Entries**\n- Some entries show **duplicate file names** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_90b26cdd531166e95e440a3f8250de19.js` appearing twice). This could indicate:\n  - **Normal behavior**: The process may be attempting to create files that already exist (e.g., retries after a failed attempt).\n  - **Log duplication**: The logs themselves might be repetitive due to monitoring tools or logging configurations.\n  - **Potential issue**: If the duplicates are part of a **failed installation or update**, the process might be stuck in a loop.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Red Flags to Investigate**\nWhile the activity is likely legitimate, consider the following:\n- **File Integrity**: Verify the files' **checksums** (e.g., SHA-256 hashes) against known good versions from Microsoft. If they don't match, it could indicate tampering.\n- **Unusual Behavior**: If the system is experiencing **slow performance, crashes, or unexpected updates**, further investigation is warranted.\n- **Location of Files**: Ensure the files are created in the **expected Office directories** (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office` or `C:\\Windows\\Temp`). If they appear in unusual locations, this could be suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Steps to Take**\n1. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Check for **high CPU or disk usage** by SDXHelper.exe.\n   - Look for **error messages** in the Event Viewer (e.g., under **Windows Logs > Application** or **System**).\n\n2. **Verify File Integrity**:\n   - Use tools like **Microsoft Safety Scanner** or **Windows Defender** to scan for malware.\n   - Compare file hashes with Microsoft's official resources (if available).\n\n3. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Ensure the system is up to date with **Windows Update** and **Microsoft Office updates**. Outdated software may trigger unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Contact Microsoft Support**:\n   - If the files are part of a **custom or enterprise deployment**, consult Microsoft support for clarification.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate**, as SDXHelper.exe is a core Windows process. However, the **duplicate logs** and **unusual file names** warrant further investigation to rule out issues like failed updates, malware, or misconfigured software. If the system behaves normally, no action may be needed. If anomalies persist, deeper analysis is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of file creation events, all under the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files are in the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. Hmm, first, I need to figure out if these are normal activities or something suspicious.\n\nSo, looking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\...Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\\". That seems like a standard location for Office add-ins or solutions. The files have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" and \"word-copilot.min.js\". Wait, \"aicopilot\" and \"copilot\" â€“ that makes me think of Microsoft Copilot, which is an AI assistant integrated into Office. Maybe these are related to that?\n\nBut then, why are there so many files being created? The same file name appears twice, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_d4e700e1156c67b27923e16490b7d460.js\" twice. That might be a duplicate, which could be a red flag. Also, the hashes in the filenames look like unique identifiers, which is normal for some systems, but having duplicates might indicate an issue.\n\nNow, considering the process \"SDXHelper.exe\", I should check if that's a legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Solution Installer. It's responsible for installing and managing add-ins. So, if this process is creating these files, it might be part of a legitimate update or installation of Office Copilot or another add-in.\n\nHowever, there's a possibility of malware masquerading as a legitimate process. If the user isn't expecting these files or if there's an unusual number of them, that could be a sign of something malicious. But given that the files are in the correct directory and the process is associated with Office, it's more likely legitimate.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same file. If the system is creating the same file multiple times, maybe there's a problem with the installation or a loop in the process. But again, without more context, like system logs or user behavior, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI should also consider the timestamps. If all these files were created in a short period, that might be normal during an update. If spread out over a long time, that could be suspicious. But the user hasn't provided timestamps.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity seems to be related to legitimate Office operations, the repetition of files and the presence of numerous files might warrant further investigation. The user should check if they recently installed or updated Office Copilot or any add-ins, and verify the integrity of the files if they're concerned.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the creation of multiple `.min.js` files (likely JavaScript files for Office add-ins or AI integrations) by the `SDXHelper.exe` process, which is associated with Microsoft Office solutions. Here's a breakdown and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, responsible for managing add-ins, solutions, and updates (e.g., for features like **Microsoft Copilot** in Office 365). It is not inherently malicious.\n\n2. **File Paths**:\n   - The files are stored in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory, which is a standard location for Office add-ins and solutions. This aligns with legitimate operations.\n\n3. **File Names**:\n   - Files like `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` and `word-copilot.min.js` suggest they are related to **Microsoft Copilot** (an AI-powered assistant integrated into Office). The `.min.js` extension indicates minified JavaScript, common in web and application add-ins.\n\n4. **Duplicates**:\n   - The same file (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_d4e700e1156c67b27923e16490b7d460.js`) appears twice. This could be:\n     - A **normal part of an update** (e.g., multiple versions being cached temporarily).\n     - A **potential red flag** if the files are identical and created in rapid succession, possibly indicating a loop or error in the installation process.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Scenarios**\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - A **recent Office update or Copilot integration** may have triggered the creation of these files. The repetition could be due to a temporary caching issue or a failed installation attempt.\n  - The files might be part of a **development or testing phase** for a new Office feature.\n\n- **Suspicious Activity**:\n  - If the user **did not initiate** an Office update or Copilot installation, the repeated file creation could indicate:\n    - A **malware dropper** disguising itself as a legitimate Office process.\n    - A **compromised system** where malicious actors are injecting code into the Office environment.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Office Updates**:\n   - Check if the user recently installed an Office update or enabled **Microsoft Copilot** (via the Microsoft 365 admin center or personal settings).\n\n2. **Check File Integrity**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to scan the files and process for malware.\n   - Compare the files' hashes with known good hashes (if available) to confirm legitimacy.\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Look for unusual network activity, high CPU\/memory usage by `SDXHelper.exe`, or unexpected pop-ups\/behavior from Office applications.\n\n4. **Disable or Reinstall Add-ins**:\n   - If Copilot is not needed, disable it via **File > Account > Office Add-ins** in Excel\/Word.\n   - Reinstall Office to resolve potential corruption.\n\n5. **Contact Microsoft Support**:\n   - If the issue persists, escalate to Microsoft for further analysis, especially if the files are part of a known vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** if tied to a recent Office update or Copilot integration. However, the repetition of files and the absence of user-initiated changes warrant further investigation. Always ensure your system is up-to-date and protected by antivirus software."}

All the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files have names like word-copilot.min_... and officeaicopilot-strings.min_..., with different hash-like suffixes.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. Microsoft Office sometimes downloads and installs add-ins or updates, which might involve creating files in those directories. However, the repeated creation of multiple files with similar names could indicate something unusual. \n\nBut wait, looking at the paths, they are all within the user's AppData Local folder, which is typical for application data. The process SDXHelper.exe is part of the Office suite, so it's possible that these files are part of a legitimate update or installation process. However, the presence of multiple files with different hashes might be normal if they are different versions or resources.\n\nHowever, the fact that all these files are created by the same process in a short time frame might be suspicious. If this were a malicious activity, the attacker might be injecting malicious scripts. But the file names suggest they are minified JavaScript files, which could be part of a legitimate copilot feature or AI integration in Office. \n\nBut I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity. The justification for \"interesting\" would be if there's a pattern that deviates from normal. However, without additional context like other events (e.g., network connections, registry changes), it's hard to say. The files themselves don't have obviously malicious names, and the process is legitimate. \n\nBut the repetition of the same file being created twice (like word-copilot.min_2964af3c5a68dc6c600202a0762070c3.js) might be a red flag. Maybe a failed attempt or redundancy. However, it could just be a normal process. \n\nConsidering all this, the events might be part of a legitimate Office update. However, without more context, the classification is uncertain. But since all the events are related to file creation by a legitimate process in a typical location, maybe it's not interesting. However, the high number of files created could be a sign of something. Alternatively, maybe the SDXHelper.exe is being used for something else. \n\nBut I think the key here is that the files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is used for add-ins. If these are part of an add-in, then it's normal. However, if the add-in isn't supposed to be there, it might be a problem. But without knowing the user's environment, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn the absence of other suspicious activities, I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the process and location are legitimate. However, the justification would be that the events are consistent with normal Office operations, even though the number of files is high. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, but the volume might be a bit high.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which is consistent with normal Office add-in or update operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
