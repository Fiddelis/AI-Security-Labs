{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of what happened:\n\n1. **Initial Process Creation:**\n   - A new process was created with command line: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`\n   - This suggests that PowerShell was run with restricted execution policy and then it wrote the host message \"Final result: 1\".\n\n2. **Subsequent Process Activities:**\n   - Multiple processes were created with similar command lines, indicating they are from the same script or related scripts.\n   - The commands in these processes search for `.inf` files in the Windows directory (`$env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf'`). If they find a file containing `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]`, they set `$Res` to 1 and break the loop.\n   - Finally, they write-host \"Final result:\", followed by the value of `$Res`.\n\n3. **Winlog Tasks:**\n   - The winlog tasks indicate that these events were related to provider lifecycle (`Provider Lifecycle`) or engine lifecycle (`Engine Lifecycle`).\n\n4. **File Operations:**\n   - No file operations were reported in the logs, so it's unclear if any files were created or modified during these processes.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - Since all processes ended with writing-host \"Final result:\", followed by a value of `$Res`, we can infer that they checked for the presence of specific strings within `.inf` files and reported whether they found them or not.\n   - However, since none of the logs indicate what happened after these final results were written, it's unclear how these checks were used."}
