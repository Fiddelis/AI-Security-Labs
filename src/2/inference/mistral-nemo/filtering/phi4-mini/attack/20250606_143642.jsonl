This could be a reconnaissance step.\n     - Another instance executed a PowerShell command to remove files from the temp directory (`$env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip`). This behavior suggests an attempt to clean up traces after executing malicious activity.\n\n3. **Potential Threat Indicators**\n   - The presence of `sppsvc.exe` and `taskschd.dll` together might indicate the use of scheduled tasks for persistence.\n   - The execution of `whoami.exe` could suggest reconnaissance activities.\n   - The removal of files from the temp directory, specifically `entrada_principal.zip`, suggests that this file was likely used to deliver malware. Removing it after execution helps avoid detection.\n\nGiven these indicators, it's likely that a threat actor is attempting to perform reconnaissance and hide their activities by removing traces from the system. Further investigation is recommended to determine the full extent of the compromise and to identify any remaining malicious artifacts or backdoors."}
