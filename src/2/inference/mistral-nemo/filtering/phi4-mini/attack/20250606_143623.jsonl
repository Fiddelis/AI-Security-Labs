This could potentially be used for malicious activities like password theft or unauthorized access.\n\n3. **Registry Change:**\n   - The registry value at `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon` was changed from `Yes` to `No`.\n   - This change might affect the Windows login process or session management.\n\n4. **Process Termination:**\n   - A process named `cmd.exe` was terminated.\n   - Another process named `powershell.exe` was terminated shortly after starting.\n\n5. **Windows Update Agent Activity:**\n   - The Windows Update Agent performed an unknown activity (the log doesn't specify what it did).\n\nGiven the events, particularly the suspicious process creation and file deletions, it's recommended to:\n\n- Scan the system for any malicious software.\n- Check if there are any unauthorized or unusual changes in the registry.\n- Review recent activities on the computer to determine how these events occurred."}
