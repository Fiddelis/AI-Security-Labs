{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"**Analysis:**\n\nThe majority of the logs (18 out of 21) are related to a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", which is creating files in the same directory path. The files created all have names that follow the pattern \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hexadecimal hash>.js\". This suggests that these events could be part of an update or installation process for Office AI copilot.\n\nThe remaining 3 logs are:\n1. A registry value set event by \"chrome.exe\", which is likely related to Google Chrome browser.\n2. Another file creation event by \"SDXHelper.exe\" but the filename doesn't follow the previous pattern, suggesting it might be a different version or update of the same process.\n3. Another \"File created\" event by \"SDXHelper.exe\", also not following the previous pattern.\n\n**Interesting points:**\n\n- The repetition of certain events (like multiple creation of the same file) could indicate an attempt to evade detection by making it appear as normal operation noise.\n- The non-standard filename creation events might suggest a deviation from the norm, which could be worth investigating further for any potential security issues.\n\n**Suspiciousness:** Low to Medium. While the events are numerous and some deviate from the pattern, they are all related to a single process and follow a logical sequence of updates\/installations. However, further investigation might be warranted due to the non-standard filename creation events.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Monitor the system for any further unusual activities.\n- Keep an eye on the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process to see if it behaves normally after these events.\n- If possible, check the files created by \"SDXHelper.exe\" to ensure they are legitimate and not malicious in nature."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON objects, which seem to log the creation of files by a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", here's how I would classify and analyze this data:\n\n1. **Process Name:** All events are initiated by the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\".\n\n2. **Event Type:** All events are of the same type: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".\n\n3. **File Details:**\n   - The files created all have the following pattern in their names: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\".\n   - The hash values appear to be different for each file, suggesting that these are unique files being created.\n   - The files are located in the same directory: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\".\n\n4. **Time Stamp:** The provided data doesn't include timestamps, so we can't determine the frequency or order of file creations.\n\n5. **Classification:**\n   - Since all events are related to file creation by the same process in the same directory, and the files' names suggest they're related to Office AI copilot strings, this could be a legitimate part of software operation.\n   - However, the large number of unique files created might warrant further investigation to ensure it's not a malicious activity like rapid file generation used for DoS attacks or other forms of abuse.\n\n6. **Confidence Level:** Medium. While these events don't immediately scream \"malicious\", the high volume and uniqueness of files could indicate an issue requiring deeper investigation.\n\n7. **Recommended Actions:**\n   - Monitor this process and its file operations more closely.\n   - Check for any unusual behaviors or impacts on system performance.\n   - Review recent software updates or installations to understand why these files might be created.\n   - Consider performing a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus\/antimalware definitions if there's concern about potential threats."}
