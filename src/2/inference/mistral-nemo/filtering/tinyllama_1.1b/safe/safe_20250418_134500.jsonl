However, here are a few points to note:\n\n- Microsoft Edge was launched shortly after Chrome, which could indicate an automatic update or reset of browser settings.\n- The Microsoft Edge Update Service made several network connections but was terminated twice in quick succession, suggesting possible instability or unexpected behavior.\n- PowerShell accessed by an unknown process might warrant further investigation, depending on the context and other logs.\n- winlogbeat.exe was launched shortly after PowerShell, indicating that it might have been initiated by PowerShell. This could be normal if you're using ELK Stack for logging, but if not, further investigation is recommended.\n\nTo gain more context, consider looking into the associated events (file operations, network connections) and checking for any anomalies or unexpected behavior. Additionally, reviewing the contents of the created `.ndjson` file by winlogbeat.exe might provide more insights into its operation."}
