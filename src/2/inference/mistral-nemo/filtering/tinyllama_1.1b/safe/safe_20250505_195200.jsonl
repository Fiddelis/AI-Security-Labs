If it's unknown or malicious, you should stop and remove it.\n3. **Check Recently Installed Software:** Review the list of recently installed software on the system to see if this process is associated with any known legitimate programs.\n4. **Monitor File Activity:** Keep an eye on the 'OfflineFiles' directory for further JavaScript file creation or modification, as this could indicate ongoing malicious activity.\n5. **Backup Important Data:** If the files appear to be created by malware, backup important data before attempting removal in case data loss occurs during remediation efforts.\n6. **Report Findings:** Share your findings with IT\/security personnel if you're unsure about the legitimacy of 'SDXHelper.exe' or any created files."}

The files created seem to be minified JavaScript files related to Office's AI functionality, as indicated by the file names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\". Here's a breakdown of the events:\n\n1. **Process Name:** `SDXHelper.exe`\n   - This is likely a helper process for Microsoft Office, possibly used for managing or updating AI-related components.\n\n2. **Task:** `File created (rule: FileCreate)`\n   - The task logged here indicates that the specified files were created by the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process.\n\n3. **File Paths:**\n   - All file paths start with `\"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\"` and end with a unique hash followed by `.min.js` (assuming the extension is related to minified JavaScript files).\n   - The folder structure suggests that these files are part of Office's offline resources, possibly used for AI functionality when the application is running offline or without an internet connection.\n\n**Possible Trigger:**\nThese events might be triggered due to:\n\n- An update or patch installation for Microsoft Office.\n- First-time use of specific Office features that rely on these files (e.g., certain AI-powered functionalities).\n- A scheduled maintenance task or similar automated process related to Microsoft Office."}

Here's a simplified version of what's happening:\n\n1. The process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating various minimized JavaScript files (denoted by `.min_`) related to \"officeaicopilot-strings\".\n2. These files are located in the directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n3.

The creation of these files is logged twice for some hashes, which could indicate either a system error in logging or an actual double creation.\n\nTo understand why \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating these files and why there are duplicates, you might want to:\n\n- Check if any recent software updates or installations could be related to this activity.\n- Monitor the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" to see what triggers it to create these files.\n- Consult with your system administrator or the software vendor for clarification on this behavior."}
