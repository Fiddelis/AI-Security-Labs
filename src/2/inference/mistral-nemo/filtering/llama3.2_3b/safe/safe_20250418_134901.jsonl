The winlogbeat.exe process appears to have been started, and subsequently, a file (.winlogbeat.yml.new) was created in the specified path. After that, there's a registry value set event triggered by svchost.exe, which is a common host process for Windows services.\n\nThe absence of timestamps makes it challenging to determine the sequence or exact timing of these events. However, based on the tasks and processes involved, they likely occur in the order listed above."}
