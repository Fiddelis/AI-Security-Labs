{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's what happened:\n\n1. **Initial Event:**\n   - A Windows process was created with command line: `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand ...`.\n   - The encoded command seems to contain a script that creates and starts a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n2. **Subsequent Events:**\n   - Multiple events occurred with the same process ID, indicating that the initial command is being executed repeatedly.\n   - The events are labeled as 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', suggesting they relate to the Windows event log provider or engine.\n\n3. **Final Event:**\n   - A new process was created with command line: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`.\n   - This indicates that after executing the initial script, another PowerShell command is run to output \"Final result: 1\".\n\nIn summary, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in your system (CVE-2017-0190) to execute a script that creates and starts a new service. After this service creation, they likely ran some other command (outputting \"Final result: 1\") before closing the PowerShell process.\n\nTo mitigate future occurrences:\n- Patch your systems to address known vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0190.\n- Implement strict security measures for running scripts and executing processes.\n- Regularly monitor your system's event logs for suspicious activities."}
