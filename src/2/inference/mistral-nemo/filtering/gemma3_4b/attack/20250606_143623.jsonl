{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"These logs indicate a series of unusual activities on a Windows machine, possibly suggesting an attempt to create and start a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" (active_object in English) using PowerShell. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Windows Update Agent** - This is likely a normal activity as it's part of the Windows operating system.\n\n2. **powershell.exe with unusual command line** - The repeated command lines appear to be creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and then starting that service. The service is linked to an executable located at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This behavior is unusual as it suggests an attempt to run a hidden task or service, which could be malicious.\n\n   - *Note*: The fact that the command line appears multiple times in quick succession is also suspicious, suggesting automation or scripting of this operation.\n\n3. **powershell.exe with Write-Host command** - This final entry seems to indicate that the PowerShell script has completed its task and output a \"Final result: 1\". While not definitively malicious, it could suggest that the script was successful in performing its intended action (whatever that may be).\n\nGiven these logs, you should:\n\n- **Scan your system for malware** using reputable antivirus software.\n- **Check Task Manager** to see if there's a running service or process named \"objeto_ativo\" or \"tarefa_logico\".\n- **Review your startup items and services** to ensure nothing unusual has been added.\n- **Consider restoring your system from a previous, known good backup**, as this could indicate an infection that requires removal."}
