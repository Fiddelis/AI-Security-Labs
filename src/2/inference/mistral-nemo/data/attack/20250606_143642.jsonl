The PowerShell script created and deleted a file in the temp directory, and attempted to delete any `.zip` files named `entrada_principal.zip`.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check if there are any suspicious ZIP files in the temp directory or other locations.\n- Look for any related malicious scripts or files in the system.\n- Analyze the PowerShell script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` (if available) to understand its purpose and actions."}
