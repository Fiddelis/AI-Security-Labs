Here's what we can infer:\n\n- An attacker or malicious software is trying to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n- The binary path points to a file `tarefa_logico.exe` located in `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`.\n- These attempts started around 12:06 PM and continued repeatedly.\n- It's unclear why these attempts failed, but they might be due to permissions issues or other obstacles.\n\nTo mitigate this threat:\n\n- Check the file `tarefa_logico.exe` for malicious behavior. If found, remove it immediately.\n- Block or restrict PowerShell scripts from running on your system if possible.\n- Regularly update and patch your systems to protect against potential vulnerabilities.\n- Consider implementing application whitelisting to prevent unknown or unauthorized software from running.\n- Monitor your systems regularly for any unusual activity."}
