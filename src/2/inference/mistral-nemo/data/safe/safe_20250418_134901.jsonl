{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, here's a summary of the events that occurred:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Process and File Events:**\n   - Winlogbeat.exe was started.\n   - A new file `.winlogbeat.yml.new` was created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data`.\n\n2. **Process and Image Load Events:**\n   - `sppsvc.exe`: Loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n   - `notepad.exe`: Loaded `urlmon.dll`.\n   - Multiple processes (including `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and others) loaded various DLL files.\n\n3. **Registry Events:**\n   - Several processes (`svchost.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `Calculator.exe`) performed registry value sets.\n   - One event involved a registry object added or deleted by `svchost.exe`.\n\n4. **Dns Query Event:**\n   - `chrome.exe` performed a DNS query.\n\n5. **File Creation Event:**\n   - `setup.exe` created a temporary file in `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp`.\n\n6. **Other Events:**\n   - Some generic events like \"User Account Management\" and \"None\" were logged without specific details.\n\nThese logs suggest typical Windows system activity, including various processes loading DLLs, interacting with the registry, and performing network queries. The presence of multiple registry value set events by different processes is not uncommon but could indicate configuration changes or potential suspicious behavior depending on the context."}
