This further confirms that these files are related to Microsoft Office.\n\nIf you're concerned about these files or the process creating them, you might want to consider the following steps:\n\n- Check if there's an active update or feature rollout happening in your Office suite.\n- Monitor the `SDXHelper.exe` process to understand its behavior better. Is it running continuously, or does it start and stop?\n- If the files are causing any performance issues or errors, you might want to reach out to Microsoft support for further assistance.\n\nFor now, these logs seem to indicate regular file creation activity by a Microsoft Office-related process, but without more context, it's hard to provide a definitive analysis."}

Here's a summary of what's happening:\n\n1. The process `SDXHelper.exe` (likely associated with Microsoft Office applications) is creating various types of files.\n2. The files created are predominantly JavaScript files (with `.js`, `.min.js`, and `.json` extensions), suggesting they might be related to Office web app resources, strings, or offline files.\n3. Two different Office Solution Packages (`36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b` and `f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2`) are involved in these file creation activities.\n\n**JUDGEMENT:**\nThese logs are **normal** and do not indicate any security threats or unusual activities. They simply reflect the routine behavior of Office applications when handling localized resources, offline files, or web app components.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**\nNo action is required based on these logs. However, as always, it's essential to monitor system activities for any unexpected changes or patterns that could potentially indicate a security concern.\n\n** Confidence Level:** High"}
