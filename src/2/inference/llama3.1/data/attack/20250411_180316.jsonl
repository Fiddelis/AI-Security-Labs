{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the given log events, I have analyzed the batch as a whole and determined that it is relevant for investigation. Here's why:\n\nThe presence of multiple events related to the creation of files in the AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows directory (specifically, `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) by processes named `powershell.exe` raises suspicion. This could indicate an attempt to install a malicious script or payload.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated occurrence of network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect) events for the `chrome.exe` process suggests potential suspicious activity, possibly related to lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nConsidering these findings, I would classify this batch as:\n\n```\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious activity detected involving powershell.exe creating files in AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows directory and repeated network connection events for chrome.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
