{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This is a JSON log file that contains various system events and activities. Here's a breakdown of the contents:\n\n**Events**\n\nThe log file contains multiple events, each represented by a dictionary with three keys: `process`, `winlog`, and `file`. These keys correspond to the following information:\n\n* `process`: The process or application that triggered the event.\n* `winlog`: A Windows Event Log (Event ID) associated with the event.\n* `file`: Any related file operations, such as creation, modification, or deletion.\n\n**Notable events**\n\n1. **Process Creation**: There are multiple instances of the \"Process Create\" event, which indicates that a new process was created on the system.\n2. **PowerShell execution**: One event mentions a PowerShell script being executed with a command-line argument. The script creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it.\n3. **File operations**: There are several instances of file creation, modification, or deletion events. These might be related to the PowerShell script or other system activities.\n\n**Suspicious activity**\n\nOne event stands out as potentially suspicious:\n\n* **Process Creation**: The process is running with a command-line argument that includes `powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" ...`. This suggests that an attacker may have executed malicious code to create a new service on the system.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo investigate this further, consider:\n\n1. Reviewing the PowerShell script to understand its purpose and functionality.\n2. Checking the system for any signs of malware or unauthorized activity related to the \"objeto_ativo\" service.\n3. Analyzing the file operations to see if they are legitimate or part of a larger malicious campaign.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based solely on the provided JSON log snippet, and further investigation may be necessary to fully understand the context and significance of these events."}
