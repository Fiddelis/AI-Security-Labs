{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from an Elastic Stack (ELK) system, likely generated by Filebeat or Winlogbeat, which collects log data from Windows systems. The log contains various events, including process creations, registry value sets, image loads, DNS queries, and user account management activities.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the log entries:\n\n**Event format:**\n\nEach event consists of three parts:\n\n1. **process**: Information about the process that triggered the event (e.g., name, path).\n2. **winlog**: Details about the Windows event, including the task type (e.g., Process Create, Registry value set) and any additional information related to the event.\n3. **file**: Information about a file related to the event (e.g., path, creation time).\n\n**Types of events:**\n\n1. **Process-related events:**\n\t* `svchost.exe`: Windows system service host process\n\t* `sppsvc.exe`: Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) process\n\t* `chrome.exe`: Google Chrome browser process\n\t* `setup.exe`: Setup program for installing software\n\t* `smartscreen.exe`: SmartScreen filter process\n\t* `SDXHelper.exe`: SDX Helper process ( likely related to Windows Defender)\n2. **Registry-related events:**\n\t* Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent): Changes made to the Windows registry\n3. **File-related events:**\n\t* File created (rule: FileCreate): New files created on the system\n4. **DNS query events:**\n\t* Dns query (rule: DnsQuery): DNS queries initiated by processes on the system\n\n**Interesting observations:**\n\n1. Multiple instances of `chrome.exe` are seen setting registry values.\n2. A new file is created in the Winlogbeat configuration directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) by both `setup.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`.\n3. Processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `SDXHelper.exe` are seen loading images (DLLs) from the Windows System32 directory.\n\nThese observations might indicate potential security concerns, such as malware or unauthorized software installations, but a thorough investigation would be needed to determine the actual cause of these events."}
