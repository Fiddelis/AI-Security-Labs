{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file in JSON format, containing information about system events and processes on a Windows machine. Here's a breakdown of the structure and content:\n\n**Event Format**\n\nEach event is represented as a JSON object with three main keys: `process`, `winlog`, and `file`.\n\n* `process`: contains information about the process that triggered the event.\n* `winlog`: contains information about the Windows log event.\n* `file`: contains information about any files involved in the event.\n\n**Event Fields**\n\nEach field is a key-value pair within the `process`, `winlog`, or `file` object. Here are some common fields:\n\n* `name`: the name of the process.\n* `command_line`: the command line arguments used to launch the process (only present for PowerShell processes).\n* `task`: the Windows log event task description.\n* `path`: the path of a file involved in the event.\n\n**Example Events**\n\nLet's take a closer look at some example events:\n\n1. **Process Create**\n```json\n{\"process\": {\"name\": \"services.exe\"}, \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"}}\n```\nThis event indicates that a new process called `services.exe` was created.\n\n2. **Registry Value Set**\n```json\n{\"process\": {\"name\": \"svchost.exe\"}, \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"}}\n```\nThis event indicates that a registry value was modified in the context of the `svchost.exe` process.\n\n3. **File Access**\n```json\n{\"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"}, \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\"}}\n```\nThis event indicates that the `powershell.exe` process attempted to access a file or resource.\n\n4. **PowerShell Script Execution**\n```json\n{\"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\", \"command_line\": \"\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"\"}, \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"}}\n```\nThis event indicates that a PowerShell process was launched with the command line argument `C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe`.\n\n5. **File Creation**\n```json\n{\"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"}, \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"}, \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1\"}}\n```\nThis event indicates that a new file called `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` was created in the context of the PowerShell process.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to extract information from each event, such as process names, command line arguments, and file paths."}
