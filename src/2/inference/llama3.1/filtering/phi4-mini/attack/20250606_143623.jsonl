{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from an unknown security information and event management (SIEM) system or intrusion detection system (IDS). The log entries are in JSON format and contain various types of events, including process creation, registry value changes, and Windows logs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the different fields present in each log entry:\n\n1. `process`: This field contains information about the process that triggered the event. It can include fields like:\n\t* `name`: The name of the process.\n\t* `command_line`: The command line arguments used to run the process.\n2. `winlog`: This field contains Windows-specific events, such as registry value changes or system crashes. It can include fields like:\n\t* `task`: A description of the task that triggered the event (e.g., \"Process Create\" or \"Registry value set\").\n3. `file`: This field is usually empty and indicates that there was no file-related activity involved in the event.\n\nSome notable events from the log:\n\n1. **Execution of suspicious powershell script**: The log shows multiple instances of a powershell script being executed with the command line arguments `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"` and `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`. This script appears to create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path.\n2. **Registry value changes**: The log shows several instances of registry value changes, including the creation of new services.\n\nTo analyze this log further, you would need to:\n\n1. Review each event in detail and understand its context.\n2. Identify potential security threats or anomalies based on the events.\n3. Investigate any suspicious process creations or command line arguments.\n4. Check for any unusual registry value changes or system modifications.\n5. Consider correlating this log with other security logs, such as network traffic or firewall logs.\n\nPlease note that without more context about the SIEM\/IDS system and its configuration, it's challenging to provide a detailed analysis of these events."}
