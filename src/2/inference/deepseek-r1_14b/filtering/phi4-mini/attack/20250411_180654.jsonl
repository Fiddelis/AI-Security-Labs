{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell creating a file called \"objeto_temporario.txt\". That's a bit generic, but PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, so that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are several entries from chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome can modify the registry, frequent changes might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nNext, I see whoami.exe being executed. That's usually harmless, but when combined with other events, it could be part of a reconnaissance phase where an attacker checks user permissions or system info.\n\nAnother PowerShell event catches my attention because the command line includes executing a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is definitely malicious behavior. The fact that it writes logs to TEMP directory is also concerningâ€”it might be stealing credentials or other sensitive data.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing and loading various DLLs. While this can be normal for scripts, the combination with the Get-Keystrokes script makes me think these actions are part of malicious activities like loading additional modules or obfuscating code.\n\nThere are also \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from PowerShell commands. This could relate to how the script is initializing or interacting with system components, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nOverall, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity: suspicious file creation by PowerShell, repeated registry modifications, execution of a known keystroke logger script, and DLL loading that doesn't seem necessary for normal operations. The repetition and combination of these events make me highly confident that this batch is relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell execution with potentially malicious scripts, repeated registry modifications, and file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. Specifically, multiple entries show 'powershell.exe' in the process, and some have command lines that include paths like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This script name sounds suspicious because keystroke loggers are often used maliciously to capture user input, which could be sensitive information.\n\nThe tasks associated with these processes vary. Some are related to file operations like creation or deletion, others involve registry changes and loading DLLs like urlmon.dll. There's also an event where a remote command is executed, which can be a red flag because it might indicate unauthorized access or command execution.\n\nAdditionally, I see that some events mention files being created or deleted in temporary directories, such as the user's AppData folder. Temporary files can be part of malicious activities to avoid detection by antivirus software.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and frequency, there are multiple instances where similar PowerShell commands are run with slight variations in file paths. This repetition could indicate an automated script trying different approaches, possibly attempting persistence or lateral movement within the system.\n\nAnother point is the involvement of svchost.exe, which is a common process for services but can also be used maliciously to hide activities. The fact that it's creating files in certain locations might not be normal behavior and could be part of an attack vector.\n\nThere are some entries from winlogbeat.exe, which I know is related to log management tools. While this isn't inherently suspicious, the combination with other events makes me cautious about whether these logs are being manipulated or if there's a broader issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell scripts for potential keystroke logging, along with file and registry modifications, suggests possible malicious activity. The batch as a whole shows behavior that could indicate an attack, so it seems relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which may indicate keylogging activity. Suspicious file creation and deletion in temporary directories, along with registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
