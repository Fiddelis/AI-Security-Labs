The first thing that stands out is the multiple events related to powershell.exe being executed and accessed. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be a red flag for malicious activities because it has powerful capabilities.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line argument in one of the powershell.exe processes. It seems like it's encoding some text using XOR cipher with a specific key and then sending it via an HTTP POST request to example.com. This kind of activity is concerning because it might indicate data exfiltration or communication with a remote server, which are often signs of malicious behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there are several file operations: creating a temporary script file, deleting it immediately after creation, and opening various system files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These actions could be part of an attempt to load malicious code or bypass certain security measures.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe might suggest privilege escalation attempts or persistence mechanisms, which are typical in attacks. Also, the file delete event right after creating a temporary script is suspicious because it's a common tactic to avoid detection by leaving no trace behind.\n\nWhile not all these actions are inherently malicious, the combination of using powershell with encoded communication and multiple file operations raises red flags. The fact that the same process is involved in several potentially malicious activities strengthens the case for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including suspicious command-line arguments and file operations, indicate potential malicious activity such as data encoding and exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The key part to focus on here is the \"process\" field in each event.\n\nIn each process command line, there's a PowerShell script being executed. The script does several things that stand out. First, it takes plaintext data which includes a path and a file location (C:\\Users\\victim). Then, it encrypts this data using a simple XOR cipher with the key \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\". After encryption, it sends the ciphertext to example.com via an HTTP POST request.\n\nA few red flags here: \n- **Use of PowerShell**: While legitimate, PowerShell is often used in attacks because it can execute scripts and hide malicious activities.\n- **Encrypting Data**: Encrypting something might be normal for some applications, but XOR with a predictable key is weak encryption. This could indicate an attempt to obscure data before sending it elsewhere.\n- **Sending Data to example.com**: The domain \"example.com\" isn't a real server; it's often used as a placeholder. Receiving encrypted data here could mean the attacker is trying to exfiltrate data without being detected.\n\nLooking at multiple events, all are identical in their process command lines and event types. This repetition suggests automated behavior, possibly from a script or batch process meant to run multiple times to send data in chunks or to bypass certain detection mechanisms by spreading out activity.\n\nConsidering the file field is \"None\", there's no indication of file operations here, so it's less likely related to file-based attacks and more about network communications.\n\nPutting this all together, these events exhibit characteristics that are unusual for standard system operations. The encryption method used isn't strong, which might be intentional to avoid detection by simple checks. Sending data to a non-existent server could mean the attacker is testing exfiltration methods or part of a larger plan to send sensitive information elsewhere.\n\nThe fact that all events are identical also raises suspicion. Attackers often use repetitive patterns in their activities, making it easier for them to maintain persistence and ensure their payload runs successfully without drawing too much attention at once. \n\nTherefore, this batch shows potential signs of malicious activity, specifically related to data encryption and exfiltration using a common but dangerous tool like PowerShell. The combination of these factors makes the batch interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a PowerShell script that encrypts and sends data to an external domain, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm looking at each event one by one and considering how they might relate.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from powershell.exe with command lines that involve encryption using XOR with a specific key. That stands out because using custom encryption could be a sign of malicious activity, like encoding data to hide it before sending over the network. The fact that it's being sent via an HTTP POST request to example.com adds to my concern—it might be exfiltrating data.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is loading different DLLs, which seems normal for script execution but combined with other suspicious activities could indicate something more. Additionally, there are file creation and registry modification events involving various system processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe, which often have legitimate roles but can be abused by malware.\n\nThe presence of multiple RegistryEvent tasks is another red flag. Malicious actors often modify the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. The repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe might suggest some form of privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.\n\nLooking at other processes like conhost.exe and calc.exe, which are typically benign but can be repurcursed for malicious tasks, especially when paired with registry changes, adds to the suspicion. Notably, there's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe, which is an agent used for collecting logs—maybe it's being manipulated or its logs are being tampered with.\n\nPutting all these together, the combination of encrypted data transmission, multiple system process interactions, and repeated registry modifications suggests potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The goal is to return a single classification with justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, let's look at the individual events. There are multiple entries from different processes:\n\n1. ApplicationFrameHost.exe: Task is Registry value set.\n2. Calculator.exe: Also Registry value set.\n3. powershell.exe accessed process and later set a registry value.\n4. chrome.exe has several entries including Pipe Created, Registry value sets, and Image loaded events for specific DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll.\n\nLooking deeper, the same processes are appearing multiple times. Notably, chrome.exe is involved in many events, especially setting registry values repeatedly. This might be concerning because setting registry values can be a common tactic for malicious actors to modify system configurations or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, powershell.exe is another red flag since it's often used in scripts for various purposes, including malicious activities. The command line of one of the powershell.exe processes shows a script trying to remove a file with a specific path, which could be an attempt to delete logs or evidence of previous actions. Additionally, there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe process is creating a file, which seems normal as it's likely part of log shipping or monitoring tools, so that's probably benign.\n\nNow, putting all this together: repeated registry modifications by different processes could indicate potential malicious activity. The combination of using powershell.exe with specific commands and multiple registry changes across different executables suggests possible scripting or automation for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm a bit uncertain about the confidence level because while some activities are suspicious, others might be legitimate. For example, chrome.exe interacting with certain DLLs could be part of its normal operation. However, considering the frequency and combination of these events, especially from powershell.exe, it's leaning towards interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are from PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement and executing malicious scripts. There are multiple instances where PowerShell is loading images and creating files. For example, the file paths like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_temporario.txt' seem suspicious. Creating temporary files in user directories might be part of a script to hide or execute commands.\n\nThen there's the file creation and deletion events. PowerShell creates a temp file named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1', which is immediately deleted after it's created. This behavior is classic for avoiding detection by removing traces of malicious activity quickly.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see several Remove-Item commands in PowerShell. These are trying to delete batch files from various paths like \"C:\\componente_ativo\\pacote_base\\..\\\" and others. The use of \"-Force\" might indicate that these files were hidden or protected, which could be a way to remove evidence or disrupt system operations.\n\nAlso, the events mention registry value sets by chrome.exe multiple times. While Chrome itself isn't malicious, frequent changes to the registry can sometimes be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThe combination of these activities—creating and deleting files quickly, deleting specific script-related batch files, and using PowerShell's command line arguments—points towards potential malicious behavior. These actions don't seem like normal user activity, especially when they're repeated and involve known attack vectors like PowerShell abuse.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activities such as file deletion attempts, creation\/deletion of temporary files, and suspicious use of system tools. The confidence is high because multiple events align with common tactics used in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes show signs of malicious activity including file deletions, creation\/deletion of temporary files, and repeated attempts to remove specific batch files, which may indicate an attack or unauthorized system access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of process creations, especially with cmd.exe and powershell.exe. For example, there are multiple instances where cmd.exe is being used with commands like stopping and deleting services. That makes me think someone might be trying to remove traces of certain processes or disable some services, which could indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines in more detail, I see commands that delete files, stop services, and modify registry entries. The file deletion command, like \"del \/A:H %temp%\\tarefa_logico.txt\", suggests an attempt to remove a specific file from the temp directory. This is often something attackers do to clean up their tracks.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe with commands like Remove-Item indicates that they're executing PowerShell scripts which can be used for various malicious purposes, such as deleting files or registry entries. Additionally, multiple RegistryEvent tasks show modifications to the Windows Registry, which is a common tactic in persistence mechanisms—meaning attackers might be trying to maintain access to the system.\n\nI also notice several instances where whoami.exe is run without arguments. While it's a legitimate tool for checking user information, running it repeatedly could be part of reconnaissance or as a step in a larger attack chain.\n\nThe combination of these activities—deleting files, stopping services, modifying the registry—is concerning because they don't seem to align with normal user behavior. These actions are often associated with post-exploitation activities where attackers try to cover their tracks and establish persistence.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems like this batch of events is indeed indicative of malicious behavior.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries from different processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe. The tasks involve things like Process Create, File Delete logged, Registry value set, and Image loaded. I notice that cmd.exe is setting registry values and deleting a file named modulo_base.exe. That's a bit concerning because unusual file deletions can be signs of malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several events from powershell.exe. Powershell is often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The command line in some events shows that it's trying to remove a log file (key.log) from the TEMP directory. That might indicate an attempt to cover their tracks by deleting logs. Also, there are multiple File Create and Delete events related to a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1), which suggests something malicious is being executed.\n\nI also see that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate system files, the repeated Image Load events might be part of normal operation but could also be part of a script's execution flow. However, combined with other activities, it raises suspicion.\n\nThe fact that both cmd.exe and powershell.exe are involved in multiple tasks like registry changes and file operations is significant. Attackers often use a combination of tools to execute different parts of an attack. The repeated attempts to create or delete files, especially using command-line tools, could be part of installing malware or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events have the same task types, like RegistryEvent and FileDeleteDetected, which might indicate automated or script-driven behavior rather than manual user actions. This automation is a red flag in security because it's commonly used by attackers to carry out tasks without human intervention, making detection harder.\n\nIn summary, the combination of using powershell.exe for deleting files, creating temporary scripts, and cmd.exe for registry modifications and file deletions suggests possible malicious activity. The repeated events and the types of operations being performed are not typical everyday user actions and could be indicative of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including PowerShell command execution attempts, file deletions, registry modifications, and script-related actions.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, each line is a separate JSON object. There are multiple entries here, so I need to analyze them collectively rather than individually.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice several events where 'powershell.exe' is being executed with command lines that remove a file from the TEMP directory. The commands are using Remove-Item and have an ErrorAction set to Ignore, which might indicate they're trying to suppress errors if the file doesn't exist. This could be concerning because deleting files, especially in the TEMP directory, can sometimes be part of malicious activities.\n\nNext, there are events where 'powershell.exe' is involved in various tasks like creating processes, accessing registry values, and loading images. These aren't inherently bad, but when combined with other actions, they might raise flags. For example, multiple process creations or registry modifications could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also see entries involving 'conhost.exe' and 'whoami.exe'. Conhost is typically used for console windows, but sometimes it's exploited by malware to run scripts. The 'whoami.exe' is usually benign, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be worth looking into if there are unusual permissions or redirections.\n\nAnother point is that some events mention file deletions and path manipulations. For instance, deleting a PowerShell script in the TEMP directory (__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1) could be an attempt to remove evidence of malicious scripts or to prevent policy enforcement.\n\nI'm also noticing repeated patterns in the command lines, like using '& {' which sometimes is used to execute commands without output. This might be a tactic to avoid detection by not leaving traces in logs.\n\nLooking at the tasks in 'winlog', there are entries for Provider and Engine Lifecycle events, which could be normal PowerShell startup processes but also might indicate script injection or module loading issues.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple instances of deleting files with PS commands, process creations, registry modifications, and file deletions that might cover tracks. The repetition suggests automated or malicious behavior rather than legitimate use.\n\nHowever, there's no clear evidence of direct malicious activity like known exploit attempts, unusual network connections, or payload downloads. It could be a false positive if the user is running scripts normally, but the combination of actions seems more suspicious.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while not conclusive, the patterns suggest potential malicious behavior that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to delete files and access registry values, along with process creations, may indicate suspicious or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell and conhost.exe processes being created and accessing other processes. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so repeated use might be suspicious. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating profiles and accessing files, which could indicate script execution or lateral movement.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe being executed several times with the same command line. Whoami is usually harmless, but when combined with PowerShell, it might be part of credential dumping or information gathering by attackers.\n\nAlso, I notice registry value sets in both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided), if these events are happening within a short period, it could indicate coordinated activity rather than normal usage.\n\nConsidering all these together—repeated PowerShell executions with command lines that aren't clear, use of whoami.exe, and registry modifications—it's possible that this batch shows signs of malicious behavior.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are five events in total. Each is a JSON object with process details, Windows log information, and file data.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's PowerShell.exe being accessed via ProcessAccess rule. I know that PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious since it has scripting capabilities that attackers might abuse for command and control or lateral movement.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\". Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack component used for log shipping. Its process accessing files isn't unusual, but creating a new config file might indicate configuration changes or setup.\n\nThird and fourth events again show PowerShell.exe accessed and whoami.exe being executed. The whoami.exe command is straightforward—it's typically used to check user information. However, when combined with other activities, it could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation. But on its own, it's not suspicious.\n\nThe fifth event repeats the ProcessAccess for PowerShell.exe. Now, considering all events together: multiple instances of PowerShell.exe being accessed, along with a legitimate process (winlogbeat) and whoami.exe execution. While each event individually might seem benign, the pattern—especially repeated access to PowerShell which is often used maliciously—is concerning.\n\nI'm thinking about potential red flags here. The use of ProcessAccess for PowerShell could mean it's attempting to run scripts or execute commands. The multiple accesses might indicate an attempt at persistence or lateral movement within a network. Also, considering that the events are part of a batch, they could be sequential steps in an attack chain.\n\nI should also consider if there's any missing data. For example, if these events occurred over a short period, it might indicate a quick succession of malicious activities. Additionally, the exact commands or arguments for PowerShell aren't provided, which makes it harder to assess intent, but repeated accesses are still notable.\n\nIn terms of confidence level: I'm not entirely sure if each event is malicious without more context, like the actual commands run by PowerShell or the source of these processes. But given that multiple ProcessAccess events on PowerShell and the execution of whoami.exe could be part of a larger attack pattern, it's worth investigating further.\n\nSo, balancing all this, I think the batch is interesting because there are several red flags: repeated use of PowerShell which is commonly used in attacks, and the presence of other processes that might be part of an attack chain. The confidence isn't too high since some events could be legitimate, but there's enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessed and whoami.exe executed, potentially indicating malicious activity or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
