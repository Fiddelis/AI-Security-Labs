The user is asking me to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. They want only one classification, justification, and confidence score in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That's normal for system processes, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext up is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator executing and accessing such a file might seem odd, but I know some legitimate apps use URL handling components, so it's probably okay.\n\nNotepad.exe setting a registry value—wait, Notepad isn't known to do that often. But maybe in certain configurations or if it's part of a script. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nSVCHOST.exe is involved again; since it's a common process for services, and it's setting registry values. Again, normal behavior unless there are other red flags.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file seems legitimate since it's an ELK component used for log management. So that's fine.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing a process—Powershell is commonly used by attackers, but not all uses are malicious. But I need to see more context here.\n\nWhoami.exe running with its usual command line doesn't raise any alarms; it's a standard user info tool.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both setting registry values—these are UI-related processes. They might tweak some settings, so it's not unusual.\n\nAnother Powershell event accessing something—again, just monitoring how many times it appears.\n\nChrome.exe creating pipes and modifying registry is normal for browser activities, especially if they're handling plugins or extensions.\n\nThe cmd.exe command line catches my eye: \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". Using WMIC to delete processes can be a sign of malicious activity. This might indicate someone trying to terminate Notepad.exe remotely, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe creating a process to delete notepad.exe again, and loading MpOAV.dll—this DLL is from Windows Defender, so that seems legitimate. But the repeated use of WMIC for process deletion is concerning.\n\nOther events with chrome.exe modifying registry are standard behavior for browser updates or extensions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the cmd and WMIC processes attempting to delete Notepad.exe multiple times could be a red flag. This kind of activity might indicate someone trying to cover their tracks or disrupt normal operations, which could be signs of an attack. Powershell is also appearing multiple times, but without more context on what commands were run, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of using cmd and WMIC to delete processes suggests potential malicious intent, so I would classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process deletion attempts targeting Notepad.exe using both cmd.exe and WMIC.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some process activity on a system. My goal is to analyze all these together and decide if they merit investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any patterns or red flags. \n\nThe first few events involve 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's usually a benign command used to check user information, so nothing suspicious there. Then there are multiple entries for 'powershell.exe' accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is often used by administrators but can also be a vector for attacks, especially if it's making changes to system configurations.\n\nI notice several instances where 'cmd.exe' is used with commands like copying files or deleting scheduled tasks. For example, one command deletes a task named 'win32times'. That seems a bit unusual because why would someone delete such a task? Maybe trying to cover tracks or disrupt normal operations.\n\nThere are also events where various executables like 'schtasks.exe', 'svchost.exe', and 'conhost.exe' are involved in registry modifications. These tools can be legitimate but their repeated use might indicate an attacker tweaking system settings to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, I see that these events occur across different times, which could suggest a prolonged period of activity. This makes me think about whether this is part of a longer campaign rather than isolated incidents.\n\nThe fact that multiple processes are accessing and modifying the registry stands out. Registry modifications can be critical because they affect system configurations and can be used for persistence. The repeated use of 'powershell.exe' with registry edits especially raises a red flag. Attackers often use PowerShell for its versatility and to avoid detection, so this could indicate malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the deletion of tasks using schtasks. Deleting scheduled tasks might be an attempt to remove monitoring tools or disable security mechanisms, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nWhile some events like 'chrome.exe' loading a DLL might seem normal, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me lean towards this being malicious. It's hard to imagine legitimate activity that would involve so many different processes making registry changes and deleting tasks.\n\nI'm also considering if there are any indicators of known attack patterns here. The use of multiple tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and schtasks.exe, along with registry modifications, is reminiscent of post-exploitation activities where attackers escalate privileges and establish persistence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows a series of actions that could be part of an attack chain: initial access, privilege escalation, defense evasion, etc. The repeated use of PowerShell for registry changes, deletion of tasks, and command-line tools to modify files all point towards potentially malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process activity, including PowerShell registry modifications and deletions of scheduled tasks, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events involve either `powershell.exe` or `chrome.exe`. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any unusual activity with it should raise an eyebrow. Chrome, on the other hand, is more commonly associated with browser operations, but seeing multiple registry changes might still be worth noting.\n\nLooking at the specific actions logged:\n\n1. There are several events where `powershell.exe` loads different files, creates files, deletes them, and interacts with the registry. For example, one event shows a file being created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`, which is a common temporary directory. Temporary files can be part of legitimate processes, but if they're deleted right after creation, that might indicate something suspicious like an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n2. The events where `powershell.exe` checks for the existence of certain files and exits based on their presence (`Test-Path`) could be part of a script checking if previous malicious scripts were installed. This behavior isn't necessarily bad, but it's definitely worth monitoring as attackers often use such checks to ensure persistence.\n\n3. There are multiple instances where `chrome.exe` is modifying the registry. While Chrome does make some registry changes during normal operation, doing so repeatedly and without clear purpose could be a red flag. Especially if these changes are in areas that control system behavior or startup processes.\n\n4. One event stands out where Powershell creates a new item in a specific path and sets content to \"dir\". That seems odd because it's writing a simple command (\"dir\") to a batch file, which might be part of a script execution flow. If this is happening without user interaction, it could indicate automated or malicious script activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of multiple registry modifications by Chrome and Powershell's file manipulations, especially temporary files being created and deleted, suggests possible malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to access or modify system components could be signs of a persistent threat trying to stay undetected or establish persistence.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these actions might be part of legitimate operations, like script testing or automated processes. But given the frequency and the specific paths involved, it's more likely than not that there's something unusual going on here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation, deletion, registry modifications, and script execution indicate potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events. First, I notice multiple PowerShell processes with various command lines creating and writing to different script files. This could be a red flag since PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the file paths like \"C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo..\", they seem unusual and might indicate an attempt to create or modify scripts in non-standard locations, which is concerning. The repeated use of New-Item and Set-Content cmdlets suggests automated script creation, possibly for persistence or malicious scripting.\n\nThere's also a FileDeleteDetected event where PowerShell deletes a file it created. This behavior can help avoid detection by removing traces of the activity, which is typical in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events for known DLLs like clr.dll and MpClient.dll, which might be standard operations but could be part of a larger malicious process if combined with other activities.\n\nThe presence of Registry value changes by conhost.exe stands out. While conhost is generally benign, any registry modification without clear justification raises suspicion, especially when paired with the other events.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple script creations and deletions, unusual file paths, repeated command patterns—it's highly indicative of potential malicious behavior or at least suspicious activity that merits closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating and deleting files, including scripts in non-standard locations.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, most of the events are related to PowerShell executions. Each event shows powershell.exe being run with command lines that check for specific files in different paths. These checks exit with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. This repeated pattern seems suspicious because attackers often use such checks to ensure certain files exist before proceeding.\n\nThere's also a deletion of a PowerShell script file from the user's Temp directory, which is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. That could be an attempt to remove evidence or prevent detection of malicious scripts. Additionally, there are registry accesses and image loads that might indicate attempts to load malicious modules or bypass security measures.\n\nThe events occur multiple times with varying file paths being checked, suggesting a possible script trying different locations to see if it can execute successfully. This behavior is concerning as it could be part of a larger attack strategy, such as checking for a known malicious file across several directories.\n\nWhile some tasks like image loading and process creation are normal, the combination here—especially the repeated file checks and deletions—raises red flags. It's possible that this activity is part of an attempt to establish persistence or spread components of malware.\n\nGiven these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because it shows signs of potentially malicious behavior despite each individual event not being overtly suspicious on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with command lines checking for specific files, some file deletions, and registry accesses indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what they're telling me.\n\nFirst, the events are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The \"process\" key gives information about the process that was executed or involved, including its name and command line arguments if available. The \"winlog\" key details the specific Windows log event, which can include tasks like process creation, file operations, registry changes, etc. The \"file\" key provides details about any file-related events.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice a lot of events involving \"powershell.exe\". That's immediately interesting because PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but is also commonly abused by attackers for executing malicious scripts and commands. So, I need to see what exactly these PowerShell processes are doing.\n\nThe second event is similar to the first—another PowerShell process without any file information. The third event shows that powershell.exe loaded a specific DLL file: MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. This seems normal because Defender uses various components and scripts for its operations, so this might not be suspicious on its own. However, it's worth keeping an eye out to see if there are any unusual interactions with other files or registry entries.\n\nThe fourth event mentions a file creation by PowerShell in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft\/Windows\/PowerShell. The path seems standard for profile data, so this could be part of normal PowerShell initialization processes. But again, I should check if the content being created is something malicious.\n\nMoving on, there are several events where powershell.exe sets registry values. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often use them to persistence or alter system configurations. Each registry write event (RegistryEvent) by powershell.exe needs scrutiny—what keys and values are being changed? If they're modifying known legitimate areas, it might not be suspicious, but if it's writing to unexpected locations, that could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there are events where conhost.exe is involved in a registry value set. Conhost.exe is the Windows Console Host, often used by PowerShell for its console output. It’s usually not malicious on its own, but seeing it interact with certain registry keys might be worth investigating, especially if paired with other suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the later events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe checks for specific files using Test-Path in the command line. For example: checking for \"C:\\objeto_comum\\estrutura_base\\..\\\" and similar paths. The script is exiting based on whether these files exist or not. This behavior could be part of legitimate scripting to check for required files before executing further actions, but it might also be a way to ensure certain components are present as part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe command lines in these events seem to be testing the existence of various files across different directories. If these files don't exist, the script exits with code 1; otherwise, it continues. The specific paths mentioned (like \"modulo_base_script.bat\") could indicate that the script is looking for other scripts or components to execute. This might be part of a larger script execution process.\n\nI also notice repeated events where powershell.exe loads various .DLL files related to the .NET framework andclr libraries. These are legitimate components, so their loading isn't inherently suspicious unless they're being used in an unusual way or loaded from unexpected locations.\n\nPutting all this together, while there's a lot of normal activity related to PowerShell operations and script execution, the repeated checks for specific files could be concerning. This might indicate that an attacker is ensuring certain conditions are met before executing malicious code. Alternatively, it could just be part of a legitimate script checking its prerequisites.\n\nThe fact that multiple registry entries are being modified by powershell.exe adds some concern. Attackers often use registry modifications to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. However, without knowing the exact keys and values changed, it's hard to say definitively if this is malicious.\n\nThere's also the consistent use of command-line arguments with encoded paths and checks for files across different directories. If these are part of a script that's supposed to run as part of normal operations, it might not be suspicious. But without more context, such as knowing what these scripts are supposed to do, it's hard to rule out malicious intent.\n\nIn summary, while some of the activities appear legitimate (like loading DLLs and checking file existence), others (registry modifications and repeated file checks) could signal potential malicious behavior. The combination of multiple events involving powershell.exe, registry changes, and file existence checks across various directories suggests that this batch might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments checking for specific files and modifying the registry, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The file paths being checked don't look malicious; they’re in standard project directories.\n\nThen there are some file creation and deletion events by PowerShell. It creates a temporary .ps1 file, then deletes it. Temporary files are common for scripts to avoid detection, but without more context, this isn't alarming yet.\n\nThere's also a registry value set and process access events. These can be benign if part of legitimate script execution, like accessing system settings or other processes.\n\nLastly, the whoami.exe execution is straightforward; it’s often used to check user permissions and doesn't indicate malicious activity on its own.\n\nOverall, these activities resemble normal PowerShell scripting behavior without signs of malicious intent.

The fact that it's checking different locations suggests an attempt to locate and execute this potentially harmful script.\n\nAdditionally, there are events showing file creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1) in the user's AppData folder.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events involve PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to hide malicious activities. But I need to look deeper into the specifics of each event.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or created as a process. The second entry shows whoami.exe running, which on its own isn't necessarily suspicious but could be part of some automated task or script checking user permissions.\n\nThen I see several events where powershell.exe is used with specific command lines. Each command seems to be checking the existence of certain files using Test-Path. For example, \"if (Test-Path 'C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\bin\\entrada_base.exe') {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This kind of script is often used by malware to check if specific files are present on the system. If those files aren't there, it might mean that part of their payload isn't installed or they're testing the environment before deploying malicious actions.\n\nAnother thing I'm noticing is the 'Provider Lifecycle' task in the winlog field. Provider lifecycle events can be related to system service changes or driver installations. Malware sometimes uses these events to hide their components, so it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThere are also image load events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, but frequent loading of such modules might be worth investigating if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nI'm also seeing a process accessed event and a registry value set event. Registry modifications can indicate configuration changes, which could be malicious in nature. If the PowerShell script is making changes to the registry, it might be attempting persistence or altering system settings.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running with specific file checks, combined with provider lifecycle and image load events, suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell with these commands isn't typical for standard administrative tasks and seems more aligned with a script trying to establish its presence on the system or checking conditions before executing further actions.\n\nHowever, I'm not seeing any direct indicators like known malicious file hashes or clear signs of data exfiltration in these logs.

Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's common because it's a standard tool, but sometimes attackers use it for malicious activities. The first event shows that a PowerShell script was created and then deleted shortly after. Creating and deleting files quickly can be a sign of trying to hide something, so that catches my attention.\n\nThen there are several events where PowerShell is accessing processes and modifying registry values. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations. Multiple such events might indicate an attacker tweaking settings or installing backdoors.\n\nI also see cmd.exe being used with some IF EXIST checks. That's a bit unusual because it doesn't do much on its own, but if combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger script trying to check for specific files or conditions before executing something else.\n\nThere are multiple instances where whoami.exe is run. This tool typically outputs the current user information, which could be used to gather system details. If this is happening frequently and alongside other scripts, it might be an attempt to enumerate users or privileges.\n\nLooking at the command lines in PowerShell, I notice some patterns like checking if certain files exist (e.g., Test-Path). This behavior suggests that the script is verifying the presence of specific files before proceeding. Such checks are often part of malicious scripts to ensure they have all necessary components before executing harmful code.\n\nThe combination of creating temporary files, deleting them quickly, accessing processes and registry entries, and checking for file existence across multiple events makes me suspicious. These actions don't seem to be part of normal user activity or legitimate script execution. They look more like the steps an attacker might take during lateral movement, data exfiltration, or setting up persistence.\n\nMoreover, the repeated use of PowerShell with similar command-line structures but different paths each time indicates a possible script that's iterating through directories or trying multiple locations to hide its tracks. This kind of behavior is often seen in APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) where attackers try to avoid detection by varying their tactics.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of actions that could be part of an attack chain: initial access, lateral movement, data gathering, or establishing persistence.

Let me try to make sense of them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it has such powerful scripting capabilities. So any unusual PowerShell usage might be worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- The process is powershell.exe accessing something (Process accessed).\n- Then there's a DNS query from chrome.exe, which seems normal unless it's related to malicious domains.\n- whoami.exe is run with no arguments; that's usually harmless but maybe part of some script checking permissions.\n\nBut the more I scroll through, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed. Some have command lines like \"& {ls -recurse...\" which seems like they're trying to list files recursively. That in itself isn't bad, but if it's combined with other suspicious activities...\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is creating temporary files, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. The fact that a script is being created and then deleted shortly after might indicate attempts to bypass certain security policies or test them. Also, the use of multiple ImageLoad events loading various DLLs could be part of malicious code injection.\n\nThere are also several Registry value sets in powershell.exe, which might mean someone is trying to modify system configurations, possibly for persistence mechanisms like creating startup entries or changing other settings that allow continued access after reboot.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation and deletion by winlogbeat.exe, which I'm not immediately suspicious of unless it's part of log tampering. But the main focus here should be on the powershell.exe activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands and file operations could indicate someone attempting to gain access or exfiltrate data.

The processes mentioned are powershell.exe, conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and another instance of powershell.exe again. \n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe is associated with creating a file in the path 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and writing to such a directory might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe second event involves conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost.exe is typically related to console windows, but when it interacts with the registry, especially without clear justification, it could indicate malicious activity like modifying system configurations or creating persistence points.\n\nThird event again has powershell.exe creating a file in 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. The filename seems suspicious—maybe related to Portuguese, given 'estrutura' means structure. It might be dropping a configuration file or something malicious.\n\nThe fourth event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is usually an agent for log management, so this could be legitimate if it's part of the setup. However, seeing .winlogbeat.yml.new suggests it's possibly updating its configuration, which might not be suspicious unless there are other indicators.\n\nThe fifth event again links powershell.exe accessing a process without a file involved. This could be part of command execution or lateral movement within the system.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations and registry changes raise red flags. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, possibly related to persistence, data exfiltration, or installing backdoors. Even though winlogbeat might be legitimate, the overall pattern points towards something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances performing file creation and registry modifications may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
