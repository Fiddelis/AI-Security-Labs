{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries are about powershell.exe being executed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be a vector for malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some of these events, there are specific commands like \"net user\", \"get-localgroupmember -group Users\", and others that interact with system groups and users. These commands can retrieve information about local users and groups, which is something an attacker might do to gather credentials or privileges.\n\nThere's also a mention of \"cmdkey.exe \/list\" which would list saved credentials on the machine. This could be part of credential dumping activities, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks to gain access to system accounts.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary files, specifically \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1\". Creating and then deleting a file quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection, which raises suspicion. Such behavior is often seen in malware or scripts designed to hide their tracks.\n\nAdditionally, several events show the use of different registry accesses and image loading. The registry access could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms, while loading specific DLLs might be part of lateral movement or payload execution.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of these powershell.exe processes with similar command lines suggests a possible script running multiple times, which might be indicative of automated malicious activity. The combination of these events—accessing sensitive information, creating\/deleting temporary files, and using known attack vectors—points towards potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the batch shows signs that could be part of a cyberattack or unauthorized system access. Therefore, it's relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands with potential malicious intent, including user and group enumeration, credential dumping attempts, and temporary file creation\/deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of process creations, especially with net.exe and powershell.exe being used multiple times. Net.exe is often associated with network commands, like user or group management, which could be legitimate but might also indicate malicious activity if combined with other actions. The command lines show things like 'net user' and 'net localgroup', which are common for managing users and groups.\n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe activity, including accessed processes and file creations. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The command line in one event has multiple commands: net user, get-localuser, etc., which seems like it could be gathering information about the system or users, possibly to enumerate permissions.\n\nI also see cmdkey.exe being run with \/list, which typically lists stored credentials. That's a red flag because if an attacker runs this, they can steal credentials, leading to potential lateral movement.\n\nLooking at file operations, there are some file creations by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The paths seem normal for these tools, but the frequency of such events could be suspicious, especially if coupled with other actions like registry changes.\n\nRegistry value sets are happening multiple times across different processes. This is concerning because attackers often modify the registry to persistence their malware or change system configurations. Powershell and conhost.exe making these changes raises eyebrows.\n\nThere's an event where notepad.exe accesses a registry key. While it might seem benign, unusual registry access by standard tools can indicate tampering or information gathering.\n\nsvchost.exe is another process that shows up multiple times accessing the registry. Since svchost is commonly used by legitimate services but also abused by malware, repeated registry changes could be malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of network-related commands, PowerShell scripting with potentially malicious intent, credential dumping via cmdkey.exe, and several registry modifications across various processes. These activities, especially when chained together, suggest possible unauthorized access or lateral movement within a network. It's not just one-offs but repeated patterns that could indicate an attack.\n\nI'm confident enough to say this batch is interesting for investigation because it exhibits behaviors often linked to cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and activities, including net.exe, powershell.exe, cmdkey.exe, and registry modifications. These actions may indicate potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of three log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one.\n\nThe first event is about Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard Windows app and urlmon is part of the system for handling URLs.\n\nNext, whoami.exe running without any unusual command line arguments. It's a common tool used to display user information, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe accessed but no file info. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also widely legitimate. Since there's no specific action or file mentioned here, it might just be someone running it for regular tasks.\n\nPutting them together, none of these events on their own indicate malicious activity. They don't show signs like unusual files, failed logins, or known attack patterns. So I'd classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities without indications of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
