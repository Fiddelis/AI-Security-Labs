{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and figure out if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a whoami.exe being executed. That's usually harmless, just getting user info. Then, powershell.exe is accessedâ€”Powershell can be malicious but on its own isn't suspicious unless it's doing something bad.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so that's normal. Then, another Powershell access and a registry value set. Registry changes can be part of malware persistence or legitimate configuration.\n\nLooking at cmd.exe with command lines involving certutil. Certutil is a utility for certificates but can also be used maliciously to encode\/decode files. The command lines here are using certutil to encode calc.exe into a .txt file and then decode it later. This seems suspicious because encoding executable files can hide malware.\n\nThere are multiple instances of certutil.exe creating, decoding, and executing files. That's a red flag. Also, the filenames like \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" suggest they're trying to hide malicious code.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe calling PcaSvc.dll. Rundll is often used by attackers, but without more context, it's hard to say. Lastly, chrome.exe has network connections and registry changes, which could be normal but might also indicate some activity if part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of certutil for encoding\/decoding files suggests malicious intent, possibly creating malware components. This combination makes the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate suspicious activity involving Powershell and cmd.exe executing commands that encode and decode files using certutil.exe. This pattern suggests potential malicious behavior, such as file obfuscation or malware creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events from chrome.exe. There are network connections detected and multiple registry value sets. I know that Chrome often interacts with the network and system settings, so these could be normal activities. But seeing several registry changes in a row might raise an eyebrow because that's not typical for regular browsing.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating a file named componente_auxiliar.txt. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has scripting capabilities. Creating files can be part of malicious activity, like dropping payloads or setting up persistence mechanisms. This could be suspicious.\n\nAnother event from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. That seems more routine since it's likely part of the log shipping process, but I'm not entirely sure if that's normal behavior for this service.\n\nAlso, powershell.exe accessing processes might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement. This could be an attempt to take control of other processes on the system, which is a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes from Chrome, file creation by PowerShell, and process access by PowerShell. These actions don't clearly point to something malicious, but they do have potential indicators of compromise. The confidence isn't super high because some activities could be legitimate, especially if the system is being used for certain tasks. However, given the combination, it's definitely worth looking into further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including file creation by powershell.exe and repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
