{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is `chrome.exe` and the task is a network connection detection. These might just be normal browsing activities since Chrome often connects to networks. Not too suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, there are several events involving `powershell.exe`. The command line shows commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, and others which can enumerate users and groups. This could indicate someone trying to gather information about the system's users, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe is also loading various DLLs from the Windows directory. While this is common, the specific DLLs mentioned might be part of legitimate operations, but they should still be monitored, especially when combined with other actions.\n\nThere's a file created in the Temp folder named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1`. The fact that it's created and then deleted shortly after raises a red flag. This could be an attempt to test script execution policies or delete evidence of malicious activities.\n\nMultiple events show `Provider Lifecycle` tasks from powershell.exe, which might indicate the script is trying different ways to execute or persist across reboots, which is often seen in persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nLastly, there's a pipe created by powershell.exe. This could be for communication with another process, possibly to hide activities or exfiltrate data.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple network connections from Chrome, but the real focus is on PowerShell activitiesâ€”enumerating users and groups, creating and deleting files in Temp, loading specific DLLs, and using pipes. These behaviors suggest potential malicious activity like privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events show potentially malicious activities including user enumeration, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and possible persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first log shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's probably normal since it's likely the agent itself setting up configuration files.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command with some commands like 'net user' and 'get-localuser'. This might be concerning because such commands can access user information, which could be part of privilege escalation or data gathering by an attacker.\n\nThen I see net.exe being used to get user details. That aligns with the previous point; multiple instances of using net.exe for user enumeration might indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere's a PowerShell process accessed and creating another file, pacote_ativo.txt. Creating files in arbitrary locations, especially via PowerShell, could be suspicious if it's not part of a known process.\n\nA bunch of Chrome registry changes stand out. While Chrome does make registry changes during updates or configurations, multiple such events without context might suggest tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the updater.exe and cmdkey.exe processes, these are legitimate tools but can sometimes be abused. For example, cmdkey is used for managing cached credentials, which if misused, could allow unauthorized access.\n\nThere are several entries with \"Security Group Management\" in the logs without any process information. This might indicate an attempt to modify group policies or access security settings, which is a red flag for potential privilege escalation.\n\nSome repeated events like ImageLoad for combase.dll and urlmon.dll don't seem immediately suspicious on their own but could be part of a larger pattern indicating malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple signs of potentially malicious activities: PowerShell commands accessing user info, file creation by unknown processes, repeated use of net.exe and cmdkey.exe, and security group modifications. These collectively suggest that an attacker might be present or attempting to breach the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including PowerShell commands accessing user information, file creation by unknown processes, and repeated use of net.exe and cmdkey.exe. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the creation of a process named net1.exe with the command line pointing to a localgroup command. That's a bit unusual because net1.exe isn't a common system tool, and using it with 'net localgroup' could be related to group management or privilege escalation. I should keep that in mind.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process creation where a file is being created under the user's AppData directory for PowerShell profiles. That seems normal unless it's part of some malicious activity, but on its own, it's not too suspicious.\n\nThen, conhost.exe is run and sets a registry value. Conhost is typically used for Windows Command Prompt, so unless there's an irregular use here, it might not be concerning. The registry change could just be normal operation.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the user's Downloads folder with a .yml.new extension. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting logs, so this seems legitimate unless it's being used maliciously, which isn't evident here.\n\nAnother PowerShell process creates a file named modulo_base.txt in the Downloads directory. The name doesn't immediately raise red flags, but creating files in Downloads can be part of data exfiltration or just regular user activity.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is run with parameters including '\/ua' and '\/installsource'. That seems like an update check or scheduled task, which is normal unless it's indicating a malicious update deployment. The ImageLoad event for taskschd.dll also looks standard since that's part of Task Scheduler operations.\n\nThere's another svchost.exe process setting a registry value. SvcHost is commonly used by various services, so this isn't unusual unless it's paired with other suspicious activities. \n\nWinlogbeat again creates the same file as before, which could be an ongoing log collection process, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are two more PowerShell events: one where the process is accessed and another where a registry value is set. These might be part of legitimate script execution or could indicate command injection attempts if not properly logged elsewhere.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm noticing multiple instances of Powershell.exe and file creations in user directories, which can often be associated with scripts or tools running as part of normal operations. However, the use of net1.exe with 'net localgroup' stands out a bit because that command could be used to modify user groups, possibly for creating administrative accounts without proper authorization.\n\nThere's also a pattern where certain processes are being created and files are being written multiple times (like winlogbeat and powershell). This repetition might indicate script execution or automated tasks, which is normal, but if these activities are happening outside of scheduled maintenance or known processes, it could warrant closer look. \n\nThe fact that several events involve registry modifications and process creations with potentially sensitive commands makes me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting. However, without more context on the baseline behavior of the system, it's hard to say definitively if these are anomalies. The confidence level is moderate because while there are some red flags, they could also be part of legitimate activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations and file operations that may indicate potential malicious activity, such as the use of net1.exe with 'net localgroup' command.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
