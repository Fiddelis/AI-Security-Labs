The user has provided a series of JSONL logs and wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. They specified that I should consider all events collectively.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to spot any potential red flags or patterns. Most entries are about processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, etc., performing actions such as file creations, registry changes, and process accesses. These alone aren't necessarily suspicious unless they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking closer, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing the registry and files. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated use could be concerning. Additionally, there's a cmd.exe command deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" using SCHTASKS. This caught my attention because deleting a task without a clear reason might indicate an attempt to remove traces or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is the process creation events for schtasks.exe and cmd.exe with specific commands. The use of SCHTASKS to delete a task suggests someone might be trying to cover their tracks by removing scheduled tasks that could be part of their malicious activity. This kind of behavior is often seen in attacks where adversaries try to maintain persistence or clean up after themselves.\n\nConsidering the combination, while individual events aren't alarming, the repeated use of powershell.exe along with the deletion of a specific task points towards potential malicious intent. The confidence level isn't super high because there's no direct evidence of harmful activity, but the patterns are notable enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe performing file and registry operations, including deleting a scheduled task named 'spawn' via cmd.exe.

The events are all in JSONL format, each with process info, winlog tasks, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common for admins but can also be malicious since it's often used by attackers. There are events like Registry value sets, File deletes, Process accesses, and Image loads. The files being accessed include temp scripts and startup profile data, which makes me think maybe something is trying to hide or execute code.\n\nLooking at the other processes: whoami.exe was run a couple times. That's usually harmless but can be part of privilege escalation. Then there's cmd.exe with some commands; sometimes that's used for executing things in a command prompt. Conhost.exe appeared too, which is often associated with running PowerShell or other scripts.\n\nThe combination here makes me suspicious. The repeated use of PowerShell, especially with the \"& {\" in command lines, might indicate it's being called from another script or via command-line arguments that could be obfuscating something. Plus, the file deletion and registry changes are red flags for potential malicious activity trying to cover their tracks.\n\nI'm thinking maybe someone is testing persistence mechanisms or dropping malicious scripts. The multiple ProcessCreate events suggest a lot of new processes starting, which can be part of a chain of command or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nBut wait, could it just be normal admin activity? Maybe they're running PowerShell for legitimate scripting. However, the number and variety of actions—like accessing files and registry keys—seems more than usual. Also, the script path in the temp directory might not be something standard.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple indicators point towards potential malicious behavior, but I'm not 100% certain without more context. The confidence is high enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe activities with suspicious actions such as file deletions, registry modifications, and script execution attempts, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining each event individually to understand what's happening on the system. The events are about processes running and certain log tasks. Let me list them out:\n\n1. conhost.exe setting a registry value.\n2. cmd.exe setting a registry value.\n3. powershell.exe accessing a process.\n4. whoami.exe being created with no arguments.\n5. Another powershell.exe access.\n6. cmd.exe deleting a registry key via command line.\n7. powershell.exe again setting a registry value.\n8. Powershell accessing processes multiple times.\n9. cmd.exe sets another registry value.\n10. reg.exe modifying the registry, which is standard for such tools.\n11. More cmd.exe and powershell activities, including creating temporary files.\n\nLooking at these events, I notice a pattern of multiple process creations and modifications to the Windows Registry. Specifically, there are several instances where PowerShell and cmd.exe are being used to interact with system processes and registry keys. For example, cmd.exe is deleting a specific registry key, which might be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe repeated use of conhost.exe, cmd.exe, and powershell.exe raises suspicion because these tools can be used for various malicious activities. Additionally, the deletion of a registry run key (\"modulo_temporario\") suggests an attempt to remove traces or disable startup programs, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAnother red flag is the creation of temporary PowerShell scripts (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1), which could indicate script execution for malicious purposes. The use of \"powershell.exe & {}\" in command lines might be an attempt to obfuscate commands or execute them without being easily detected.\n\nConsidering the combination of these events, it's concerning because they collectively show unauthorized system changes and process manipulations that don't align with normal user activities. Such behavior is often indicative of malicious intent, like installing backdoors, persistence mechanisms, or conducting reconnaissance on the system.\n\nTherefore, putting all these together, the batch shows signs of potential malicious activity, making it highly relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity, including attempts to delete registry keys and create temporary files which may be indicative of malware.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few events: they're all from `chrome.exe` and involve DNS queries and network connections. That's pretty standard because Chrome is a web browser that makes DNS requests and connects to various servers as part of normal browsing. Nothing unusual there, so those might be considered normal user activity.\n\nNext, I notice some events from `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for system administration but can also be abused by attackers. Looking closer:\n\n- One event shows that powershell.exe accessed the registry and set a value. That's a bit concerning because modifying the Windows Registry can be part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n  \n- Another event catches my attention: it's a Process Create task with a command line argument that includes downloading files from GitHub repositories. The exact command is using `New-Object System.Net.WebClient` to download a file and save it to the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because downloading files directly from such sources can be a sign of malware or script execution.\n\nI'll check if there are multiple instances of similar commands in other events, which I see there are. Each command is slightly different but follows the same pattern of downloading from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. This repetition and the nature of the scripts being downloaded raise red flags about potential malicious activity, possibly a bot or part of a larger script execution chain.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events where new files are created in various locations like `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` and `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`. These temporary files could be part of the scripts being executed, storing data or malicious payloads temporarily before they execute.\n\nLooking at all these together, it's clear that multiple PowerShell processes are downloading and executing code from external sources. This behavior is not typical for a legitimate user activity because users usually don't run such commands manually, especially across different repositories and locations.\n\nMoreover, the combination of registry modifications and file creations in sensitive or temporary directories strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent. Attackers often use these techniques to maintain persistence, drop payloads, or perform other harmful actions on the system.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch as a whole shows signs of potential malicious activity that's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to download files from external repositories and creating temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. Several entries show 'powershell.exe' being executed with command lines that create and delete files in the Temp directory. For example, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1 which is later deleted. This pattern is concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for executing malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there are multiple registry value sets and process accesses involving both PowerShell.exe and Chrome.exe. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or establish persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the presence of conhost.exe and whoami.exe might be part of privilege escalation or information gathering tactics.\n\nNotably, one command line in PowerShell.exe is using Remove-Item to delete a .zip file in the Temp directory, which suggests potential cleanup of dropped files after execution. This behavior aligns with common attack strategies where malicious actors attempt to erase evidence of their activities.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be legitimate, especially within Windows Defender and StartupProfileData contexts, the high volume of PowerShell commands and file manipulations raises red flags. The combination of creating, deleting, and accessing various system components points towards potential malicious activity rather than normal operations.\n\nTherefore, considering all these events collectively, there's a strong indication that this batch is indicative of suspicious or potentially harmful behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, along with registry modifications, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. I'll go through each event step by step and see what patterns emerge.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's pretty normal; whoami is often used to get user information and isn't inherently malicious. But then I notice a few events where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that remove files from the TEMP directory. These are repeated multiple times, each removing different files like tarefa_base.txt, estrutura_ativo.txt, etc.\n\nI know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The fact that it's deleting specific files in the TEMP folder might be suspicious, especially if these files aren't supposed to exist or if they're being deleted without a clear reason. Malware often cleans up after itself by removing traces of its activities.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where PowerShell accesses registry values and loads various DLLs. While this is common for script execution, the combination with file deletions could indicate an attempt to cover tracks. Additionally, there's a process called winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be part of log management but doesn't directly relate to the suspicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of \"&\" in the command lines, which allows for multiple commands to be executed in PowerShell. This can be used to chain malicious actions together, making it harder to detect each individual component as suspicious on its own.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of file deletions using PowerShell, which could be part of an attack. While some events might look normal individually, the repetition and combination suggest potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are deleting files from the TEMP directory using command-line arguments that appear to be attempting to remove various text files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they're all from powershell.exe with tasks related to image loading. That seems normal because PowerShell often loads various DLLs when running scripts. The file paths mentioned are within standard Windows directories, so that doesn't raise any red flags immediately.\n\nNext, I see an event where a file is created in the user's Temp directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. PowerShell scripts being created here could be part of normal script execution or policy testing, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where files in the Temp directory are deleted using Remove-Item with ErrorAction Ignore. This means any errors during deletion won't be shown, which can sometimes be a tactic to avoid detection. The specific files being deleted seem to be .zip files, which might have been extracted earlier. The use of multiple similar commands could indicate automated cleanup or an attempt to remove traces.\n\nI notice several events where the command line is executing Remove-Item on different .zip files in the Temp directory. This repetition suggests a script that's looping through and deleting these files. It could be part of legitimate cleanup, but it might also be covering tracks after extracting malicious content.\n\nThere are also some events from chrome.exe accessing registry values and loading MpOAV.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. That seems normal for browser processes, so probably not an issue.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll, another Defender-related file. Again, this could be legitimate.\n\nA process named conhost.exe also accessed the registry, which is unusual because it's typically a low-privilege process. I should look into what conhost.exe does in this context.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple deletions of files from the Temp directory via PowerShell scripts with specific naming conventions and repeated commands. The use of ErrorAction Ignore could be trying to suppress any errors, possibly hiding failed attempts which might indicate an issue.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show a lot of activity in the Temp folder using PowerShell. While some of this could be normal script execution or cleanup, the combination of creating a test script, deleting multiple specific files with similar names, and the use of ErrorAction Ignore suggests potential malicious behavior aiming to remove evidence. This raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions are malicious, but the pattern is concerning enough that it warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show file creation and deletion in the Temp directory with ErrorAction Ignore, suggesting potential evidence sanitization.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

The goal is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation or not, and provide a single classification with justification and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each event. Each line is a JSON object containing three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n1. PowerShell.exe loading MpClient.dll from a Windows Defender directory. This seems normal as Defender might use these DLLs for operations.\n2. PowerShell creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's a standard location for PowerShell profiles; not suspicious on its own.\n3. Registry value set by PowerShell. Again, common activity since scripts often interact with the registry.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where conhost.exe and whoami.exe are created. Whoami is a legitimate system tool used to display user information, so that's normal unless it's being misused. The command line seems straightforward, just executing whoami without any unusual arguments.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity from chrome.exe modifying registry values. Browsers often interact with the registry for settings and extensions, so this doesn't raise red flags immediately.\n\nI notice several events where PowerShell is accessing processes or files. For example:\n- Accessing MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender.\n- Creating a file in Downloads named 'objeto_padrao.txt'. The filename looks benign, but I should check if it's related to any known malicious activities. It doesn't ring a bell immediately, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nThe repeated registry writes by Chrome and other processes are typical. No signs of unusual persistence mechanisms here.\n\nThere's a pattern where PowerShell is accessing various system files or creating new ones, which could be part of legitimate script execution but might also indicate malicious activity if combined with other behaviors. However, without more context on the user's actions or known attack patterns, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple instances of process creation and file writes by PowerShell and Chrome, along with registry modifications—are these activities a baseline for normal system behavior? If this happened over a short period, especially if it's unusual for the system, it might be worth investigating. But without knowing the baseline activity levels, it's hard to assess.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because each individual event seems routine, and there's no clear indication of malicious intent when looking at them collectively. However, I have a 75% confidence because while each action isn't suspicious on its own, the frequency or combination could warrant closer inspection if it deviates from normal patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of routine system activities such as process creation, file operations, and registry modifications by common executables like PowerShell.exe and Chrome.exe.

Let me look through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events showing the creation of 'whoami.exe' processes. That seems normal because whoami is a common system utility used to get user information. But I wonder why it's being created so many times. Maybe someone is running it repeatedly for some reason.\n\nNext, there are several entries where powershell.exe is accessed or creating files. Powershell is powerful and often used by admins, but it can also be a vector for attacks if used inappropriately. The first time I see 'Process accessed' for powershell, that's just the process starting. But then later, it's creating files like '.winlogbeat.yml.new' and 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The latter filename looks suspicious—maybe it's Portuguese for \"active package\"? Not sure what that refers to.\n\nLooking at the file paths: The winlogbeat.exe created a data file in its own directory. That seems normal if it's part of their setup or logging process. But then powershell creating 'pacote_ativo.txt' is interesting because I don't know why that specific filename would be generated by the system unless someone is executing commands to create files with custom names.\n\nPutting this together, having multiple processes and file creations might indicate some automated script running, but the use of powershell could be a red flag. Maybe it's part of legitimate admin tasks, but without more context, there's potential for malicious activity like persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these events are normal or not, but the combination makes me think they might warrant further investigation.
