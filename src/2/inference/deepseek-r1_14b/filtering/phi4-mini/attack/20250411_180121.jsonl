I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first five entries are all from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That's normal because Chrome does make a lot of network requests. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, I see some powershell.exe processes. The command lines look suspicious because they're using DownloadFile from raw.githubusercontent.com URLs. This is a red flag because downloading files from such sites could be malicious. Also, the file paths in the TEMP directory might indicate that these are scripts being downloaded and executed, which is common in attacks.\n\nThere's an event where a script file is created and then immediately deleted. That seems odd because attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting logs or temporary files to avoid detection. The repeated Provider Lifecycle tasks with similar command lines suggest automated activity, possibly part of a botnet or malware distribution.\n\nConsidering all these together—suspicious PowerShell commands, file downloads from untrusted sources, and file creation\/deletion patterns—it's highly indicative of malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're worth investigating for potential cybersecurity issues.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines show it downloading files from various GitHub repositories. That's a red flag because downloading files, especially from untrusted sources or in an unusual manner, could indicate malicious behavior. These downloads are happening to different paths in the TEMP directory, which is another point of concern since TEMP locations are often used by malware.\n\nLooking further, there are several Registry value sets and File created events related to powershell.exe. While some activities are normal for scripts, the combination with downloading files from GitHub suggests potential suspicious activity. It's possible that these downloads are part of a script attempting to establish persistence or download malicious payloads.\n\nThere are also multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. Although Chrome does perform such operations during its operation, repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be worth looking into, especially if they seem out of the ordinary for the user's typical activity. However, on their own, these might not be as concerning unless there's a pattern indicating abuse.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe and other system processes like MpDefenderCoreService.exe and winlogbeat.exe. These are usually legitimate, but any unusual activities or multiple events from them could indicate something's off. For example, Network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService might be part of normal operations, but it's worth checking if this is expected behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries like RuntimeBroker.exe and calc.exe accessing resources. These processes can sometimes be exploited by malware, so their activities should be monitored.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated powershell.exe downloads from GitHub are particularly concerning. This could indicate script execution or downloading of malicious scripts. The combination with file creation and registry modifications suggests potential attempts to establish persistence or perform other malicious tasks on the system.\n\nI'm also noting that some files being downloaded have .txt extensions, which might seem benign, but in the context of powershell commands and multiple such events, it raises suspicion that these could be part of a larger script or payload delivery mechanism.\n\nIn conclusion, while some individual events might not be alarming, the pattern of multiple powershell.exe downloads, file creations, and registry modifications across different files and paths is significant. This batch shows behavior that could indicate malicious activity, making it worthy of further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories to temporary locations may indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I have a batch of system log events in JSONL format that need analysis. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, I'll start by noting down the processes and their associated tasks. There are multiple instances of 'svchost.exe' performing registry value sets. SvChost.exe is a common system process, but frequent writes to the registry might be suspicious, especially if they're happening so often. Then there's 'powershell.exe' being accessed several times. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated accesses could indicate something fishy.\n\nThere are also instances where 'whoami.exe' is run without any command-line arguments. Whoami is usually benign, but if it's executed in a loop or with other processes, it might be part of an attempt to gather information about the system. Then there's 'cmd.exe' being used with specific commands like deleting scheduled tasks and registry entries. The use of cmd with parameters that delete entries could be trying to remove traces of prior activities, which is often a sign of malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are events involving 'schtasks.exe' creating or deleting tasks, and 'reg.exe' modifying the registry. Scheduled tasks being deleted might indicate an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt system operations. The deletion of specific registry entries under \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" suggests that something is trying to remove entries related to startup programs, which could be malicious as it's a common technique for persistence.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple processes accessing and modifying the registry, deleting scheduled tasks, and using command-line tools like cmd and powershell in sequence raises red flags. These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior and might indicate a coordinated attack or malicious script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process activity, including registry modifications, deletions of scheduled tasks, and command-line tool usage indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. All the events are in JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing an event. My goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events involve processes related to 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers for malicious activities. So the fact that there are multiple instances of it running catches my attention.\n\nLooking at the details:\n\n1. There are several entries where 'powershell.exe' is accessing or creating processes, which could be normal administrative tasks, but I need to check the context.\n2. The events include tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, and File operations (create, delete). These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious, but their combination might raise flags.\n3. One event shows a file being created in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1'. The naming looks suspiciously temporary or test-like, which could indicate script execution or testing of permissions.\n4. Another event deletes that same file shortly after it was created, which is interesting because attackers might clean up traces of their activities.\n5. There are multiple events showing Registry value sets and Image loads from various .dll files. This can be part of legitimate operations, but it's also a common technique in malware to manipulate the system registry or load malicious libraries.\n6. Towards the end, there's an event involving 'whoami.exe', which is often used to get user information. In the context of other suspicious activities, this could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nI'm concerned about the repeated use of PowerShell and the combination of process creations, file operations, registry modifications, and external commands (like '& {}' in command lines). These behaviors can be indicative of script execution, lateral movement, or persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nHowever, without more context, such as timestamps showing rapid succession or other anomalies, it's hard to definitively say these are malicious. But given the number of suspicious activities clustered around PowerShell and file operations, there's a high probability that this batch is relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious file operations (create, delete) and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at the individual events.\n\nI see multiple entries where processes like cmd.exe and conhost.exe are accessing registry values. That's a common activity for legitimate software, especially during setup or configuration tasks. However, it might also be something malicious trying to hide its presence.\n\nLooking further, there's extensive use of powershell.exe with various command lines. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The command lines like \"& {}\" are a bit generic but could indicate script execution or obfuscation attempts.\n\nSeveral events show ImageLoad tasks related to .NET framework components. This is normal for PowerShell since it relies on these libraries, but sometimes attackers might load malicious modules which would also trigger this event.\n\nFile creation and deletion in the Temp directory by powershell.exe caught my attention. Creating a script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest... could be part of legitimate testing or policy enforcement, but it's suspicious because scripts are often used for malicious activities.\n\nThere are Pipe Created events from both PowerShell and chrome.exe. While legitimate applications use pipes for communication, attackers might also create pipes to facilitate inter-process communication, which can be a sign of command-and-control activity.\n\nOther notable points include Registry value sets by ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe, which seem out of place for these standard system processes. This could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially obfuscated commands, file operations in Temp, and unusual registry modifications across multiple processes make this batch concerning. While some activities are common, the combination suggests possible malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with potentially obfuscated command lines, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, and registry modifications suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm given a series of log entries from a JSONL file, and I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for an investigation.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to Chrome.exe making registry changes. There are seven such entries. While Chrome does sometimes make changes to the registry when updating settings or extensions, doing this multiple times in quick succession might be worth noting. But alone, these aren't necessarily suspicious unless they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's an event involving powershell.exe with a command line that includes removing files from the TEMP directory. The command is: Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\tarefa_base.zip -ErrorAction Ignore. This caught my attention because PowerShell is often used in scripting and can be associated with malicious activities, but it's also commonly used for legitimate tasks.\n\nFollowing this, there are several other powershell.exe events including creating files, accessing processes, and loading images. There's a file created in the Temp folder named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1, which is then deleted shortly after. This seems like it could be part of script execution or testing. The deletion might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nAnother event involves conhost.exe making registry changes. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process used for console windows, but any unusual activity here should be monitored as attackers sometimes use legitimate tools in their toolkit.\n\nAdditionally, there's a whoami.exe being executed with the command line pointing to its own path. Whoami is typically used to display user information, and while it's straightforward, executing it without clear context could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used to execute commands, create temporary files, and delete them. This behavior can be a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for executing malicious scripts due to its extensive capabilities and prevalence in legitimate use cases, making it harder to detect. The repeated file operations and deletions could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or download malicious payloads.\n\nThe combination of registry modifications by both Chrome.exe and other processes, coupled with the powershell.exe activities, raises concerns about potential lateral movement, data exfiltration, or installation of persistent malware. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, their frequency and sequence over a short period suggest a possible coordinated attack.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs is classified as interesting because it exhibits behaviors that are commonly associated with malicious activities, such as using PowerShell for command execution and file manipulation, which could indicate an ongoing or potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands, creating temporary files, and deleting them, along with registry modifications and a whoami.exe execution, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, a lot of the events are PowerShell executions removing files from the TEMP directory. They're using commands like Remove-Item with different zip files. I remember that attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for their activities because it’s common and can fly under the radar. Plus, deleting files in the temp folder isn't uncommon, but the fact that there are multiple such events with different filenames might be a red flag. Maybe they're trying to clean up traces of something else.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe is involved. It shows registry value sets and loading system32 files like amsi.dll, which is related to antivirus scanning. That seems normal because Chrome would interact with the system's security features. But I should check if these actions are typical for Chrome or if they're being used abnormally.\n\nLooking further, there are entries where powershell.exe creates processes and accesses registry values. The fact that PowerShell is creating startup profiles could be part of legitimate administration, but it might also indicate persistence mechanisms if done by malicious actors. Additionally, the use of 'whoami.exe' is another clue—this tool is often used to check user permissions, which attackers might do to escalate privileges or gather information.\n\nI notice some events where the command lines are obfuscated or have different filenames each time. This variability might be an attempt to avoid detection by varying filenames so security systems don't catch on easily. The multiple calls to remove specific files in the temp directory could be part of a cleanup routine after deploying malicious software, trying to erase evidence.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events like Chrome and whoami.exe are normal, the repeated PowerShell activity with file deletions, especially targeting the TEMP folder, raises concerns. The varied filenames suggest they're not just cleaning up temporary files but possibly removing malicious payloads or logs. The combination of registry modifications, process creations, and file deletions using PowerShell is a common tactic in cyberattacks for both persistence and data exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the pattern of multiple PowerShell executions with varying file removals and system interactions doesn't align with typical user behavior. It might indicate an active threat actor trying to maintain presence or erase their tracks on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions removing files from the TEMP directory, combined with other system activity such as registry modifications and process creations, suggest potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe loading various DLLs. This is common because PowerShell often uses these components. But the fact that it's loading specific ones might be worth noting.\n\nNext, I see file creation and deletion in temporary directories. The files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 are created and then deleted quickly. That could indicate script testing or perhaps an attempt to execute code without leaving traces.\n\nThere are command lines showing removal of temp files, which might be normal if it's part of a cleanup process, but it's also a red flag for malicious activity trying to erase evidence.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems benign, as it's likely part of the log shipping process. But I'm keeping an eye on any unusual paths or permissions.\n\nRegistry accesses and changes by both PowerShell and Chrome are present. While some registry activity is normal, especially from scripts, multiple writes without clear purpose could hint at persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution seems out of place compared to the rest. It's a common tool for info gathering, which might be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows PowerShell executing commands that delete temp files, creating and deleting script-related files quickly, and accessing the registry. These activities can be indicators of malicious behavior, such as script testing, file deletion to cover tracks, or persistence setup. The repeated actions and varied tasks make me lean towards this being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell executing commands that delete temporary files, creating and deleting script-related files quickly, accessing registry values, and other file operations could indicate potential malicious activity or suspicious behavior.

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is a registry value set. This might seem suspicious at first glance because modifying the registry can be part of malicious activity. However, Chrome sometimes does legitimate updates or modifications to system settings, so these alone might not be concerning unless they're happening outside normal usage hours or in an unusual pattern.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but also commonly exploited by attackers for executing commands and scripts. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could raise flags. However, without seeing the actual command-line arguments or evidence of malicious script execution, it's hard to classify this as suspicious.\n\nI notice some Process Create events for whoami.exe. Whoami is a standard system utility used to display user information. While its legitimate use is common, repeated creation might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system, which could be part of reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nThere are also FileCreate events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is likely part of log management software, so creating files in that context is normal. The other file created by powershell.exe named pacote_ativo.txt isn't inherently suspicious; however, without knowing its contents or how it's being used, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows a variety of common processes and activities. While some actions could be red flags, there's no clear indication of malicious intent. The high volume of similar events might suggest testing or legitimate system administration rather than coordinated attacks. Therefore, without more context or evidence of unusual behavior in these logs, I wouldn't classify this as particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of common processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe performing legitimate tasks such as registry modifications and file creations.
