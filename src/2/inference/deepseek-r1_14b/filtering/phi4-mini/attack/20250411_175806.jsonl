{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for system administration but can also be a tool for attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. I notice that some of these events show 'Process accessed' and others don't have any file associated, which could mean they're just checking something or maybe trying to hide their tracks.\n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being executed. That's usually used to get user information, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious. It might be part of legitimate system checks.\n\nThen, cmd.exe is used with a command line argument that includes REG ADD. This is adding a value to the Windows Registry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That specific registry key runs programs at startup, so an attacker might use this to persist their malicious software upon login. The path points to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\", which sounds suspicious because it's a .exe file in a directory that's not typically used for system files.\n\nThere are also events with reg.exe and conhost.exe modifying the registry, adding more entries under HKCU\\Run. This pattern of multiple registry modifications is concerning because attackers often use such methods to maintain persistence across reboots.\n\nLooking at winlogbeat.exe, it's creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool used for collecting Windows logs, so this seems legitimate unless there's something unusual about how it's being used here. The creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new might be part of its configuration process, but I'm not sure if that's normal or could indicate tampering.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with registry accesses and modifications, combined with cmd.exe and reg.exe adding entries to the Run key, suggests potential malicious activity. These actions are common in persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure they're executed on each user login. The multiple events with similar patterns reinforce the suspicion rather than being isolated incidents.\n\nI'm confident that this batch is indicative of suspicious behavior, likely related to persistence setup or lateral movement within a compromised system. Therefore, it's definitely interesting from an investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing and modifying the registry, along with cmd.exe and reg.exe adding entries to HKCU\\\\Run, indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
