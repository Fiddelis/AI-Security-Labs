{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are several entries here from different processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe. I notice that many of these processes are accessing the Windows Registry—specifically, there are multiple instances where registry values are being set. This stands out because attackers often use legitimate tools to modify system configurations as part of their tactics.\n\nFor example, cmd.exe is used in a command line to add entries under HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run. These kinds of Registry modifications are common for persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious actors to run arbitrary code on each user logon. The use of REG ADD commands further supports this behavior, which is often seen in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there's a PowerShell.exe process that created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt and also accessed the registry. Powershell is frequently exploited for its powerful scripting capabilities, making it a red flag when unusual scripts or commands are executed.\n\nI should also consider the variety of processes involved—powershell, cmd, reg.exe—all being used to interact with system settings. This diversification might be an attempt to evade detection by using multiple tools and activities that aren't individually suspicious but together could indicate malicious intent.\n\nThe justification for classifying this as INTERESTING is the combination of registry modifications, use of command-line tools like cmd and powershell in a way that suggests persistence or backdoor creation. The confidence level is high because these behaviors align with known tactics used by attackers.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of registry modifications, use of command-line tools like cmd.exe and reg.exe to add entries for persistence, and powershell.exe activity which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
