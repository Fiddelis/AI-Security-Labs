First, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's notable because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. The command lines in some events show attempts to search for sensitive terms like \"pass\" across various file types. This could indicate password harvesting or data exfiltration.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where Registry values are being set by different processes, including svchost.exe and Calculator.exe. These actions can be indicators of malicious activity since attackers might try to maintain persistence through registry changes.\n\nThere's also a script using findstr.exe looking for specific strings in files, which could be part of data collection or exfiltration attempts. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks are red flags as they don't align with normal user activities and might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nWhile some events seem benign, like the Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, the overall pattern—especially the combination of PowerShell usage and file\/directory searches—raises concerns about potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events in JSONL format to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The user wants only one classification and justification based on all the events together.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. The first event is `whoami.exe` being executed. That's usually benign, but it depends on the context. It can be used by attackers to check permissions.\n2. Then there are multiple events involving `powershell.exe`. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The command lines look suspicious with search patterns for \"pass\" in various file types like *.xml, *.doc, etc. This could indicate an attempt to find sensitive information, which might be malicious.\n3. There are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading DLLs. That's normal, but combined with the other activities, it raises flags.\n4. A file was created and then deleted in the Temp directory with a script name containing \"PSScriptPolicyTest\". Creating and deleting temporary files is common for hiding traces of malicious activity.\n5. Multiple Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe might indicate some form of persistence or communication being set up.\n6. Lastly, an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file seems unrelated to the other suspicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell with specific command lines aimed at searching for \"pass\" in sensitive files and the creation\/deletion of temporary scripts suggest potential malicious behavior. These are red flags that could indicate data exfiltration or credential harvesting, which is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including attempts to search for sensitive information and the creation\/deletion of temporary files, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's look at each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is often used by legitimate processes, but sometimes it can be involved in malicious activities, especially when it comes to the Windows console. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext up is whoami.exe being run from the system32 directory. Whoami is a standard tool for getting user information, so seeing it here isn't unusual unless there's something else indicating abuse.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and setting registry values. Powershell is powerful but can be used for both good and bad. The repeated use might be a red flag if it's doing too many actions quickly or accessing sensitive areas, but I need to see the pattern.\n\nLooking at WMIC.exe events: one creates a process to delete notepad.exe, another loads DLLs from Windows Defender and system32 paths. Deleting processes can be legitimate admin work, but also potentially malicious activity. The command line deleting notepad.exe is interesting—it could be an attempt to remove traces or disrupt normal operations.\n\nThere are several cmd.exe instances with commands like net user \/del, which deletes a user account. This kind of administrative action is something attackers might do to remove accounts they created or to escalate privileges. Also, the fact that it's using different command-line arguments (like net1.exe) suggests someone trying various methods to execute commands.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple process creations and deletions, registry modifications, and user deletions—these are indicators of potential malicious activity. The use of several tools like powershell, cmd, wmic, and net in quick succession could be part of an attack chain. It's possible that an attacker is trying to delete accounts or modify system configurations to maintain access or cover their tracks.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because the combination of process deletions, user account removals, and multiple tool usages suggests a coordinated effort that might not be standard admin work.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially malicious activities including deletion of user accounts and processes using various tools like cmd.exe, net.exe, and WMIC.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to Chrome.exe. There are multiple entries where Chrome is detected for network connections and registry changes. Since Chrome is a common application, these might just be normal activities unless there's something unusual about them. But looking at the timestamps or any other anomalies isn't provided here, so it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are several events from powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has legitimate purposes but can also execute malicious commands. The creation of files like 'objeto_logico.txt' and others might be part of a script or legitimate activity, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious.\n\nI see cmd.exe being used with command lines that involve deleting scheduled tasks. Specifically, the command lines show schtasks \/delete commands targeting specific task names. This could indicate someone trying to remove scheduled tasks, which might be an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity or part of legitimate system administration. However, repeated deletions without a clear reason could raise flags.\n\nThere are also events where schtasks.exe is used to create processes and load image files. Scheduled tasks can be a vector for persistence, so creating or deleting them without a good reason might be concerning. The use of specific task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" seems arbitrary, which could be a red flag if these tasks are not known to the system's admins.\n\nAnother point is the use of svchost.exe interacting with the registry. Svchost is typically used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware. Registry changes here might be normal updates or they could be part of malicious activity trying to hide traces.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the combination raises some concerns. The repeated use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe for deleting tasks, along with PowerShell's file creations and process accesses, could indicate potential malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration attempts. However, without more context about the environment and standard operating procedures, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because of the potential misuse of legitimate tools and multiple events that together might suggest a pattern worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of file creation, process access, and registry modifications involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving different processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, and sc.exe. These are often legitimate tools but can also be used for malicious activities. The tasks associated with these processes include creating new instances, accessing files, and modifying registry values.\n\nLooking closer, several commands in the command lines stand out. For example:\n- \"cmd.exe \/c net user \\\"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\\\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\"\n- \"sc delete win32times\"\n\nThese look like they're trying to delete users or services. Specifically, \"\/del \/domain\" indicates an attempt to remove a user account across the domain, which could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement in a network.\n\nThe use of redirection (\">nul 2>&1\") suggests that the command is running quietly, hiding output, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection. Additionally, repeated calls to powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various commands might indicate scripting or automated processes trying to perform multiple actions quickly.\n\nThere are also registry modifications detected through events like \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added or deleted.\" These could be part of installing or removing malware components, which often require registry changes for persistence.\n\nThe combination of deleting user accounts, services, and modifying the registry suggests potential unauthorized access. It's possible that an attacker is attempting to clean up traces after compromising a system or trying to establish persistence by altering system configurations.\n\nGiven these points, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. The repeated use of legitimate tools for illegitimate purposes, coupled with attempts to modify system settings and delete accounts, raises red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations and registry modifications involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, and sc.exe suggest potential malicious activities such as user deletion attempts and service removals.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's look at each event one by one.\n\nThe first event involves ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That sounds normal because Windows apps often interact with the registry. But sometimes malicious software can do that too, but on its own, it might just be regular activity.\n\nNext up is powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used for both good and bad purposes. There are a lot of legitimate reasons why Powershell would access things, like scripting or system administration tasks. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe involving DNS queries and network connections. Chrome does a lot of DNS lookups when navigating websites and establishes connections as part of normal browsing. The repeated DNS queries could be due to multiple tabs or extensions. Similarly, the network connections might just be regular HTTP\/HTTPS traffic for web pages.\n\nI should consider if any of these events together indicate something suspicious. ApplicationFrameHost is known for legitimate use, Powershell access without specific indicators isn't enough, and Chrome's activities are baseline for a browser. Since there's no indication of failed attempts, unusual times, or multiple failed logins, it seems like everything here is within normal operation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the batch doesn't show any signs of malicious behavior. All these events are typical for everyday computer usage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal user activities such as registry modifications by legitimate processes (ApplicationFrameHost.exe), PowerShell access, and Chrome's DNS queries and network connections which are part of standard web browsing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, each line a separate JSON object. There are multiple entries here, all from various processes on a Windows system.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe is involved with an ImageLoad task, loading MpClient.dll. That's normal because PowerShell often loads DLLs for functionality. The next few events also involve powershell.exe with tasks like Registry value sets and Process accesses. These activities could be suspicious if they're out of the ordinary, but alone, they don't necessarily raise a red flag.\n\nThere are several instances where whoami.exe is being run from system32. Whoami is a standard tool for getting user information; it's usually not malicious unless used inappropriately. The command lines look normal here. There's also conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as legitimate processes for handling console services and log shipping respectively.\n\nI notice multiple RegistryEvent tasks across different processes like RuntimeBroker, notepad, svchost, and others. Registry activity is common in Windows, so these might just be regular operations unless they're accessing unusual keys or happening at an unusual frequency.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe are a bit concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and persistence. But without seeing actual commands or evidence of malicious script execution, it's hard to say. The fact that there are multiple instances might indicate some automated tasking, but not necessarily malicious intent.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat creates a file in the data directory with .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems like part of log shipping setup and isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are several points that could be monitored—like frequent PowerShell activity or Registry modifications—they don't collectively indicate malicious behavior. The events seem to cover standard operations across various legitimate processes. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear sign of an attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activities such as process creation and registry modifications, which are common in a typical Windows environment. There is no indication of malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a cmd.exe process deleting some temp files. That seems normal because cleanup operations are common, but the specific file names like \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\" catch my eye. They sound like they might be related to malicious activities, maybe part of a payload or dropped files.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script running. The repeated access without obvious legitimate activity could be suspicious. There are also events where powershell.exe creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because attackers might create temporary files to execute malicious code, which they delete afterward to cover their tracks.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where processes like cmd.exe and conhost.exe modify the registry. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs on each system startup. The fact that these changes happen multiple times from different processes adds to the concern.\n\nWhoami.exe is run, which usually just reports user information. However, if this is part of a larger sequence of events, it could indicate reconnaissance to gather system info. It's not inherently malicious but combined with other actions might be significant.\n\nThere are also multiple entries where powershell.exe loads various DLLs and modules. This can be normal for scripts, but the specific modules loaded or how they're being used could be a sign of malicious activity. Additionally, the repeated creation and deletion of the same file in Temp suggests some form of scripting loop or an attempt to hide evidence.\n\nPutting it all together, I notice a pattern: cmd.exe deleting files, PowerShell accessing and modifying system components, multiple registry changes, and temporary file manipulations. These activities don't seem to be part of normal user behavior. They could indicate someone trying to execute malicious scripts, possibly using legitimate tools in an unauthorized way. The use of both cmd and powershell suggests a possible script execution that's attempting to stay under the radar by combining different command-line tools.\n\nThe frequency of these events also stands out. While occasional process creation or file access is normal, the sheer number and sequence make me think there's a coordinated effort, possibly from an attacker trying to execute multiple steps in a malicious process. The deletion of temporary files could be attempts to remove traces after running some payload.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like this batch of events could indeed be indicative of malicious behavior or at least suspicious activity that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation, file deletions, registry modifications, and PowerShell activities indicate potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of cmd.exe for deleting files and powershell.exe with suspicious commands suggests possible scripting or payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
