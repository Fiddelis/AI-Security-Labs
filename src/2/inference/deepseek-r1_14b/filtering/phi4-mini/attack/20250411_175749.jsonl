{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, let's break down each event:\n\n1. The first event is a Process Create task by svchost.exe. SvcHost is a common Windows process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. However, in this case, it's running with parameters like -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted and other flags which seem standard for services.\n\n2. Next, multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe. Chrome often writes to the registry when updating settings or extensions, so these could just be normal user activity unless they're writing to unexpected areas.\n\n3. There's a Logon event by services.exe, which is part of Windows services and likely legitimate for system startup or service management.\n\n4. A Special Logon event with no process info. This might be related to system processes or services starting up without a GUI session.\n\n5. A File created event from powershell.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. PowerShell can be malicious, but it's also commonly used for legitimate tasks. The filename modulo_temporario.txt seems generic and could be part of script execution.\n\n6-12: Several more Registry set events from chrome.exe again. This repetition might indicate some automation or extension activity, which is common but not necessarily suspicious unless there are anomalies in the registry keys being modified.\n\n13: Another File created event by winlogbeat.exe (likely a log management tool) creating a .yml file in its own directory. This seems benign as it's part of data collection processes.\n\nConsidering all these events together, none stand out as overtly malicious. The repetition of chrome registry writes might be worth monitoring but isn't conclusive for an immediate investigation. Without evidence of failed logons, access to restricted areas, or known malicious file hashes, there's no clear indication of compromise.\n\nTherefore, while some elements could warrant closer monitoring, the batch as a whole doesn't present enough indicators to classify it as interesting for further investigation at this time.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creations, registry modifications, and file operations without any signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". Each of these logs doesn't have any process or file information associated with them. I'm wondering if this is normal or suspicious. Execute remote commands could be part of legitimate operations, like system administration tasks, but they can also be a sign of malicious activity, especially if there's no context about what command was executed.\n\nNext, there's an event where the task is \"Process Create\" for WmiPrvSE.exe with the command line pointing to wbem\/wmiprvse.exe. I know that WMI is often used by malware for persistence and communication, so this could be a red flag. However, it's also a legitimate system process, so without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are multiple file-related events, like \"File created\" by winlogbeat.exe. That seems normal if it's part of the logging setup or configuration. But I should check if the path where the file is created is expected or if it's in an unusual location.\n\nLooking at the registry value sets by various processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe, these are common system applications. Malware sometimes uses these legitimate processes to hide malicious activities, so multiple writes to the registry might warrant closer look. But again, without knowing what data is being written, it's tricky.\n\nThere are also several \"Registry value set\" events from chrome.exe. Browsers do write to the registry for settings and extensions, but repeated writes could indicate something else, like a script or extension doing more than usual.\n\nLastly, there's a \"Pipe Created\" event from chrome.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but in some cases, they might be exploited by malware for lateral movement within the system.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm noticing that most of these events are either normal background activities or could potentially be malicious actions. The repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no additional info is concerning. The creation of files and registry changes from various processes, especially WmiPrvSE.exe, which is known for being abused by attackers, adds to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, without knowing the baseline behavior of these systems or the exact commands executed in those remote tasks, it's hard to be certain. Still, the combination of multiple suspicious events makes this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events and suspicious process activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are several events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's interesting because executing remote commands can be a sign of potential malicious activity, like command-line attacks or remote code execution. But without more context, it's hard to say if these are normal or suspicious.\n\nThen, I notice an event where PowerShell.exe accessed something. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and by attackers for lateral movement and executing commands. The fact that it was accessed could be a red flag.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event for whoami.exe. Whoami is often used to gather system information, which in itself isn't malicious, but when combined with other activities, it might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nNext, I see cmd.exe being executed with specific command-line arguments. The command line seems to set up a scheduled task using SCHTASKS. Creating scheduled tasks can be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers to maintain access over time. This is definitely something that stands out as suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's another Process Create event for schtasks.exe, which is the actual tool used to create and manage scheduled tasks. The command line in this case is setting up a task named \"spawn\" to run cmd.exe at a specific time (20:10). This behavior is concerning because it indicates an attempt to schedule a task that might execute malicious code later.\n\nI also see multiple Registry value sets from various processes like PowerShell, cmd.exe, svchost.exe, and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence strategies or changing system configurations, which is another red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there's a File Create event for svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks folder named \"spawn\". This could be related to the scheduled task setup, further indicating that an attacker is trying to establish persistence.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I'm noticing a pattern of activities that are indicative of potential malicious behavior. The repeated remote command executions, the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe with specific commands, setting up scheduled tasks, and registry modifications all point towards possible attack vectors like lateral movement, persistence, or privilege escalation.\n\nWhile some individual events might not be suspicious on their own (like using whoami.exe or accessing powershell.exe), the combination of these activities in a short time frame raises concern. The multiple Registry changes and file creations are especially worrying because they can indicate an attacker attempting to leave backdoors or alter system configurations for persistence.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors together, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence that it's relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity including remote command execution, PowerShell access, scheduled task creation, and registry modifications, suggesting possible persistence or attack vectors.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
