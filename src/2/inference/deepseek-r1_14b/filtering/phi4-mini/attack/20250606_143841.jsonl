Let me start by looking at each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few lines show powershell.exe being accessed multiple times with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. Then there are whoami.exe creations, which is a standard command-line tool for identifying user information. Not immediately suspicious, but I should keep an eye out.\n\nLooking at the fifth event, it's powershell.exe being created with a command line that includes \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". Hmm, this seems like Powershell is trying to create a new drive mapping. The UNC path \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\" stands out because it suggests an attempt to access another system's C drive, which could indicate lateral movement in a network.\n\nThen there are file creations and deletions by powershell.exe in temporary directories. Specifically, creating \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1\" and then deleting it shortly after. This behavior is concerning because creating and immediately deleting files can be part of hiding malicious activities, like dropping a script for execution and then removing evidence.\n\nAlso, the use of cmd.exe with an empty \/c command line is another red flag. Empty commands in cmd are often used to bypass certain security checks or as part of a chain in command execution without leaving much trace.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple powershell instances accessing registry, creating files in temp directories, attempting drive mappings to other systems, and the use of cmd.exe with an empty command lineâ€”all these activities point towards potential malicious behavior. The repeated process creations and deletions suggest someone is trying to cover their tracks or test system boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch does show signs that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances accessing the registry, creating temporary files, and attempting drive mappings.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The logs are all related to process creations and file activities involving PowerShell.exe and other executables.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being created with command lines that look suspicious. For example, the command line in some events is just a placeholder with '{}', which might be an attempt to hide actual commands or inject malicious scripts. This could indicate potential misuse of PowerShell for executing arbitrary code.\n\nNext, there are several FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events. A file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1 is created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior is unusual because creating a script file and immediately deleting it might be an attempt to avoid detection or clean up traces of malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets and ImageLoad events for various DLLs related to .NET and Windows Defender. While these could be part of normal operation, the combination with the PowerShell activities raises suspicion as attackers often load malicious libraries or modify registry settings to maintain persistence.\n\nThe involvement of whoami.exe is another point to consider. Although it's a legitimate tool for checking user information, its execution in the context of other suspicious processes might suggest an attempt to gather system details or elevate privileges.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell with unclear command lines, file manipulations, and potential registry modifications indicate possible malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. So, I've got a batch of events from a system, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst off, looking at the data, most of these events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, creating files, accessing processes, and modifying registry values. For example, there's a file creation event for \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1\" which was then deleted shortly after. That seems a bit suspicious because why create and delete a script so quickly? Could it be testing if the script is allowed or trying to avoid detection?\n\nThen, I notice that there are two instances where whoami.exe was run. This tool typically retrieves information about the current user, but when combined with powershell.exe activity, it might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gather system information. Also, the command line for one of the PowerShell executions is a bit complex: it's checking if a specific file exists and exiting accordingly. That could be part of a larger script to ensure certain tools are present before proceeding.\n\nThe repeated loading of DLLs by powershell.exe might indicate that malicious scripts are trying to execute code or perhaps using legitimate functions in an unusual way. The registry value set event is another red flag because attackers often use the registry to maintain persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating\/deleting a PowerShell script file, running whoami.exe, and multiple DLL loads along with registry modifications suggests potential malicious activity. These actions don't seem like normal user behavior, especially when performed by powershell.exe, which is often targeted by attackers for its scripting capabilities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, process access, registry changes, and execution of external tools like whoami.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading images and accessing files. That in itself isn't suspicious because PowerShell is a common tool used for various legitimate tasks. However, I notice that one of the events mentions deleting a file from a temporary directory: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1\". That caught my attention because script policy test files are often used to check if scripts are allowed to execute, which might be part of a larger script execution.\n\nThen there's an event where cmd.exe is run with the command \"\/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". This command turns off Windows Defender Firewall. It's concerning because disabling the firewall could allow more access for potential threats. I wonder why someone would do that; maybe they're trying to hide something or allow malicious traffic.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of netsh.exe and svchost.exe interacting with the registry. Netsh is often used for network configuration, but when combined with disabling the firewall, it could be part of setting up a persistent backdoor. Svchost.exe is commonly associated with services in Windows, but repeated registry changes by this process might indicate attempts to create or modify malicious services.\n\nPutting all these together: powershell.exe loading and accessing files, deleting a script test file, cmd.exe turning off the firewall, netsh.exe making network changes, and svchost.exe tweaking the registry. It seems like there's a pattern of activities that could be setting up persistence mechanisms or allowing unauthorized access.\n\nThe confidence here is high because these actions collectively point towards potential malicious behavior rather than normal system operations. Each event on its own might not raise red flags, but together they form a concerning narrative.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including disabling firewall and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events. All the entries are the same, so it's repetitive behavior from svchost.exe accessing the registry multiple times.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a common system process, but it's often used by malware to hide their activities. The fact that there are 24 identical events suggests something suspicious might be happening.\n\nMultiple changes in the registry could be part of malicious activity like installing backdoors or creating persistence mechanisms. Since each event shows a registry change without any other file access, it's hard to confirm, but the volume raises my concern.\n\nI think this batch is interesting because while individual events might not be alarming, together they indicate potential tampering that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events showing svchost.exe accessing the registry could indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system logs provided in JSONL format. There are multiple events here, and I need to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first 18 events all show the process as 'svchost.exe' with a task related to registry changes. Specifically, they mention \"Registry object added or deleted\" and one mentions \"Registry value set.\" These are common operations since svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. Frequent registry activity by svchost can be normal, especially during system updates or configuration changes. However, it's also possible for malware to use svchost.exe for malicious purposes.\n\nThen, the next events (events 19-24) are different. They show 'powershell.exe' with a specific command line argument: \n`& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}`\n\nBreaking this down:\n- `New-PSDrive` is a PowerShell cmdlet used to create a new mapped drive.\n- The parameters suggest it's trying to map the network path \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\" as drive G.\n\nThis command line looks suspicious for several reasons. First, using powershell.exe with specific commands can be indicative of script execution. Second, mapping a remote drive, especially one that doesn't resolve to a common network structure (like \"unidade_auxiliar\" which might be a typo or incorrect term), could be an attempt to access another machine's resources without proper authorization.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that this command is repeated multiple times (events 19-24) suggests a potential loop or automated script execution. This kind of repetitive behavior can be a red flag for malicious activities, such as attempting to connect to multiple machines in a brute-force manner or deploying malware across different systems.\n\nNow, considering the combination of all events: There's a significant number of registry modifications by svchost.exe, which alone might not be alarming but could indicate something if combined with other suspicious activities. The presence of powershell.exe executing network mapping commands is more concerning, as it can be used for lateral movement in an attack.\n\nMoreover, the repeated use of svchost.exe and powershell.exe without corresponding legitimate activity (like user-initiated actions or known software updates) adds to the suspicion. It's possible that these events are part of a larger campaign, such as creating persistence mechanisms through registry changes and then attempting network access via PowerShell.\n\nTherefore, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination raises red flags about potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including registry modifications by svchost.exe and repeated PowerShell commands attempting network drive mappings. Indicators of possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. So, I've got a batch of system log events to analyze, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. The key here is to understand what these fields mean and how they correlate across multiple events.\n\nStarting with the first few lines, I notice that several entries have a command line involving powershell.exe. Specifically, some are running commands like 'New-PSDrive' which suggests they're trying to map a network drive or access remote shares. This could be an indicator of potential malicious activity because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and also by attackers for lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe next part I'm looking at is the 'winlog' field, which indicates the type of Windows log event. The tasks listed are either 'Engine Lifecycle' or 'Provider Lifecycle'. These usually relate to how services start, stop, or other events related to system processes. While these in isolation aren't necessarily bad, when combined with unusual PowerShell activity, they could be red flags.\n\nLooking further down, there's a pattern where some entries have powershell.exe commands checking for the existence of a file named 'procdump.exe' at a specific path. The command is using 'Test-Path' to see if this file exists and then exiting with 0 or 1 based on its presence. This could be part of a script trying to check if certain tools are present, possibly indicating an attempt to verify the environment before deploying more malicious activities.\n\nNow, considering that these events repeat multiple timesâ€”each line being almost identical except for minor variationsâ€”it suggests some automated process or script running multiple instances. Such repetitive behavior from a legitimate standpoint is less common and could be part of an attack campaign where attackers are testing different entry points or checking for the presence of specific files across various systems.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that they're using powershell.exe in command lines without any obvious legitimate context (like system administration tasks) makes me more suspicious. Attackers often use such commands to execute malicious scripts or to pivot within a network once they've gained access.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell instances with unusual commands and repeated log entries related to 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events raises concern about potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is attempting to gain access, move laterally, or execute payloads on these systems.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events should be classified as interesting for investigation because the patterns observed are indicative of potentially harmful behavior rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with unusual commands and repeated log entries indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
