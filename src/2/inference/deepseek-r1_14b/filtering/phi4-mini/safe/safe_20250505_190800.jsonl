I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries that all seem related to PowerShell activities on a Windows system.\n\nThe first event shows \"mmc.exe\" being executed and setting a registry value. That's not immediately suspicious by itself, but I know mmc.exe can sometimes be used for malicious purposes if it's accessing unexpected areas or in combination with other actions.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. It starts with creating the process, then loading various image files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are legitimate parts of .NET and PowerShell, so that alone doesn't raise a red flag. But I notice repeated instances of ImageLoad tasks for these DLLs, which might indicate unusual activity if it's happening multiple times.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the Temporary folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. That file name looks suspicious because it's using underscores and has 'ScriptPolicy' in it, which could be part of trying to bypass script execution policies. Moreover, another event shows this file being deleted shortly after its creation. The fact that a script is created and then deleted might suggest an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence for too long.\n\nAnother event creates \"teste.ps1\" in the Downloads folder. PowerShell scripts in the Downloads directory could be risky if they're executed, especially if downloaded from untrusted sources. The command line shows \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\", which is a red flag because it's commonly used by attackers to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple powershell.exe processes, file creations and deletions in temporary folders, script execution with bypass policies, and repeated loading of .NET components. These behaviors could indicate command injection, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The high number of events around PowerShell usage makes me more suspicious because legitimate use would typically not involve such a sequence.\n\nI'm considering the possibility that these logs show an attacker using PowerShell for execution after downloading malicious scripts. The combination of registry changes, file creation\/deletion, and script execution with bypass policies is concerning. However, without seeing signs like network traffic or known indicators of compromise, it's hard to be certain. But given the nature of the actions, especially the use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, I'm leaning towards this being malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creations\/deletions in temporary directories, and execution with bypass policies, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe created a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1\". I know PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's creating a script in the Temp folder might be suspicious because attackers often use temporary files to avoid detection.\n\nThen, the second event says that powershell.exe deleted a file with the same path as the first event. So, it created a file and then immediately deleted it. This behavior seems odd. Why would a legitimate process create and then delete a script? Maybe trying to test something or perhaps attempting to remove evidence after doing something malicious.\n\nThe third event shows that powershell.exe created another file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\". This location is within the Windows PowerShell directory, but I'm not sure what's normal here. It could be part of the system's operation, but again, seeing multiple file operations by powershell.exe raises flags.\n\nPutting it all together, these events suggest that powershell.exe is creating and deleting files in temporary locations, which might indicate script testing or potentially malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe for file operations without a clear legitimate purpose makes this batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation and deletion events by powershell.exe in temporary locations suggest potential script testing or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
