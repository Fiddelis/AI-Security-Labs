{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, there are a bunch of events where \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files. Each event has the same process name and task as \"File created.\" The file paths all point to different JavaScript files within the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory under the user's AppData folder. It looks like each file has a unique hash-like suffix in the filename, which probably means they're different versions or updates.\n\nThen there are three events from \"chrome.exe\" that set registry values. These don't involve any file operations; it's just interacting with the Windows registry.\n\nNow, thinking about what's normal here: Microsoft Office and Chrome are common applications. SDXHelper.exe is likely a helper process for Office, maybe related to updates or extensions. It makes sense for it to create files in the Solution Packages directory since that's where Office-related data might be stored or updated.\n\nThe registry modifications by chrome.exe could be standard operations, like setting preferences or handling settings through the registry, which isn't unusual.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No strange file paths, executable creations outside normal directories, or repeated failed attempts that might indicate a breach. The same process creating multiple files in its own package directory is expected behavior for legitimate software updates or cache management.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem to be part of the regular operation of Office and Chrome. There's nothing here that stands out as suspicious or indicating a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe related to Microsoft Office updates and registry modifications by chrome.exe, which are normal operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me look through each event one by one.\n\nMost of the events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData folder. The file names all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by different hashes, which suggests they might be JavaScript files related to an Office add-in or some similar application.\n\nI notice that many of these events are duplicates; for example, one file path appears twice. That could indicate either a legitimate process creating multiple necessary files or potentially something malicious writing the same file multiple times, but since it's under Microsoft's Office directory, it seems more likely to be part of normal operations.\n\nThere's also an event from \"chrome.exe\" modifying a registry value. While unusual in some contexts, browsers often interact with the registry for extensions or settings, so this might not be suspicious on its own unless there are other signs.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe don't seem out of place if they're part of an Office package update or installation. The only event outside this pattern is from Chrome, which doesn't raise a red flag in isolation. I don't see any indicators of malicious activity here, like multiple processes accessing sensitive areas, failed logins, or unexpected file deletions.\n\nTherefore, while the volume of identical events might seem concerning, they're likely part of a legitimate process. The confidence level is high because there's no evidence of overtly malicious behavior, just repetitive actions that fit expected system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe under the Microsoft Office directory appear to be part of a legitimate process for creating JavaScript files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. They're all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one. Each event has three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nThe \"process\" field consistently shows \"SDXHelper.exe\". I know that SDXHelper is related to Office add-ins or solutions packages. It's usually part of Microsoft Office's setup for add-ins like Copilot or other AI tools. So this seems legitimate.\n\nLooking at the \"winlog\", each event reports a file creation task, specifically mentioning it's under the rule \"FileCreate\". That aligns with normal operations where files are created during installation or updates of software components. It's not an unusual activity in itself.\n\nNow examining the \"file\" paths: all of them point to C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\ followed by a specific package ID, then PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The filenames are variations of officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. These look like JavaScript files, possibly part of the Office add-in's resources.\n\nSo each event is SDXHelper.exe creating a file in an expected location for Office add-ins. There are 16 such events here, all following the same pattern. The repetition suggests that it's part of a process where multiple files need to be created or perhaps they're being written during an update or installation.\n\nI should consider if this kind of activity is normal. Since these are standard operations for Office add-ins, especially with Copilot-related packages, this doesn't raise any red flags immediately. There's no indication of unusual file names, locations outside the expected paths, or activities like deletion or modification that could hint at malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes for their activities. But in this case, the process name and file paths align with known legitimate functions of Office add-ins. The number of files being created doesn't seem excessive beyond what an update might require.\n\nI also note that some file hashes are repeated, like \"8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\" appearing multiple times in the package ID. This suggests it's a single package being updated or installed with several resource files.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as NOT INTERESTING because the activities are within normal operational parameters for Office software and don't exhibit signs of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Office add-ins.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files. These files have paths related to Office packages and contain names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\". This seems normal for an Office-related process, possibly part of updates or feature deployments. However, the repetitive nature of these events with different file hashes could indicate something more concerning, like multiple components being written to disk quickly, which might be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThen, looking at \"chrome.exe\" logs, there are several activities: creating files in the Downloads folder, DNS queries, and registry modifications. The creation of both the main file and its Zone.Identifier suggests that Chrome is handling downloads correctly, marking them as from the internet. However, repeated file stream creations on the same path could be a red flag for potential tampering or multiple writes to the same file, which might not be typical.\n\nThe \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a configuration file seems benign, likely part of log shipping or monitoring setup, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nOther entries include processes like Excel loading various DLLs and svchost.exe making registry changes. These are standard behaviors for legitimate applications and system services, so they don't raise any alarms on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated file creation events by \"SDXHelper.exe\" and \"chrome.exe\" could be worth investigating further. While individually these actions might not indicate malicious intent, the volume and specific patterns (like multiple similar files being created) might suggest something more nefarious, such as a potential file injection attack or persistence mechanism.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING due to the possible signs of unusual file activity that could be indicative of an exploit or suspicious behavior.

Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first 18 entries are all from EXCEL.EXE setting registry values. That seems a bit repetitive but not necessarily suspicious on its own. Excel is known to interact with the registry for settings and configurations, so multiple such events might be normal, especially if there's some customization or add-on being loaded.\n\nThen, I notice that after those entries, there are four events from SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData folder. The file names look like they're part of JavaScript resources for Office packages, such as \"office.js\" and various string files. This also doesn't immediately raise red flags because these could be legitimate parts of Office add-ins or custom solutions being loaded.\n\nHowever, I should consider the context. If this is a user with Excel installed and using Office features, these activities might be normal. But if there's no apparent reason for so many registry writes from Excel, it might warrant closer look. Additionally, the file creation by SDXHelper.exe—since it's part of Microsoft Office, perhaps it's related to some updates or add-ins being deployed.\n\nBut considering all events together, while each action isn't malicious on its own, the volume and specific actions could be indicators. The repeated registry writes might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms if done by an unknown process. Similarly, creating multiple files in specific paths could be part of a payload delivery.\n\nOn balance, there's some cause for concern but not definitive evidence of malicious activity. It's possible these are legitimate operations, especially since they're related to Microsoft Excel and Office components. However, the repetitive nature might still suggest something unusual.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry writes from EXCEL.EXE and file creations by SDXHelper.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

My first thought is that SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—it's probably part of some legitimate software, maybe Microsoft Office since it's related to Office Solution Packages.\n\nEach event is a file creation under various language paths like en-gb, es-es, etc. This makes me think the system is setting up localized resources for different regions. The repetition suggests that this is part of a normal setup or update process. It doesn't seem unusual because applications often handle multiple languages to support their users globally.\n\nI don't see any red flags here, like access to restricted areas or attempts to execute code. These events are straightforward file creations in expected locations. Since all the paths are within standard Microsoft directories and the filenames are consistent with resource files, it's unlikely they're malicious.\n\nConsidering confidence, I'm pretty sure this is normal behavior.

The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving different processes like EXCEL.EXE, svchost.exe, HxTsr.exe, and Explorer.EXE. The tasks logged include things like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and so on. \n\nStarting with the first event: it's Excel loading an image from C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. That seems normal because system files are typically part of standard operations. Next, another Excel process loads coml2.dll from the same directory—also a known system file, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's an event where Excel creates a file in the user's Downloads folder: ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde (~) indicates it might be a temporary or backup file, which is common when saving documents. Not unusual at all.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe is involved in several registry value sets. SvcHost is a standard Windows process that hosts various services, and modifying the registry isn't uncommon for legitimate operations. But since these are multiple instances, I should consider if this is part of normal activity or something more nefarious. However, without seeing any malicious indicators like changes to known bad keys, it's hard to classify this as suspicious.\n\nAnother event has SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. SDXHelper is often related to Office add-ins or scripts, and creating files there seems legitimate for package resources. The paths look standard, so I don't see any red flags here.\n\nThere are multiple instances of EXCEL.EXE loading various DLLs from the system32 directory, which again points to normal operations since Excel relies on these libraries. Also, the creation of files in user-specific directories like AppData and Recent for Office documents is expected behavior when saving or opening files.\n\nI also notice some FileCreateStreamHash events related to EXCEL.EXE. These might be part of how Excel handles file streams and metadata, which isn't typically malicious unless there's an attempt to write to unexpected locations, but here the paths seem legitimate.\n\nThe Registry value sets by both Excel and Explorer.exe could be concerning if they were modifying sensitive keys, but without specific details on what registry entries are being changed, it's hard to assess. However, given that these processes often interact with the registry for settings and configurations, it might just be normal activity.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are several events from EXCEL.EXE and other processes, none of them individually or collectively seem to indicate malicious behavior. The activities described are within the bounds of what one would expect from a user interacting normally with Excel and system processes. There's no evidence of unusual file accesses, writes to unexpected locations, or modifications to critical security components. Therefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal user activity involving Excel and system processes with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" where the task is \"Registry value set\". There are 20 such entries. Now, Excel doing registry writes isn't unusual because many applications do that for configuration purposes. But when you have so many repetitive actions from the same process, it might raise an eyebrow. Could this be part of a malicious activity like persistence or data exfiltration? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". These show file creation tasks pointing to specific paths under the user's AppData directory. The files created have names that look like JavaScript files, possibly related to UI strings for different language locales. This also seems normal because applications often cache or load such resources when running.\n\nBut wait, why are there multiple identical events? If \"EXCEL.EXE\" is writing registry values repeatedly, maybe it's part of a legitimate process but could indicate tampering if done excessively. On the other hand, \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating several files in a loop might be part of an update or language package installation.\n\nI'm thinking about possible malicious behaviors. Registry writes can be used for persistence, but Excel is a common target for malware. However, in this case, all events are similar and come from the same process without any signs of other activities like network traffic or file deletions.\n\nThe files created by SDXHelper.exe are localized strings, which doesn't seem suspicious on its own. It might be part of Office's setup or updates.\n\nPutting it all together, while some isolated actions could look suspicious, the entire batch seems to be normal operations without any clear indicators of malicious intent. There's no variation in the events, and they don't point to known attack vectors beyond standard application behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal Excel operation (registry writes) and legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe for language resources.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a bunch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single classification with justification and confidence.\n\nFirst, looking at the events. There are multiple entries where \"process\" is \"SDXHelper.exe\", and the task is \"File created\". Each of these has different file paths under the same user's AppData directory. These files seem to be related to language strings for UI in various locales like gu-in, he-il, etc. So SDXHelper is creating multiple files in an Office package resource.\n\nThen there's another event with \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a new .yml file. That might just be the log shipping tool setting up its configuration, so probably normal.\n\nAfter that, most of the events are from \"EXCEL.EXE\" and \"svchost.exe\". EXCEL is doing DNS queries and making several registry changes. Svchost, which is a common system process, also has some registry activity—values being set and objects added\/deleted.\n\nSo I need to analyze this as a whole batch. Let me consider the context of each process:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe**: This seems related to Microsoft Office's solution packages. The files created are for UI language strings, which is normal during setup or updates. It's creating multiple locale-specific files, which makes sense if the system has international settings.\n\n2. **winlogbeat.exe**: Creating a config file is standard behavior for log management tools. No red flags here.\n\n3. **EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe**: EXCEL doing DNS queries might be to check updates or something online. The registry writes could be part of normal operation, especially if Excel is adjusting settings or extensions. Svchost's activity is tricky since it's a common process for services, but the repeated Registry events without other indicators might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nLooking at the file paths in the SDXHelper.exe events: They're all under the same user's AppData Local Microsoft Office directory. This seems legitimate as Office packages often store resources there.\n\nThe batch has a lot of similar events from the same processes, which could indicate bulk operations but not necessarily malicious unless they deviate from normal patterns. The files created by SDXHelper are expected in an update or installation scenario. If this happened during an Office update, it's totally normal.\n\nEXCEL.EXE accessing DNS and registry: Could be for legitimate purposes like checking updates or initializing settings. Without seeing unusual times or multiple failed attempts, it doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nSvchost.exe is known to host various services, so some Registry activity is expected. The exact actions here don't seem out of place unless they're part of a known exploit, which I don't have evidence for here.\n\nPutting it all together: All the events seem within normal operational parameters. No signs of unusual file creation in restricted areas, no unexpected process behavior, and standard log shipping and application activity. There's no indication of exfiltration, strange network traffic, or unauthorized access attempts across the batch.\n\nTherefore, I'd classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because none of the events suggest malicious activity or anomalies when considered together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities, including file creation by Microsoft Office-related processes and log management tools.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, they all seem similar but let me check them one by one. The first few entries are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths. For example:\n\n- C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\... with various file names.\n\nI notice that the process name is consistent across these events, all coming from SDXHelper.exe. The task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates file creation events.\n\nThe file paths point to different language-specific strings JSON files under the OfflineFiles folder in various SolutionPackage directories. Each file has a unique hash-like suffix, like _07aa48624a0778bb5f2a77d657aaf34a.js. These look like resource files for different languages.\n\nThen there's an event from \"EXCEL.EXE\" setting a registry value. This is just one event amidst several others, so it's not the main focus here.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting or not. Since all these file creation events are from SDXHelper.exe and they're creating language string files, I'm thinking about what SDXHelper does. From my knowledge, SDXHelper is often associated with Microsoft Office add-ins or components that manage language packs or resources. These files are likely part of the localized strings used in Office applications.\n\nThe pattern here is multiple file creations from the same process, all within known Microsoft Office directories. There's no indication of any unusual behavior, such as writes to system critical areas, access to restricted files, or any deviations from expected operations. The files being created are standard for language resources.\n\nI should also check if there's anything irregular in the timestamps or frequency of these events, but since I don't have that information here, I'll assume they're happening within normal intervals during a user session.\n\nThe one event from Excel setting a registry value is probably just part of its configuration process. It doesn't stand out as malicious on its own.\n\nGiven all this, the activities seem benign and related to normal Office operations.
