{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events provided in JSONL format. Each event is a log entry where the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" and the task is \"File created\". The files being created are all under a specific path within the user's AppData directory, specifically related to Microsoft Office's Solution Packages for Excel Copilot.\n\nFirst off, I need to determine if this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down each event. Each one shows that SDXHelper.exe is creating a file in an \"OfflineFiles\" folder under the Excel add-in package resources. The filenames vary but follow a pattern, all starting with \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_\" and ending with different hashes or identifiers.\n\nNow, considering that these are file creation events, it's important to assess whether this activity is normal or could indicate malicious behavior. SDXHelper.exe sounds like it might be a legitimate Windows process, possibly related to system diagnostics or updates. Microsoft Office add-ins often create temporary or cache files, so the presence of multiple such files isn't immediately suspicious.\n\nHowever, I should consider the volume and context. There are 14 events in this batch, each creating a file with a unique name under the same directory. While it's possible for an application to generate several files during its operation, especially if it's caching resources or updating, an unusually high number could be a red flag. But in this case, since all files are within a structured and known Microsoft Office directory, it seems more like standard behavior.\n\nI should also check the file paths for any anomalies. The path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\" is typical for user-specific application data. The fact that they're under SolutionPackages and PackageResources suggests these are components of an Office add-in, which aligns with legitimate operations.\n\nAnother angle is to consider whether the creation of JavaScript files (as indicated by .js extensions) in this directory is normal. Excel Copilot might include string resources packaged as JS files, so their presence makes sense. If these were EXEs or other executable types, it might raise more concern, but JS files are common in web-based resources.\n\nI should also think about the source of SDXHelper.exe. A quick search in my knowledge base tells me that \"SDXHelper\" could be related to various legitimate tools and processes, possibly used for system updates or diagnostics. If it's a known component associated with Microsoft Office, then its activity would be expected.\n\nLooking at each event individually isn't the approach here; I need to analyze the entire batch. The repetition of similar file creation events under the same process and path suggests a routine task rather than malicious activity. It's more likely that this is part of the normal operation of the Excel add-in, perhaps during an update or cache refresh.\n\nPotential red flags would include unexpected locations outside known directories, executable files being created, or processes running with elevated privileges. None of these are present here, so there's no strong indication of malicious intent.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to keep an eye on file creation events, especially in user directories, this batch doesn't exhibit signs that would classify it as interesting from a security standpoint. It appears to be normal operational behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by SDXHelper.exe under a Microsoft Office directory, which is likely part of legitimate Excel Copilot operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each line is a separate event, and they all seem to have the same structure. Let me break down what each part means.\n\nFirst, every event has a \"process\" field with the name \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests that all these actions are being taken by the same process. SDXHelper might be some legitimate software tool or perhaps something malicious, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, the \"winlog\" field indicates that the task is a file creation event triggered by a rule called \"FileCreate\". So each of these events is logging the creation of a new file. That makes sense because if files are being created frequently, it could be part of normal operations or something suspicious like data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the \"file\" paths, they all point to the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The filenames vary, but they all follow a pattern like excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_ followed by a hash. These hashes are likely unique identifiers for each file.\n\nI notice that some of the file paths repeat, such as \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_86ba5bba225de51a895b0be3e7d18f6f.js\" appearing twice. That might indicate an attempt to write the same file multiple times or perhaps a mistake in processing.\n\nPutting this together, SDXHelper.exe is creating several JavaScript files in a specific directory under the user's AppData folder. The repetition of filenames suggests that maybe these are being overwritten or duplicated, which could be normal for certain applications that cache files, but it might also be a sign of malicious activity trying to establish persistence or store data.\n\nI'm considering whether this behavior is typical. Applications like Microsoft Office often have helper processes and use temporary or cache directories. However, the specific naming convention with long hashes and the fact that multiple files are being created rapidly could raise flags. Malware sometimes uses such techniques to hide files or exfiltrate data.\n\nAnother angle is user permissions. If SDXHelper.exe doesn't have legitimate reasons to create numerous files in this directory, especially with these filenames, it might be suspicious. Additionally, repeated file creation attempts without clear purpose could indicate a process trying to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nHowever, without more context about what SDXHelper.exe does or whether it's known as a benign application, it's hard to be certain. It's possible that this is part of normal operations for an Office add-in or update process. But the sheer number of files and their naming could also suggest something more nefarious.\n\nI'm thinking about confidence levels here. While there are red flags, like repeated file writes and unusual filenames, I don't have enough information to definitively classify this as malicious. It's possible that these are legitimate cache files, especially given that they're under the Office directory. On the other hand, the volume might indicate something suspicious.\n\nSo, weighing all this, my initial thought is that while there are some concerning signs, it's not conclusive evidence of malicious activity. Therefore, I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" because it's worth investigating further to determine if these files are part of normal operations or a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in the same directory, with repetitive filenames suggesting potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here.

The file paths look like they're part of Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, specifically under OfflineFiles. The filenames vary but follow a pattern with GUIDs and various strings, some related to Excel and Office AI Copilot.\n\nI notice that many of these events are duplicates—same process creating the same files multiple times. That repetition might not be too concerning on its own because sometimes legitimate processes write or overwrite files repeatedly. However, the sheer number of similar events could be a red flag if it's beyond normal operation.\n\nThen there's an event from \"cleanmgr.exe\" being executed. Cleanmgr is known as the Disk Cleanup utility in Windows. It's a standard system tool, so its process creation doesn't immediately raise alarms unless it's behaving abnormally here, which it doesn't seem to be based on this log alone.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many file creations from SDXHelper.exe? That could indicate something malicious if the files aren't legitimate. The paths and filenames look like they might be part of Office add-ins or components, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe these are related to Copilot features in Excel that require multiple JavaScript resources.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is within normal operating parameters for an office environment. If a user is actively using Office applications with various AI features enabled, it's plausible that the system would create multiple files in the OfflineFiles directory as part of syncing or caching data. However, the volume here seems high—14 events, many duplicates—so maybe it's worth double-checking.\n\nAnother angle: Could these file creations be part of a persistence mechanism used by malware? Sometimes attackers use legitimate tools' names and processes to hide their activities. But in this case, SDXHelper.exe sounds like a Microsoft-related tool, which makes me think it's more likely legitimate.\n\nOn the other hand, if all these files are being created in quick succession or outside of user interaction, that might be suspicious. But without timestamps, it's hard to gauge the frequency here.\n\nI should also check if any of these files have known malicious signatures or if the process is behaving abnormally beyond just creating files. The logs don't show any other activities like network communications or changes to system configurations, which are often signs of malicious behavior.\n\nIn summary, while the number of file creation events stands out, they seem consistent with legitimate Office operations, especially around Copilot features. However, without more context, there's a small chance that this could be something nefarious mimicking these processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation activities by Microsoft Office components and do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one. The first few lines all have the same structure: the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file path points to various JavaScript files under a specific user's AppData Local Microsoft Office directory.\n\nI notice that multiple events are creating files with different filenames but the same base path. The paths look like they're related to Excel Copilot strings, varying by some suffix in the filename. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings_ae472176788f34d49d54e390a436dca9.js\" and others.\n\nLooking at these events, it's a bit concerning because there are several identical file creation events for the same process. But I also need to consider that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, particularly related to managing Solution Packages like Copilot features. These packages often contain various resources, including JavaScript files, which might be necessary for the Copilot functionality.\n\nEach event creates a different file, but all are in the same directory structure. The repetition could be due to multiple resource files being deployed or updated when Copilot is used. However, it's also possible that an attacker is creating many files as part of a malicious activity, like dropping multiple payloads or establishing persistence.\n\nBut considering that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate process and these files are under the expected Microsoft Office directory structure, the creation of several JavaScript files seems normal for such an environment. The user's context (fiddelis) doesn't raise any immediate flags unless there's specific information about this user being associated with malicious activities.\n\nI should also check if all events are from the same process and same file path. Since they're all under \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\", it aligns with how Microsoft Office handles resources, especially for features like Copilot which might require multiple script files.\n\nThe next event is different: \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a new configuration file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipper that collects Windows logs, so this seems legitimate as well.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are many file creation events from SDXHelper.exe, they fit within expected behavior for Microsoft Office components.

The process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" every time, so that's consistent across all events. The task in the winlog is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating a file creation event. The files being created are located under the same path but have different filenames with varying hashes.\n\nI notice that each file has a name like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by a long hash string, which seems to be unique for each entry.

The specific subfolders like SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles seem to be part of how Office handles its add-ins or solutions.\n\nThe file names are all JavaScript files with various hash-like suffixes, such as \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" or \"word-copilot.min_...\". These look like they could be part of the Copilot feature in Word, which is a AI-assisted writing tool. The hashes might indicate different versions or updates being applied.\n\nNow, considering each event is a file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If this process runs periodically for updates, creating multiple files at once isn't unusual. However, the number of events here—14 in total—is something to note. Is it typical for an update process to create so many files? It might depend on how many resources are being updated or cached.\n\nI should also consider whether these file paths and names align with known legitimate activities. Since they're related to Office's Copilot, which is a standard feature, this seems within normal operations unless there's evidence of tampering or unusual access times.\n\nAnother angle: the volume of file creation events. If SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files in quick succession, it might be part of a legitimate update process. But if these files are being created outside of expected times (like during non-business hours), that could raise flags. However, without timestamps, I can't assess the timing here.\n\nI also need to think about whether there's any evidence of file deletion or modification after creation, which might indicate malicious activity. Since each event is just a creation, it doesn't provide further context on what happens afterward.\n\nMoreover, the uniformity in the process name and task type suggests this isn't a scattered set of activities but rather a batch operation by a single process, which aligns with legitimate software behavior during updates or installations.\n\nIn summary, while I can't rule out any possibility without more data, the information given points towards normal operations related to Microsoft Office's Copilot feature. The repetitive nature and file paths don't indicate signs of malicious activity based on the provided details.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process, which is associated with Microsoft Office updates or maintenance. The files created are part of the Copilot feature and follow standard naming conventions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
