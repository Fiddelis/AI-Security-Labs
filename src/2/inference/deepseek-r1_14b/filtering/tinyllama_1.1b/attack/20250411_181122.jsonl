I'm seeing multiple entries related to PowerShell execution with specific command lines. The commands are using `findstr` and `select-string`, which often indicate script activity searching for certain patterns like \"password\". That could be malicious.\n\nThere are several instances where the same PowerShell command is executed, suggesting repeated attempts or part of a larger script. This repetition might be an attempt to gather sensitive information across various files, which raises red flags.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events and registry modifications by PowerShell, which can be signs of persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration. The use of `powershell.exe` with such commands is commonly associated with attack techniques, like credential harvesting.\n\nThe other processes like OfficeClickToRun.exe making DNS queries might be normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it adds to the concern. Overall, the batch shows behavior that aligns with potential malicious activity, so I'd classify this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to execute PowerShell commands searching for sensitive information (password-related patterns), which could indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to processes like chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and WMIC.exe. The tasks include things like DNS queries, file creations, image loads, network connections, process accesses, and registry value sets.\n\nI notice that chrome.exe is doing a lot of normal activities: loading DLLs (amsi.dll), making network connections. That seems standard for a browser. Similarly, winlogbeat.exe is creating files related to its configuration, which is expected if it's an agent collecting logs.\n\nNow, the interesting parts come with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is known for being both legitimate and malicious because of its scripting capabilities. Here, I see powershell.exe creating files (objeto_logico.txt, estrutura_ativo.txt) in a user's Downloads folder. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but the naming seems genericâ€”could be either benign or part of malicious activity like file creation for data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at cmd.exe, there are command lines that delete scheduled tasks. The command lines show deleting specific task names related to \"OnLogon\" and \"OnStartup\". This is suspicious because removing scheduled tasks can be a way to avoid persistence mechanisms or remove traces left by malware. Malicious actors often clean up their tracks by disabling or removing such tasks.\n\nThen, there's schtasks.exe being used with delete commands as well. SchTasks is the command-line tool for Scheduled Tasks. Again, deleting tasks could indicate someone trying to remove persistence vectors. This behavior raises flags because legitimate users rarely need to delete system tasks so specifically unless they're cleaning up after an infection.\n\nWMIC.exe is another red flag. It's used with a command to delete a process where name='notepad.exe'. That's concerning because WMIC can be used for remote command execution and process management. Deleting Notepad might seem harmless, but the way it's done (using quotes and escaping) looks like it could be part of a script meant to remove traces or prevent certain processes from running. Additionally, loading DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll via WMIC could indicate attempts to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of deleting scheduled tasks and using WMIC for potentially malicious process management. These actions are not typical user behavior and are often associated with malware trying to remove persistence or disrupt system operations. The combination of powershell.exe creating files, cmd.exe deleting tasks, and WMIC.exe's activity suggests a possible attack chain where an adversary is attempting to clean up after establishing initial access or moving laterally.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level here. While some actions could be innocent (like chrome.exe activities), the repeated use of command-line tools for task deletion and process management points towards malicious intent. The specific naming of files created by powershell doesn't stand out as obviously malicious, but when combined with the other events, it strengthens the case.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there's a pattern of potentially malicious activities that together suggest a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including deletion of scheduled tasks and use of WMIC for potential process management. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as cleaning up traces or removing persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are involved. Specifically, there are several instances of Registry value sets (rule: RegistryEvent). That stands out because modifying the registry is a common tactic in malicious activities to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nThen, there's an event where cmd.exe deletes a file from a temporary directory. The command line shows it's deleting files related to some executables with names like \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\". This deletion could be part of cleaning up after malicious activities to remove traces.\n\nAlso, there are Process Create events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe. While these can be legitimate, their repeated use alongside other suspicious actions might indicate they're being used as part of a script or batch process that's not typical user behavior.\n\nLooking further, some entries have command lines that don't seem standard. For example, the cmd.exe command uses del with specific paths, which could be deleting files in a way that's trying to hide something. Additionally, powershell.exe is accessed multiple times without clear legitimate usage context, and there are instances where the command line for powershell.exe is just \"& {}\", which seems unusual and possibly an attempt to run commands without logging them properly.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of registry modifications, file deletions from temporary directories, and non-standard use of common tools like cmd and powershell suggests potential malicious activity. These behaviors are often indicators of compromise, such as persistence mechanisms or attempts to cover tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications, file deletions from temporary directories, and non-standard process activities indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involve powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administration tasks and malicious activities. So, multiple instances of it running might be a red flag. But I should check the specific actions associated with each event.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they mention tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', and various 'Image Load' events. These could just be normal operations for PowerShell starting up or initializing modules. However, the repeated occurrence of these might indicate something more than usual.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value sets in PowerShell processes. Modifying the registry can be part of malicious activities to persistence or alter system configurations. But again, sometimes scripts do legitimate tasks using the registry, so I need to consider context.\n\nI see that whoami.exe is being executed a few times. Whoami is often used to check user permissions and might be innocent, but if it's part of a larger script or attack chain, it could be relevant.\n\nOther processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe are also present. These aren't immediately suspicious on their own, but the combination with powershell.exe activity might raise eyebrows.\n\nThe fact that so many events involve powershell.exe and registry modifications suggests possible malicious behavior, such as script execution or persistence mechanisms. The repeated Process Create events for whoami.exe could be part of an attempt to gather information about the system.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or additional event data, it's hard to definitively say these are malicious. But given the volume and nature of the activities, they do raise concerns and would likely warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances with registry modifications and process creations may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me try to understand what each event is saying and whether together they indicate something interesting or not.\n\nFirst event: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's normal because those are standard Windows processes handling basic tasks.\n\nSecond event: svchost.exe modifying a registry value. Svchost is part of the services.exe, which runs various system services. It's common for it to make registry changes, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool that's monitoring logs, so it's normal for it to create configuration files.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell can be used both benignly and maliciously, but without more context like command-line arguments or other indicators of compromise, this alone isn't concerning.\n\nThe next five events all relate to chrome.exe:\n- Three Dns queries, which are normal for a browser accessing websites.\n- Two Network connection events, also typical as Chrome communicates over the internet.\n\nLooking at all these together, each individual event is within normal operational ranges. There's no evidence of unusual file accesses, processes running out of place, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks or unauthorized access. No process names stand out as malicious beyond what a standard system would handle. The repetition from Chrome could be due to multiple tabs or extensions, which isn't uncommon.\n\nI don't see any red flags in the combination of these events that would suggest malicious activity or system compromise. Everything aligns with regular user activities and system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are within normal operational ranges, including standard processes like Calculator.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe, and Chrome activity such as DNS queries and network connections.
