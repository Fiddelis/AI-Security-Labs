{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of entries related to PowerShell and svchost.exe. PowerShell is commonly used in both legitimate scripts and malicious activities, so that catches my attention immediately. The fact that there are multiple ImageLoad and FileCreate tasks associated with powershell.exe makes me think someone might be executing scripts or loading modules, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking deeper, one of the events shows a file being created at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1\". Temporary files like this can be a red flag because attackers often use such locations to store malicious scripts temporarily. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like it's trying to bypass script execution policies, another suspicious activity.\n\nThen there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks from both powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Modifying the registry is a common tactic for persistence or configuration changes. The fact that these events are happening repeatedly could indicate an attempt to create or modify registry keys for malicious purposes, like enabling services or changing configurations to allow further access.\n\nI also notice that some of the events don't have associated file paths (file: None), which might mean the process is interacting with other resources like network connections or other system components. The combination of multiple processes accessing and modifying different parts of the system could be indicative of a broader attack vector.\n\nTaking into account all these points, it seems like this batch of events shows signs of potentially malicious activities such as script execution, registry modifications, and file creation in temporary locations. While some of these actions could be legitimate (like system updates or user scripts), the volume and specific tasks suggest a higher risk. However, without more context on the environment and the baseline behavior, it's hard to be certain. But given the indicators present, I would lean towards classifying this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe activity including file creation in a temporary directory and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst off, all these events are related to the same process: powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware might use it to hide or execute commands.\n\nLooking at the tasks, I see things like Image loaded, File created, Pipe Created, Process accessed, Registry value set, and more. These are common actions that could be part of normal operations, but in combination, they might indicate something suspicious.\n\nOne event stands out where a file is created: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's an unusual path. Malware often creates new files to store configurations or logs, which could be part of setting up persistence.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple instances where MpClient.dll and MpOAV.dll are loaded from the Windows Defender directory. These are legitimate files, but seeing them being loaded repeatedly by PowerShell might not be normal. It could be an attempt to mimic legitimate behavior while hiding malicious activities.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1. Temporary files created by scripts can be a sign of testing or execution, especially with PowerShell scripts, which are common in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there's an instance where whoami.exe is executed twice. This could be used to gather information about the system, which is often part of early stages of an attack to understand the environment.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events and the combination of file operations, process creations, and registry changes make me suspicious. It seems like a potential attempt to establish persistence or lateral movement within the system. The use of multiple image loads and process accesses might be trying to hide activities by blending in with normal traffic.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it's likely that this batch of events isn't just random noise but part of some coordinated activity, possibly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell and file operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from svchost.exe with tasks related to registry changes and some pipe creations. Then there are a bunch of powershell.exe processes running command lines that involve creating drives to a remote target like \\\\Target\\\\C$. Wait, but I notice that in some cases, the command line is just 'powershell.exe &' without any arguments. That's odd.\n\nI remember that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by services, so it's common to see it in logs, and registry activity isn't always suspicious on its own. But when combined with powershell.exe activities, especially ones that create drives to remote locations, that could be a red flag for something like remote access or persistence.\n\nThe command line 'New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$' seems suspicious because it's trying to map a drive to a remote share. This kind of activity is often used in attacks to gain access to other systems on the network, which could be part of lateral movement.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is called without any arguments, just 'powershell.exe & {}'. That might be an attempt to execute something else or maybe a failed command. Either way, it's unusual and worth looking into because empty command lines can sometimes indicate obfuscation or attempts to hide malicious activity.\n\nThe fact that there are several such events over time suggests possible repeated attempts at accessing the network or executing commands without any clear legitimate reason. This could be part of a larger attack campaign trying to establish persistence or move laterally within the network.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these two processes (svchost.exe and powershell.exe) might work together. If svchost is making registry changes, maybe it's installing a service or a startup script that runs via powershell. Or perhaps the powershell commands are being executed with elevated privileges from svchost.\n\nPutting it all together, even though individual events aren't necessarily malicious on their own, the combination of multiple suspicious activities like repeated remote drive mappings and empty powershell executions is concerning. It's likely an indicator of potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving svchost.exe modifying the registry and powershell.exe executing potentially suspicious commands, including attempts to create remote drives.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe activities. There are a few whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes too, but the majority involve PowerShell, which is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe accessing something via ProcessAccess. Not sure what that means yet. Then there's a whoami.exe process create—probably just a legitimate user checking their permissions or something.\n\nThe next event is interesting: powershell.exe being run with a specific command line argument. The command seems to be creating a new PS drive pointing to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". That looks like it's trying to access another machine, maybe for lateral movement? Or perhaps mounting a remote drive as part of some script execution.\n\nThen there are several events where PowerShell is accessing various files and registry keys. For example, loading different DLLs (clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll) which could be normal if they're legitimate libraries, but sometimes attackers load malicious modules or use reflective DLL injection. Also, there's a file deletion event: deleting a .ps1 script in the Temp folder, which might indicate that a script was executed and then cleaned up to erase evidence.\n\nAnother event is creating a new file in the StartupProfileData directory—could be writing some configuration or persistence mechanism there. Persistence is a common tactic for attackers to maintain access over reboots.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events from powershell.exe. These could be normal if it's part of legitimate script execution, but in the context of other suspicious activities like file deletion and remote drive mounting, they raise flags.\n\nThe cmd.exe process is just a create event with an empty command line—could be anything, but without more info, it's hard to say. But considering all these together, there's definitely some concerning behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes creating drives, accessing files and registry, deleting temporary scripts, and trying to load various modules. These are classic signs of potential malicious activity, like script execution, lateral movement, or persistence mechanisms. The combination suggests that an attacker might be using PowerShell for command and control or to execute malicious scripts.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. There's a high likelihood here because the activities aren't isolated but part of a series of events that together form a narrative pointing towards potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show signs of script execution, file deletion, and remote drive access, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze a batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are provided in JSONL format, with each line being a JSON object containing some event data.\n\nLooking at the first log entry: it has \"process\" with command_line as 'powershell.exe & {}'. The \"winlog\" field shows the task is \"Engine Lifecycle\", and there's no file information. This seems like a basic PowerShell execution without any specific arguments, which could be normal user activity or part of system processes.\n\nThe next entries are similar but more detailed. The command line includes a path check for 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe'. So it's using a PowerShell script to check if this file exists and then exits with 0 or 1 based on the result. The task in winlog is \"Provider Lifecycle\" for most entries, except one which is \"Engine Lifecycle\".\n\nI notice that many events are repeating the same command line, just with different tasks in the winlog. This repetition might indicate a script running multiple times or part of a larger process.\n\nCould this be malicious? PowerShell scripts checking file existence don't inherently seem suspicious, but if this activity happens outside normal business hours or follows an unusual pattern, it could be worth investigating. Alternatively, it might be a legitimate check by an application to ensure certain tools are present.\n\nHowever, without additional context like timestamps, user information, or other related events (such as file access after the checks), it's hard to determine if this is malicious behavior. The lack of any file field in these logs also means we can't see if any files were accessed or modified during these processes.\n\nConsidering all this, while the repeated PowerShell commands with specific paths could be concerning, they don't provide enough evidence on their own to classify as definitely malicious. But they do stand out enough that further investigation might be warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell command attempts checking for the existence of a specific file, which may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
