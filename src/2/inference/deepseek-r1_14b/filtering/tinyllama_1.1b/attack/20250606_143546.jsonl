Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few lines are all from powershell.exe accessing processes and loading images. That seems a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. I remember that attackers sometimes use PowerShell to execute scripts or download malware, so repeated accesses could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a file created by powershell.exe in a temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1. That looks like it's testing some script policy, but I'm not sure if that's normal behavior. Also, multiple ImageLoad events from different DLLs might indicate that powershell.exe is loading various components or modules.\n\nThen there are entries from svchost.exe, which is a common system process used by services. However, the files it's creating in C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download seem like they could be related to Windows Update, but the paths and filenames (like UpdateAgent.dll) don't immediately ring alarm bells. Still, if svchost.exe is involved in multiple FileCreate events, that might be part of normal operations or something more nefarious.\n\nI also notice that there are Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Modifying the registry can be a sign of malicious activity because attackers often persistence by setting registry keys.\n\nAnother point is the RuntimeBroker.exe loading urlmon.dll, which seems standard, but I'm not certain if that's anything to worry about.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell.exe instances creating files and accessing various system DLLs, along with svchost.exe modifying files and the registry. It feels like there might be some malicious activity, especially since PowerShell is involved. However, it could also just be normal operations, like script execution or service updates.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while some events are common, the combination of multiple powershell.exe activities, file creations in temp directories, and registry modifications raises suspicions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system files and creating temporary scripts, along with svchost.exe modifying files and the registry, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events are from svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files in SoftwareDistribution directories. That's normal because svchost is a legitimate system process handling services, so those activities aren't suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there are some file creations under different paths, like edbtmp.log and others. These could be part of Windows Update or servicing components, which again seem routine unless something points to malicious behavior.\n\nLooking further down, I see MpSigStub.exe loading MpClient.dll. That's expected since it's related to Windows Defender. The pipe creation is also normal for inter-process communication.\n\nNext up are setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. This might be part of an update or installation process, so nothing unusual there.\n\nThe critical point comes when I spot powershell.exe events. One event shows a command line with a script that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and sets its binary path to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThe fact that the command line includes creating a new service suggests potential persistence mechanisms, which are red flags for malicious activities. The paths in the binary path name look suspicious too, as they don't follow standard naming conventions and might be obfuscated or misleading.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe accessing processes and loading .NET frameworks is normal, but combined with the creation of a service via script, it raises the alarm. This could indicate that an attacker is setting up a persistent backdoor or deploying malicious software.\n\nTaking all these events together, especially focusing on the PowerShell activity creating a new service with a suspicious binary path, I'm confident this batch shows potentially malicious behavior. Therefore, it's definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activity involving powershell.exe executing commands to create a new service and references to external binaries with unusual paths.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, several entries show PowerShell.exe being used. That's a common tool for both admins and attackers because it has scripting capabilities and can do many things under the hood. I remember that malicious actors often use PowerShell to execute scripts, which can be obfuscated or do bad things on the system. \n\nLooking at the specific events involving PowerShell, there are file creations and deletions in temporary directories. For example, a script is created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a somewhat random-looking name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. Then it's deleted shortly after. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell loading various DLLs. While that's normal for scripts, especially those using .NET or other libraries, the combination with other activities might raise a flag. Additionally, there are Pipe Created events, which can be used for communication between processes, potentially to hide malicious activity or exfiltrate data.\n\nThen I notice another process called tarefa_logico.exe loading some .NET DLLs. The name \"tarefa_logico\" translates to \"logical_task\" in Portuguese, which doesn't immediately sound suspicious, but the fact that it's loading several .NET components might indicate some custom or potentially malicious behavior.\n\nThe later events show PowerShell.exe being executed with command lines that include importing a module from C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. The path seems constructed in a way that could be trying to hide it, like using \"..\" which suggests it's going up a directory level. Also, the script is attempting to execute some commands with error handling to exit if something fails, and there's a sleep command at the end.\n\nOne event shows an attempt to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to tarefa_logico.exe as its binary path. Services are often used by malware to persist across reboots because they start automatically on boot. So creating a new service could be part of installing a backdoor or persistence mechanism.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell activities with potentially malicious scripts, file operations in temp directories, attempts to create services, and the use of obfuscated paths. These are all red flags for possible malicious behavior. The combination of these events suggests that an attacker might be deploying some form of malware using PowerShell as a weaponized tool.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities, including file creation\/deletion in temp directories and attempts to create a new service.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where PowerShell is being used to create and start a service. The command line shows the creation of a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path. This could be concerning because creating services can be a way for attackers to maintain persistence on a system.\n\nThen, there's another set of events where a remote command is being executed multiple times. All these commands point to the same file: 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The repeated execution of the same script might indicate malicious activity, as attackers often run scripts multiple times to ensure they work or to deploy further components.\n\nLooking at the process field, some events show \"services.exe\", which is a legitimate Windows process. However, when combined with the creation of a new service and the remote command executions, it raises suspicion because services can be misused for persistence.\n\nI also see that many events have no file or process information, which might suggest attempts to hide activity or log clearing, but in this case, they're just not present, so it's harder to say. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several red flags: PowerShell creating a service with an unusual name and binary path, repeated remote command executions of a specific script, and legitimate processes being involved. These could be indicators of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some events on their own might not be alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of remote command execution and service creation with unusual paths suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each line is a JSON object representing an event. There are three events here, all identical. Each one has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the \"process\" field, it's set to \"None\". That's unusual because typically, this field would indicate which process triggered the event. If it's None, maybe the event wasn't associated with any running process, or perhaps there was an issue capturing that information.\n\nNext, the \"winlog\" key contains a dictionary with the task being \"Execute a Remote Command\". This suggests that someone is executing commands over a remote session. While this can be legitimate in some cases, especially in networked environments where remote access tools are used, it could also indicate malicious activity like remote code execution or command-and-control communication.\n\nThe \"file\" field has a path pointing to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The presence of a PowerShell script is notable because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and for executing malicious commands. The file path itself seems to be in Portuguese, which translates to something like \"Logical Unit\", \"Secondary Record\", and \"Auxiliary Component\". This might not immediately raise red flags, but the combination with the remote command execution task makes me cautious.\n\nConsidering all three events are identical, it's possible that they're part of a repeated attempt or multiple instances of the same activity. If this script is executing remotely multiple times, it could be indicative of an automated attack, such as a script being run in a loop or part of a larger campaign.\n\nI'm also thinking about potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). The remote command execution without a legitimate process context and the use of a PowerShell script are both red flags. Additionally, if this activity is occurring outside normal business hours or in an unusual pattern, it would increase suspicion. However, since I don't have that temporal data here, I'll focus on what's provided.\n\nAnother angle is whether this script is known for malicious purposes. If \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" isn't a commonly used script and hasn't been seen before in the environment, that raises concerns. It might be custom malware designed to avoid detection.\n\nThe fact that there are three identical events could suggest persistence attempts—multiple tries to ensure the command runs successfully. This is common in attacks where an adversary wants to establish a foothold or maintain access despite potential disruptions.\n\nIn summary, while individual instances of remote command execution can sometimes be benign, the repetition and the use of PowerShell without a clear process context make this batch interesting for further investigation. There's a high probability that these events are related to malicious activity, hence my classification.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events show repeated remote command execution with no associated process and use of a PowerShell script, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
