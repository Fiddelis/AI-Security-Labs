{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first JSON object:\n- The process name is 'chrome.exe'. That's pretty common and usually not suspicious on its own.\n- The Windows log task is 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)', which means Chrome has loaded an image or a DLL. The file path mentioned is 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll'. Hmm, that's the Windows Defender directory, so this seems legitimate since MpOAV stands for Microsoft Protection and Antivirus.\n\nNext, the second JSON object:\n- Again, it's 'chrome.exe' as the process.\n- The task is 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. So Chrome is modifying a registry key. This can be normal since applications often interact with the registry, but I should keep an eye on what specific registry entries are being changed.\n\nNow, the third JSON object:\n- The process here is 'winlogbeat.exe', which is likely an agent used for collecting Windows logs, maybe something like Elastic's winlogbeat. That makes sense in a logging setup.\n- The task is 'File created (rule: FileCreate)', and the file path is within a user directory ('C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...'). It looks like it's creating a configuration file (.winlogbeat.yml.new). This seems normal as part of setting up log collection.\n\nPutting it all together, each event on its own isn't alarming. Chrome loading legitimate DLLs and registry changes are standard. The winlogbeat creating files is expected behavior for log management. There's no indication of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or other red flags like writes to unexpected locations or process anomalies.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity across the batch. All events seem related to normal operations: loading necessary libraries, registry modifications by a browser, and file creation by a log agent. Without more context or additional suspicious attributes, there's no cause for concern here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve normal system processes such as loading legitimate DLLs, registry modifications by Chrome.exe, and file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which are typical activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is about 'tarefa_base.exe' loading a DLL file from the .NET Framework directory. That seems normal because executables often load DLLs for functionality, especially in Microsoft's framework.\n\nNext, there's an entry for 'elemento_ativo.exe' being terminated. Processes get terminated all the time by Windows or other applications, so that doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nThen, I see multiple entries where various processes like 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', and others are setting registry values. Registry writes can be part of normal operations, especially for configuration purposes, but too many in a short time could be suspicious. However, each of these events individually doesn't seem out of the ordinary.\n\nThere's an entry for 'powershell.exe' being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used both by admins and attackers, so this might be worth looking into, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nLooking further down, I notice multiple entries from 'svchost.exe' writing to the registry. Since svchost is a common process that hosts various services, its activity alone isn't concerning unless it's doing something unusual.\n\nThere are events where 'calc.exe', 'Calculator.exe', and other standard apps are loading DLLs or accessing resources. These processes are expected to interact with system libraries like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, which handle URL parsing and anti-malware scanning respectively. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nI also see entries from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files. This seems related to log management, possibly from an agent installed on the system. If it's doing file creation as part of its normal operation, that's expected.\n\nMultiple instances where 'chrome.exe' is setting registry values. Browsers often interact with the registry for settings and extensions, so this is likely normal unless there's a pattern indicating tampering.\n\nPutting all these together: most events are standard system operations. The only thing that stands out is the number of registry writes from various processes, including non-standard ones like 'elemento_ativo.exe'. However, without evidence of failed access attempts or other anomalies, it's hard to classify this batch as malicious. \n\nTherefore, after analyzing all the events, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because none of the individual actions indicate malicious behavior when considered together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly standard system operations without signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the events one by one to understand what's happening. The first few events are from chrome.exe with network connections detected. That seems normal because Chrome often makes network requests as part of its operation, especially for loading web pages or extensions.\n\nThen there are a couple of powershell.exe entries. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be a vector for attacks. The tasks here are 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set.' Hmm, those actions could be benign, but they might also indicate malicious activity. For example, accessing processes or modifying the registry without clear justification could be suspicious.\n\nNext up is whoami.exe being executed. That's typically used to display user information. It's a standard tool, so unless it's part of a larger sequence of actions, I don't think that's immediately concerning on its own.\n\nThen there are cmd.exe processes with command lines that look like they're compiling C# code into executables using csc.exe. The command lines seem to be generating files in temporary directories. This could be legitimate if it's part of a development environment or script execution, but it can also be a sign of malicious activity where an attacker is compiling custom malware on the fly.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of processes creating new executables (like tarefa_auxiliar.exe and unidade_padrao.exe) which might not have clear origins. The fact that these files are being created in temporary directories could mean they're part of a legitimate process, like building software or running scripts, but it's also risky because attackers often use such steps to drop malicious payloads.\n\nOther events involve loading various .NET framework components and registry modifications by RuntimeBroker.exe. These don't immediately raise red flags, as they are common for applications that run on the .NET framework.\n\nPutting all these together, I'm noticing a pattern where multiple processes are being created, network connections are established, and files are being written to temporary directories. This could indicate a script or application performing legitimate tasks, but it's also consistent with some attack behaviors like code injection, process spawning, and file creation as part of a malicious payload deployment.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.7 because while there are several red flags (use of PowerShell, multiple processes creating files), the context isn't fully clear. Without additional information about the user's activity or the system's usual behavior, it's hard to be certain if these events are truly malicious. However, given the combination of tools and actions, it's more than just routine activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple process creations, network connections, file operations, and registry modifications involving potentially malicious activities like PowerShell usage and suspicious executable generation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
