I see that most of the entries are from Chrome.exe setting registry values, which is normal for browser updates or settings changes. There's also a Dns query from Chrome and some file creation events.\n\nLooking closer, one event is winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which is expected since it's part of the logging setup. Then there's PowerShell creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, it's also often associated with malicious activities like script execution or lateral movement.\n\nI'm concerned about the frequency of Chrome registry changes—eight events in a row. That might indicate some automated process or potential tampering. The combination of multiple registry writes and the creation of an object file via PowerShell raises flags. Although each event on its own isn't suspicious, together they could suggest malicious behavior, such as persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nThe justification is that these events, especially the PowerShell activity, might be part of a larger attack vector. My confidence level is around 0.7 because while it's not conclusive, the pattern does warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values and powershell.exe creating a file, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, several entries show PowerShell.exe loading images and creating files. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The creation of a temporary file named with random characters could be a red flag—it might be part of script execution or testing permissions.\n\nThen there's an event where a scheduled task is being created using PowerShell. The command line shows that it's setting up a task to run calc.exe at logon, which seems unusual. Usually, legitimate scripts wouldn't use such specific commands unless they're trying to hide malicious activity. The fact that the task name includes \"estrutura_auxiliar\" doesn't ring any bells as a common term, so I'm suspicious.\n\nI also notice multiple registry writes from chrome.exe. While Chrome does make changes to the registry for extensions and settings, the frequency here is high—seven events. That might be normal if it's installing or updating extensions, but sometimes attackers use legitimate processes like Chrome to hide their activities, making detection harder.\n\nFinally, there are several \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process or file information. This is concerning because remote command executions can indicate unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network. Without more context, it's hard to say if these are part of normal operations or an attack.\n\nPutting it all together: PowerShell creating scheduled tasks, writing files to temp directories, and the high number of registry writes from Chrome, along with multiple remote command executions, suggest possible malicious activity. The combination of these events makes the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains several indicators of potential malicious activity, including PowerShell process creation with suspicious command lines, file operations in temporary directories, and multiple remote command executions. These activities could indicate script testing or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That's a bit concerning because remote commands can be used maliciously, but without more context, it's hard to say. They might just be legitimate remote operations.\n\nThen, I see an event with process details involving powershell.exe executing a scheduled task action to run calc.exe at logon. This is tricky because while using PowerShell for system tasks is common, the fact that it's setting up a scheduled task to run calc.exe on startup could indicate persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nLooking further, there are several events related to svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files in Task directory. Svchost.exe is often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The fact that it's making changes to the registry and file system might suggest some malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll, which could be normal for Windows Management Instrumentation, but again, without more context, it's hard to assess.\n\nThere are also entries from processes like chrome.exe and conhost.exe accessing various files and registry keys. These seem more benign unless they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nOne event stands out where powershell.exe creates a file in the user's AppData directory, which is sometimes used for storing malicious configurations or scripts. Additionally, there are multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe, which could be setting up persistence points or altering system behavior in ways that aren't easily detectable.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks, svchost.exe modifying registry and file system, and other unusual process activities raises flags for potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to execute remote commands and the specific actions taken by these processes suggest a possible attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activity, such as scheduled task creation with calc.exe, registry modifications, and file operations which may indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The command lines look suspicious—each one has a PowerShell script that creates scheduled tasks using Register-ScheduledTask. The task actions are set to execute calc.exe at logon, which seems unusual. Why would they want to run calc.exe on startup? That doesn't make much sense unless it's a test or something malicious.\n\nLooking closer, the scheduled tasks have names like 'unidade_ativo', 'tarefa_base', etc., which don't ring any bells as standard system processes. The principals are set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with run level highest, meaning they have high privileges. That's another red flag because malware often uses high privileges to maintain persistence and control.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes (ProcessAccess) and modifies registry values (RegistryEvent). These activities can be indicators of malicious behavior, like trying to hide processes or inject code into them. Also, there's an event where powershell.exe loads mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are part of the .NET framework but sometimes used by malware for execution.\n\nOther events show chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying registry values. While chrome can be legitimate, unexpected pipe creations and registry changes might indicate some form of injection or communication with other processes, which could be malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe to create scheduled tasks with high privileges and unusual task names suggests possible persistence mechanisms. The combination of process access, registry modifications, and loading .NET components adds to the suspicion. Although there are some legitimate activities like chrome's pipe creation, the overall pattern of powershell.exe behavior is concerning.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these events are part of a coordinated attack or just testing, but the indicators point towards potential malicious activity. The confidence level isn't 100% because without more context, it's hard to confirm. But based on standard security practices and known TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures), this batch should be looked into further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action, high privileges, and unusual task names.
