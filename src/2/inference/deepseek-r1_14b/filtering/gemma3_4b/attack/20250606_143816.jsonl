Let me go through each one to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe accessed something. Not too bad on its own since it's a common tool.\n\nSecond is whoami.exe running. That's usually for checking user info, not malicious unless misused.\n\nThird again powershell.exe access, same as before.\n\nFourth, another powershell.exe accessing the registry. Hmm, might be normal but could indicate something more if combined with other events.\n\nFifth event catches my eye. Powershell is being executed with a command line that includes downloading a script from GitHub. The URL looks suspicious because it's a raw.githubusercontent.com link which can host malicious scripts. Also, the script name WinPwn.ps1 sounds concerning. This could be part of an attack or persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, which is normal but in combination with the earlier download, raises suspicion about loaded modules or malicious code execution.\n\nFile creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1) is another red flag. Creating and deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection or execute malicious scripts temporarily.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could be for communication between processes, possibly for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the rest, some are normal operations like loading system DLLs or defender components. The last event is sppsvc.exe accessing taskschd.dll, which might be related to scheduling but not necessarily malicious unless part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances, downloading an external script, creating\/deleting temp files, registry access, and pipes.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n1. svchost.exe setting a registry value.\n2. sppsvc.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache\\cache.dat. That seems normal as it's part of system updates or activation.\n3. powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag.\n4. whoami.exe running. This is usually harmless unless it's part of privilege escalation.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. Notably, there's a process create event for PowerShell with a command line that tries to connect to \\\\Target\\C$. That looks suspicious because it might indicate an attempt to access another machine, possibly over the network. This could be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nSeveral FileCreate events by powershell.exe, including creating and then deleting a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1). Creating temporary files is common for scripts, but combined with other actions, it might suggest malicious activity like persistence or dropping malware components.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad tasks in PowerShell are normal as scripts load various .NET libraries. However, the combination of these events with others could indicate something more serious.\n\nThe FileDeleteDetected event suggests that a file was deleted after being created, which is often a tactic to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nLastly, there's a Pipe Created event by PowerShell. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, potentially for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe with suspicious commands, file operations, registry modifications, and network attempts (like connecting to \\\\Target\\C$) strongly suggests malicious behavior. These activities are common indicators of potential ransomware, malware execution, or attack lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes accessing system resources and attempting network connections, indicative of possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, meaning each line is a separate JSON object. The task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all seem similar. The 'process' field shows that PowerShell is being executed with a command line argument. Specifically, it's downloading a script from GitHub and executing it. That immediately raises red flags because downloading scripts from random sites can be malicious. The script in question is from 'WinPwn.ps1', which I recall hearing about before—it's known for persistence and lateral movement techniques.\n\nI also notice that the same command repeats multiple times, which might indicate an attempt to run this script several times, possibly as part of a larger attack. Each event has 'powershell.exe' in the process command line, and some variations where they're creating a new PS drive with '\\\\Target\\\\C$'. This is another suspicious activity because it's trying to map a drive to a remote system, which could be part of an attempt to access other machines on the network.\n\nThe 'winlog' field shows tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are legitimate Windows events, but combined with the PowerShell commands, they might suggest something is wrong. Normally, these logs would be about system services starting or stopping, but here they're paired with potentially malicious script executions.\n\nAnother point of concern is that all these events have \"file\": \"None\". This makes me think the logs aren't capturing file-related activities, which could mean either there's nothing to log or that the attack is designed to avoid detection by not writing files in a conventional way—maybe using memory-only operations instead.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of downloading and executing scripts from a known malicious repository, repeated attempts to map drives to remote systems, and events that don't involve file writes. This could indicate an active attack where the attacker is trying to establish persistence or move laterally within a network without leaving obvious traces on disk.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as 'interesting' because it shows signs of potential malicious activity, especially with repeated attempts and use of known exploit scripts.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits multiple indicators of potential malicious activity. The repeated execution of PowerShell commands downloading and running scripts from a known malicious repository, combined with efforts to map remote drives, suggests possible attack vectors such as persistence or lateral movement within a network. Additionally, the lack of file writes in logs might indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:** The 'process' field shows repeated use of `powershell.exe` with command lines downloading scripts from GitHub (`WinPwn.ps1`) and attempting remote drive mappings.\n2. **Analyze Script Source:** `WinPwn.ps1` is associated with malicious activities, indicating a potential threat.\n3. **Look for Patterns:** The same commands repeat multiple times, suggesting an ongoing or repeated attempt at executing the script.\n4. **Examine Event Contexts:** 'winlog' tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' paired with these PowerShell commands could signal system service manipulation as part of an attack.\n5. **Check File Writes:** All events have \"file\": \"None\", possibly indicating file-less operations to evade detection.\n6. **Assess Indicators Collectively:** The combination points towards potential malicious intent, such as establishing persistence or lateral movement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch is classified as 'interesting' due to the presence of multiple suspicious activities indicative of a possible cyberattack."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The values under process and file are \"None\", which means there's no associated process or file information for these events. The winlog key contains a dictionary where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\".\n\nHmm, executing remote commands can be legitimate or malicious. It depends on the context. Since all these events have the same task in winlog, it suggests repetitive behavior. I need to consider whether this is normal or unusual for the system.\n\nIf this activity is happening frequently, it might indicate something suspicious, especially if there's no variation in the commands being executed. However, without additional information like user context, timestamps, or specific command details, it's hard to determine malicious intent. Maybe the system regularly runs remote tasks as part of its operations.\n\nOn the other hand, multiple identical events could be a sign of scripting or automation, which might not necessarily be bad but could warrant closer monitoring. Since all events are the same and there's no extra data, my confidence in classifying them as interesting isn't very high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events with no additional context or variation suggest normal behavior rather than malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}\n```"}
