There are a lot of entries here, all related to svchost.exe which is known for being part of legitimate Windows services but can also be used by malware.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that most of the events are Registry value sets. This could indicate some configuration changes, which might not be suspicious on their own, especially since svchost.exe handles many system functions.\n\nHowever, there are a few FileCreate tasks. The files created include logs and updates in locations like C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution, which is associated with Windows Update services. But one file path is unusual: \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Logs\\\\waasmedic\\\\...\" and another under \"Download\" with a hash-like name. This could be suspicious because it's creating files in non-standard directories outside the usual system folders.\n\nConsidering svchost.exe activities along with file creation in these paths might suggest potential malicious behavior, like persistence or data exfiltration. The combination of multiple registry changes and file operations could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or create temporary files for malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Registry value set events from svchost.exe and creation of unusual files, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where different processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe are setting registry values. These tasks seem normal because many system processes interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nThen, I see that powershell.exe is involved in creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That could be suspicious, but sometimes PowerShell is used legitimately by scripts or admins, so it might not be malicious on its own.\n\nA lot of the entries are from svchost.exe, which is a common process for services in Windows. The tasks include file creations and image loads within standard system directories like System32 and SoftwareDistribution. These actions don't raise red flags because svchost is known to handle various services.\n\nSome files being created under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download look suspicious at first glance, but looking closer, they have names like UpdateAgent.dll and Mitigation.dll, which are typical components for Windows updates or system integrity. The paths also align with standard update processes, so this doesn't seem unusual.\n\nThe image loads of urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll by svchost.exe and other processes are normal as these are part of URL handling and background services in Windows.\n\nSince all the events fall within expected activities for system processes and don't indicate any overtly malicious behavior like access to user files, unusual registry modifications, or known malicious file hashes, I don't see a strong reason to flag this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing standard operations such as registry updates and file creation in expected locations.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe accessing different resources and performing actions like file creation and deletion. Powershell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be a vector for malicious activity. The repeated ProcessAccess events might indicate exploration or unauthorized access.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one of the powershell.exe instances runs a script from C:\\unidade_logico\\... which translates to 'logical unit' in Portuguese, suggesting it's not a standard path. The script tries to execute Invoke-entrada_principal and exits on error. This could be an attempt to run malicious code.\n\nThe file creation and deletion events are concerning because they show the script creating a temporary .ps1 file and then deleting it shortly after. Such behavior is often seen in attempts to bypass detection mechanisms, like creating a footprint and then removing evidence quickly.\n\nThere's also activity involving svchost.exe accessing registry values and creating files. Svchost is typically used by legitimate services, but unusual activities can indicate malware. The FileCreate event for edbtmp.log might be part of an update process or logging, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe numerous ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs could be normal script execution, but combined with other suspicious actions, it raises flags.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated powershell.exe activities with specific command lines and file operations, along with the svchost.exe behavior, suggest potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because multiple indicators point towards possible compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell execution with suspicious command-line arguments, including attempts to run a script from an unusual path and file operations that may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common system process, but sometimes malware can hide under that name. But the action here is just a registry value set—could be normal or malicious. I'll keep an eye out for more events related to this.\n\nNext, another svchost event where it's creating a file in C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install. That path seems a bit off because SoftwareDistribution is usually part of Windows Update. Creating files there might not be standard unless it's during updates. But the fact that multiple files are being created by svchost could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, svchost creates an executable file named AM_Delta_Patch...exe in that directory. Delta patches are often used for software updates, but again, if this is happening outside of a normal update cycle, it might indicate something's wrong.\n\nThen there are several events from MpSigStub.exe. That's related to Windows Defender. It's loading some DLLs and creating files in the Temp directory with long GUID-like names. The filenames include things like mpasdlta.vdm._p and mpavdlta.vdm._p, which seem like parts of update packages. This could be normal for Defender updates, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAfter that, setup.exe is creating multiple files in the EdgeCore directory. These include .exe files like cookie_exporter.exe and identity_helper.exe. EdgeCore is part of Microsoft Edge, so these might be legitimate components being installed or updated. But having multiple exe files created by setup.exe could indicate an installation process—maybe a new software version is being rolled out.\n\nThere's also RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is involved in managing user runtime accounts and packages, so that seems normal unless there are other signs of compromise.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe accessed a process. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers, but not all uses are malicious. It could be legitimate admin activity or something else.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows processes related to Windows services (svchost, MpSigStub, MsMpEng) creating files in standard directories like SoftwareDistribution and Temp, which could be part of normal system operations. Additionally, setup.exe is installing components for Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate activity during updates or installations.\n\nHowever, the creation of executable files by svchost.exe outside expected paths, especially in the Download directory, might be concerning. Also, multiple file creations by MpSigStub and setup.exe could indicate update processes gone wrong or malicious activities trying to blend in with normal traffic.\n\nI'm leaning towards INTERESTING because while some events are normal, others raise flags that need further investigation. The confidence isn't super high (maybe 0.6) because I'm not sure if all these actions are definitively malicious, but they do warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by svchost.exe and MpSigStub.exe in unusual paths, potential indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event is whoami.exe being executed. That's a common command used for user identification, usually not malicious on its own. But it's worth noting since it's an executable.\n\nNext, there are multiple powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious because of its scripting capabilities. The second event shows that powershell accessed some process, which could mean script execution or other actions.\n\nLooking further, in the fourth event, there's a command line with a powershell script creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an exe file path. This seems suspicious. Creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, especially if the binary path is unusual or obfuscated.\n\nThe events following that show powershell accessing various files and registry values. There are multiple ImageLoad tasks, which means it's loading different DLLs—normal for powershell scripts but could also indicate malicious activity if the loaded modules are from unexpected locations.\n\nThere's a file created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script name. Then immediately after that, the same file is deleted. This pattern is known to be used by attackers to bypass script execution policies or test if they can run scripts without being detected. The deletion might prevent logging or analysis of the script content.\n\nAnother event shows a pipe created by powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, which in itself isn't suspicious, but combined with other actions could be part of a larger malicious routine.\n\nThe services.exe process is setting registry values multiple times. Services.exe is legitimate, but frequent changes could indicate tampering, especially if the changes are to non-standard areas or involve creating new services.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe running scripts that create and delete files quickly in Temp, creating a service with an unusual name pointing to a specific exe, accessing various system components like registry and images, and repeated attempts to write to the registry. These actions collectively suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence or executing arbitrary code.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the combination of suspicious activities, especially the script creation\/deletion and service creation with a potentially malicious payload.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes creating a service, accessing registry values repeatedly, loading various DLLs, and executing scripts that are quickly deleted.

That seems normal because those are common system processes and their associated DLLs. No red flags there.\n\nNext, there's a file creation event from powershell.exe in the user's AppData directory. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. This could be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, I need to look at all events together.\n\nThen, there are several entries where the process is null, but the task involves executing a remote command. The file paths point to PowerShell scripts in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\...\" which might be a custom or potentially malicious script location. This could indicate some automated or remote execution activity.\n\nLooking further, multiple events show powershell.exe with complex command lines importing modules from those same directories and invoking commands like Invoke-entrada_principal. Repeating the exact same command line in several entries suggests this is part of a script that's running multiple times, possibly to avoid detection or to perform some task at intervals.\n\nThe tasks are labeled as 'Execute a Remote Command' and involve specific file paths. This combination raises concerns about remote code execution or potential lateral movement within a network. The use of Invoke-entrada_principal isn't a standard cmdlet, which makes me think it's part of a custom script, possibly malicious.\n\nAlso, the scripts are being executed from an unusual location (C:\\unidade_logico\\...) and saving output to Temp. This could be a way to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell with custom scripts from non-standard locations, combined with remote command execution tasks, indicates potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing the same script ( Invoke-entrada_principal ) from a non-standard location and saving output to Temp directory suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events provided. Let me try to parse through them one by one and see if I can spot any patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, the initial 9 events all have a similar structure: they're PowerShell commands creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path. The command line shows `New-Service` and `Start-Service` being executed, which is common for setting up services in Windows. However, I'm noticing that the task in winlog cycles between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. This makes me think these might be related to service creation and starting events, which are standard when a new service is installed or started.\n\nBut then, after those 9 entries, there's another set of events (from line 10 onwards) where the process command line is None. Instead, the winlog task changes to 'Execute a Remote Command', and there's a file path pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1`. This seems a bit suspicious because it indicates that some script is being executed remotely.\n\nThe fact that multiple events are showing remote command execution with the same PowerShell script path raises an eyebrow. Malware often uses such techniques to execute malicious scripts without being detected easily. Also, the presence of two different file paths—once in the process and then in the file field later on—could indicate attempts to hide or change how the commands are executed.\n\nI'm also considering whether these events could be part of normal system operations. However, multiple remote command executions in a row with the same script might not be typical unless there's an automated process running scripts regularly, which is less common. Moreover, the initial PowerShell commands creating services could be setting up persistence mechanisms or installing backdoors.\n\nAnother point to note is that some events have the process field as None and only show file information. This makes me think that the remote command execution might not involve a visible process but directly executes a script, which can sometimes bypass certain security measures.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple signs of potentially malicious activity: repeated remote command executions with the same script, creation of new services via PowerShell, and some discrepancies in how processes are logged. However, I can't be entirely certain without more context or deeper analysis.\n\nI would rate my confidence around 0.85 on a scale from 0 to 1 because while there are red flags, they could potentially be legitimate activities depending on the system's normal operations. To increase confidence, further investigation into whether these scripts and services are authorized or part of known processes would be necessary.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of remote command execution with the same script path and creation of a new service via PowerShell suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The user provided 24 JSONL entries, each with process, winlog, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events are similar. Specifically, 23 out of the 24 entries have a 'winlog' task of 'Execute a Remote Command' and the same file path pointing to 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. This repetition stands out because it suggests a pattern or routine activity rather than random events.\n\nLooking at the other entries, one has a process named 'services.exe' with a logon task, and another is a 'Special Logon' without any file. These could be legitimate system processes, but they're in the minority here.\n\nThe repeated execution of the same remote command on the same file path might indicate script or batch processing. However, considering the high frequency (23 times), it's unusual unless this script runs frequently as part of normal operations. Without knowing the baseline, I can't be sure if this is normal behavior.\n\nBut considering potential malicious activities, repeated attempts to execute a remote command on the same file could indicate scripting or automated attacks attempting to gain access or exfiltrate data. However, without additional context like timestamps showing rapid succession or other anomalies (e.g., failed logons), it's hard to definitively classify this as malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, if these events are part of a legitimate script running periodically, they might not be suspicious at all. The lack of variation in file paths and tasks makes me lean towards 'NOT INTERESTING' unless there are more red flags.\n\nSo, weighing the information, I'm 75% confident that this batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation because the repeated events don't necessarily indicate malicious activity without further context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple entries show repeated execution of a remote command on the same file path, potentially indicating suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with three fields: process, winlog, and file. The entries seem repetitive, so let me break down what each field contains.\n\nThe 'process' field is consistently \"None\" in all events, which might mean that there's no associated process information captured for these events. That could be normal or it could indicate something missing, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, most entries have a task of either \"Execute a Remote Command\" or \"Windows Update Agent\". The latter seems related to legitimate Windows update activities, which are usually benign. However, the former, \"Execute a Remote Command\", sounds more suspicious because it could be indicative of remote execution commands often used in attacks.\n\nThe 'file' field has paths pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This path looks like it's using a mix of Portuguese and English folder names, which is unusual. The presence of a .ps1 file suggests PowerShell scripting, which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, especially in the context of remote commands.\n\nI notice that there are multiple events with identical file paths and winlog tasks. Specifically, 14 events have \"Execute a Remote Command\" and one has \"Windows Update Agent\". The repetition might indicate an automated process or something more nefarious like a script running multiple times or being triggered in a loop.\n\nSince all these events involve executing remote commands through PowerShell scripts located at the same path, it's concerning. Malware often uses such techniques to maintain persistence or carry out attacks. However, I should consider if this is part of normal system operations for that particular environment. If legitimate use cases exist where such scripts are run frequently, then maybe it's not suspicious.\n\nBut without knowing the baseline of normal activity for this system, multiple identical remote command executions could be red flags. Additionally, the file path seems non-standard, which raises questions about whether it's part of a legitimate software package or something introduced maliciously.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are enough indicators that could point to malicious activity, even though some aspects might be explainable by normal operations. My confidence is around 0.7 because while the signs are concerning, they aren't definitive proof of an attack without further context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show remote command execution attempts targeting a suspicious PowerShell script, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
