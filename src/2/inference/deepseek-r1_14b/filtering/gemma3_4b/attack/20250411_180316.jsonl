{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation purposes. The classification should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **RuntimeBroker.exe** set a registry value. Runtime Broker is related to user accounts and might be legitimate.\n2. **Notepad.exe** also set a registry value. Notepad isn't typically malicious, but unusual registry changes could indicate something.\n3. **Powershell.exe** accessed some process. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, so this catches my attention.\n4. **Calc.exe** loaded urlmon.dll, which is a known Windows component, so that seems normal.\n5. **Svchost.exe** set another registry value. Svchost can be tricky since it's a legitimate process but can be used maliciously.\n6. Another instance of **svchost.exe** doing the same thing again.\n7. **Calculator.exe** loaded urlmon.dll as well, which again is normal.\n8. Another **svchost.exe** with another registry set.\n9. **Winlogbeat.exe** created a file, probably part of log shipping, so this seems benign.\n10. Another **Powershell.exe** process access.\n11. **Whoami.exe** was executed with its default command line; not suspicious unless used in a sequence.\n12. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe** set registry value; legitimate but could be abused.\n13. **Calculator.exe** again setting registry, which might be unusual for a calculator.\n14. **Powershell.exe** process access again.\n15. **Chrome.exe** created a pipe and set registry. Chrome processes are common and such events are usually not malicious unless part of C2.\n16. Another **cmd.exe** with a command line deleting Notepad.exe if it exists. This is interesting because cmd.exe can execute arbitrary commands, especially when combined with deletion commands.\n17. **WMIC.exe** created a process to delete Notepad.exe and loaded some DLLs. WMIC is often used in attacks for remote command execution. Deleting processes could be part of persistence or cleanup.\n\nPutting it all together, I notice several red flags:\n\n- Multiple instances of Powershell.exe accessing processes. Even though Powershell can be legitimate, the frequency might indicate something suspicious.\n- The cmd.exe and wmic.exe commands are explicitly deleting Notepad.exe. This is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity because attackers often delete evidence or competing processes.\n- The use of WMIC for process creation could be part of command and control (C2) activities since WMIC can execute remote commands.\n- Registry modifications by various processes, including svchost.exe, which is commonly used in malware.\n\nThe cmd and wmic commands stand out because they're directly deleting Notepad.exe. If Notepad was running or being used maliciously, this could be an attempt to remove it. Alternatively, if the system has legitimate uses of Notepad, this deletion might not be expected and could indicate an attacker trying to clean up traces.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests possible malicious activities such as process termination (cmd\/wmic), registry manipulation for persistence or configuration changes, and the use of powerful tools like Powershell and WMIC. While individual events might seem benign, together they create a concerning pattern that warrants investigation.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence because the activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including Powershell process access, deletion of processes via cmd.exe and WMIC.exe, and registry modifications which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a process named \"WMIC.exe\" loading the file \"MpOAV.dll\". WMIC is known for being used in some malicious activities because it can execute commands remotely. The MpOAV.dll sounds like part of Windows Defender, but sometimes attackers might try to replace legitimate files or use them as a vector. So that's a bit concerning.\n\nThen I see multiple entries where different processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, and conhost.exe are setting registry values. Registry writes can be normal for some applications, but they could also indicate malicious activity trying to persistence or modify system settings. The repetition of these events across various processes might suggest a pattern worth looking into.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and used. PowerShell is powerful and often abused by attackers for execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's accessing different processes and modifying the registry could be signs of privilege escalation or creating backdoors.\n\nThere's a command in cmd.exe: \"\/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". This looks like an attempt to replace the default system binary with another one, which is suspicious because it could be dropping malicious software. Replacing such files can lead to persistence or enabling non-privileged users to gain higher access.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command: \"\/c schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". This is deleting a scheduled task named \"win32times\". Attackers often delete tasks to cover their tracks or remove competing malware. It's a common tactic in an attack chain, so this adds to the concern.\n\nLastly, there's a process for schtasks.exe being used with the same command as cmd.exe, which might indicate an attempt to manage scheduled tasks, possibly to create new ones or alter existing ones for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show multiple signs of potential malicious activities: using WMIC for possible remote execution, modifying the registry across various processes, abusing PowerShell for access and changes, replacing system binaries, deleting scheduled tasks, and using schtasks.exe. All these points suggest a coordinated attack where an attacker is attempting to gain persistence, escalate privileges, and possibly cover their tracks.\n\nI'm fairly confident that this batch indicates malicious behavior because it combines several red flags across different process types and commands. The combination of file operations, registry modifications, and PowerShell usage is typical in attack scenarios. So the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, such as suspicious file operations, registry modifications, and the use of tools commonly associated with attacks like WMIC.exe, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format with three main components: process, winlog, and file. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **schtasks.exe**: This is theScheduled Task command-line tool. It's often used for scheduling tasks. The log mentions an image load for taskschd.dll, which seems normal since schtasks relies on this DLL.\n\n2. **svchost.exe**: This is a generic host process for services. Seeing it interact with the registry is common and usually not suspicious unless combined with other activities.\n\n3. **cmd.exe** appears multiple times. One instance has a command line \"\/c\", which means it's executing a single command and then terminating. cmd being used isn't unusual on its own, but if it's part of malicious activity, like running scripts or commands that shouldn't be there, it could be bad.\n\n4. **conhost.exe**: This is typically related to console windows. Its interaction with the registry might be standard for certain operations, but again, multiple instances can raise an eyebrow.\n\n5. **powershell.exe** shows up several times. PowerShell is a powerful tool that's often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. Each time it accesses processes or sets registry values could be part of malicious activity.\n\n6. **whoami.exe**: This is a simple utility to display user information. The command line here seems straightforward, but if it's being run in conjunction with other tools, especially after hours or without proper justification, it might indicate privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the logs, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing processes and modifying registry values. These actions can be part of legitimate administration tasks, but they're also common in attack chainsâ€”like creating persistence points or lateral movement. The fact that cmd.exe is being used with \"\/c\" suggests it might be executing commands that could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of conhost.exe and cmd.exe without clear justification. This repetition could indicate automated activity or scripts running multiple times, which isn't always suspicious but does warrant closer inspection.\n\nI'm also noting that schtasks.exe was used, which can be a red flag if it's creating or modifying tasks without proper authorization. The file path for taskschd.dll seems legitimate, but combined with other events, it might suggest configuration changes to scheduled tasks that could be malicious.\n\nOverall, while individual events aren't necessarily suspicious, the combination of multiple PowerShell accesses, cmd executions, and registry modifications across several processes raises concerns about potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is using these tools to execute commands, create persistence mechanisms, or move laterally within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities such as repeated use of PowerShell, cmd.exe with '\/c' command line, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Let me try to parse through each one to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal as it's a common utility. Then, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with various tasks like Process Create, Registry access, and image loading. Powershell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities, so repeated instances could be concerning.\n\nLooking at the file events, I see that powershell.exe created a temporary .ps1 script in the AppData folder. Then it deleted that same script shortly after. This behavior might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code and then remove evidence. Also, the file creation of winlogbeat.exe's config file doesn't seem suspicious by itself.\n\nThe events about provider lifecycle and engine lifecycle for powershell.exe could be normal, but combined with other activities like registry changes and temporary file handling, it raises flags. Malicious actors often use these techniques to maintain persistence or execute attacks without being detected easily.\n\nSo, considering the overall batch, there are several red flags: multiple powershell instances, registry modifications, creation\/deletion of temp scripts, which could all point towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities including file creation and deletion in temporary directories, registry changes, and repeated process creations, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, so it's definitely something to keep an eye on. The fact that it appears multiple times in the logs could be significant.\n\nLooking at the first event: `powershell.exe` loaded a file from `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender...`. This path seems legitimate because Windows Defender is a standard Microsoft application. So, this might not raise any red flags immediately.\n\nNext, another event shows that `powershell.exe` created a file in the user's AppData folder: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\...\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`. The fact that it's creating a profile data file might be part of normal operation, but I should check what this specific file is used for.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell accesses processes and sets registry values. These actions alone aren't malicious, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also see an event involving `conhost.exe`. This is a Windows process that's often innocent, but sometimes malware can abuse legitimate tools. I'll keep this in mind, though without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nLooking further down, there are several events where PowerShell is called with specific command lines. These commands check for the existence of certain files with paths like `C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat`. The file names have patterns suggesting they might be scripts used for malicious purposes, possibly as part of a larger script execution or persistence mechanism.\n\nEach command line in these events has an `if (Test-Path ...) {exit 0} else {exit 1}` structure. This is a common pattern in scripts to check if a specific file exists. If the file doesn't exist, it exits with code 1; otherwise, it proceeds. Malware often uses such checks to execute other parts of the script or to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the repetition of similar command lines across multiple events. This could indicate automated or batch processing, possibly part of a script execution loop. Such behavior might be used by attackers to run malicious scripts at regular intervals or during specific conditions.\n\nThere are also entries where the file path points to various `.bat` files in different directories. The paths seem constructed with purposeful folder names like `modulo_geral`, `registro_auxiliar`, etc., which don't immediately ring any bells as legitimate system files. This could be a sign that an attacker is attempting to execute scripts from non-standard locations, possibly dropped by other means.\n\nAdditionally, some events involve registry value changes. Malware often uses registry modifications to achieve persistence or to store configuration data. The combination of file creation, registry changes, and repeated PowerShell executions makes me more cautious.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these could be legitimate activities, such as system updates, script-based backups, or automated processes. However, the specific paths and command structures don't seem aligned with standard Microsoft practices or common system scripts I'm familiar with.\n\nThe fact that multiple events are occurring in quick succession and involve similar actions adds to the suspicion. Attackers often use scripting tools like PowerShell for their operations due to its extensive capabilities and the challenge it poses for detection.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination of repeated PowerShell executions with specific file checks, creation of non-standard files, registry modifications, and the involvement of `conhost.exe` raises concerns. These behaviors could be indicative of malicious activity aiming to establish persistence or execute scripts that aren't part of normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes:** The logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\n2. **Analyze File Operations:** \n   - PowerShell loads files from standard Microsoft locations (e.g., Windows Defender), which might not be suspicious.\n   - It creates files in the user's AppData directory, potentially indicating script execution or profile manipulation.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Events show registry modifications and process access, which can be signs of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\n4. **Command-Line Analysis:**\n   - The command lines use `Test-Path` to check for specific files, suggesting potential file execution based on presence.\n   - Repetitive patterns in command lines indicate possible scripting or automation, often seen in malicious activities.\n\n5. **File Paths and Script Execution:**\n   - The paths checked (e.g., `objeto_ativo_script.bat`) suggest non-standard script locations, possibly dropped by malware.\n   - `.bat` files are simple scripts that can execute commands; their presence in various directories is concerning.\n\n6. **Consider Legitimacy vs. Suspicion:**\n   - While some actions could be legitimate, the combination of file checks, script execution, and registry changes leans towards malicious intent.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** The overall behaviorâ€”repeated PowerShell use, specific file operations, and potential persistence mechanismsâ€”indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity. The repeated use of `powershell.exe`, combined with file creation in non-standard locations, registry modifications, and specific script checks, suggests possible unauthorized access or malware execution. These behaviors are not typically associated with legitimate operations, making this log set highly suspicious and worthy of further investigation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Interesting}}"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for both legitimate administration tasks and malicious activities. So any repeated use could be suspicious, especially if the commands aren't clearly benign.\n\nLooking at each event, many of them involve file operations like creation or deletion. For example, there's a file being created and then immediately deleted in the same script: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1\". That seems odd because why create a script only to delete it right away? Could that be an attempt to avoid detection by not leaving any traces?\n\nThen, there are events where powershell.exe is checking for specific files. The command lines show something like:\n{if (Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo..pacote_temporario.objeto_temporario_script.bat\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\nThis looks like a check to see if certain files exist, possibly before executing some other actions. If these files aren't there, it exits. That could be part of a larger script trying to access or execute malicious content elsewhere.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry value sets from chrome.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes, doing this multiple times without any apparent reason might indicate something's off, especially if it's outside normal user activity.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for .NET framework and Windows Defender files. This could be part of legitimate operations, but considering the other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern that powershell.exe is loading these modules for potential malicious use.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell commands checking for specific files, creating\/deleting temporary files quickly, registry manipulations from chrome.exe, and loading various DLLs. This combination raises flags because it seems like a script is attempting actions that could be part of a larger attack, such as persistence or payload delivery.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern suggests possible malicious behavior. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context. There's enough activity to warrant further investigation, but it might just be legitimate scripting gone wrong or a false positive. My confidence is around 0.7 because while there are red flags, some of these actions could have benign explanations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated ImageLoad events which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve creating new items and setting content in various BAT files. The commands look like they're using Powershell to create batch scripts and set their content to \"dir\". This could be legitimate scripting or something malicious.\n\nThe events start with the creation of a process named powershell.exe, which is normal for script execution. Then there are multiple access tasks, registry changes, and image loads, all typical when running scripts that involve .NET frameworks.\n\nLooking at each event, I notice that each time Powershell runs, it's creating new files in different directories and setting their content to \"dir\". This pattern repeats several times across different paths. The fact that the same command is being run multiple times with slight variations in the file paths might indicate automation or script execution testing different areas.\n\nI'm concerned because these actions could be part of a larger script or payload trying to create persistence mechanisms, write malicious scripts to disk, or perform reconnaissance by executing \"dir\" commands. The repeated use of Powershell, which is often used for scripting and can execute arbitrary code, raises flags, especially when combined with file creation and content setting.\n\nWhile it's possible that this could be a legitimate system administration task, the repetitive nature and varied paths might suggest something more nefarious. Malicious actors often test different directories to avoid detection or ensure their scripts run regardless of certain configurations.\n\nConsidering all these points together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because it shows multiple instances of Powershell executing similar commands across various locations, which could indicate malicious activity like script injection or persistence setup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating and modifying files with suspicious command lines involving .bat scripts and directory listings.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute scripts.\n\nNext, I notice that a script was created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's unusual because deleting temporary files can sometimes be an attempt to cover tracks. Also, there are several registry value sets from powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms or changes to system configurations, which might be malicious.\n\nLooking at the file operations, a .bat file is being created in multiple locations like \"modulo_base\", \"pacote_temporario\", and others. The paths seem arbitrary, but creating files across different directories could be part of a broader attack strategy, perhaps spreading components to make detection harder.\n\nThe events also include image loads for DLLs, which are normal for PowerShell scripts, but the volume might indicate something is off.

This seems normal as it's a common utility used to display user information.\n2. **Event 2**: Powershell.exe accessed something. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye out for more powershell events.\n3. **Events 3-9**: Multiple instances where powershell is being executed with command lines that check if certain files exist. The paths mentioned are quite long and have unusual names like `pacote_principal`, `estrutura_secundario`, etc. This looks a bit odd because these don't seem to be standard file locations or naming conventions. It could indicate someone trying to verify the presence of specific files, possibly malicious in nature.\n4. **Event 10**: Powershell.exe was created again with another command line checking for a file at `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`. Again, similar pattern as before.\n5. **Events 11-13**: Powershell accessed and images loaded. These are normal operations when running powershell scripts, but combined with the previous events, it might be part of malicious activities like loading modules or executing code.\n\nNow, considering all these together: multiple attempts to check for files using powershell commands, each time exiting based on whether a file exists or not. This behavior could be indicative of an attacker verifying if certain tools or components are present before executing further malicious actions. The use of powershell, especially with such specific and non-standard paths, raises red flags because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nI should also think about the context: these events are spread across several entries, showing repeated attempts to check file existence, which might be part of a larger script or payload deployment.

So, I'm given a JSONL file with multiple entries, each representing an event. My goal is to look at all these events together and decide whether they merit further investigation.\n\nFirst off, looking through the events, I notice that most of them involve PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. Malware developers love it because it can execute scripts and commands without leaving too obvious a footprint.\n\nBreaking down the events:\n\n1. **Image Loaded**: There are multiple entries where powershell.exe loads images like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. These look like they could be legitimate Windows Defender files, but sometimes attackers might use similar names to blend in.\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: I see a file being created and then immediately deleted. This is suspicious because attackers often create temporary files for malicious purposes and delete them quickly to avoid detection.\n3. **Pipe Created**: A pipe event could be used for inter-process communication, which might not be inherently bad, but in the context of multiple PowerShell activities, it could indicate something more nefarious.\n4. **Engine Lifecycle Events**: These are normal operations for PowerShell scripts, but when combined with other actions, they can signal script execution.\n5. **Registry Value Set**: Modifying registry values is a common technique in malware to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n6. **Process Access and Creation**: There are several instances where processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe are created. While these tools are standard, their use alongside PowerShell might be part of a larger attack chain.\n7. **Command-Line Arguments**: The command lines for some powershell.exe instances have complex scripts checking for file existence. This could be an attempt to verify if certain files exist before proceeding with more malicious actions.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but the sequence shows repeated and varied activities from the same process (powershell.exe), which might indicate a script running multiple commands in quick succession. The temporary file creation\/deletion stands out as it's often used in attacks to avoid leaving traces.\n\nMoreover, there are two cmd.exe processes with command-line arguments checking for file existence. This could be part of a larger script that tries to execute different payloads based on certain conditions. It's also worth noting the use of whoami.exe, which is commonly used to check user privileges or system information, potentially as part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe combination of these eventsâ€”loading specific DLLs, creating and deleting files, accessing processes, modifying registry entriesâ€”is concerning. These actions don't seem to align with normal user activity. They could be indicative of a script trying to establish persistence, gather information, or execute malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the multiple registry writes. While legitimate software does this during installation or configuration, frequent writes without clear purpose can signal tampering. The repeated process accesses might also suggest an attempt to hide activities or gain elevated privileges.\n\nIn summary, while individual events could be benign, their cumulative effect raises red flags. The pattern of behavior across these logs doesn't fit typical user or system actions, making the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

It's loading images like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are Defender-related files. That seems normal because Defender uses these DLLs for operations.\n\nThen I see file creation events in the Windows Temp directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. These temporary PowerShell scripts might be part of policy testing by the system or legitimate processes, but it's a bit suspicious that they're being created and then deleted right after.\n\nThere are also several instances where PowerShell is checking if specific .cs files exist using Test-Path in their command lines. It looks like these checks are part of some script execution logicâ€”if the file exists, exit with 0; else, exit with 1. This could be a way to determine whether certain scripts or components are present on the system.\n\nThe process is accessing other processes and modifying registry values. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious but can indicate scripting activity that might be part of a larger campaign.\n\nFinally, there are multiple checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script across various paths. This script name suggests it's related to keylogging or capturing keystrokes, which is definitely concerning. The repeated attempts to check if this script exists could mean the system is probing for its presence, possibly indicating an attempt to deploy or execute malicious code.\n\nPutting it all together, while some of these activities are normal PowerShell operations, the combinationâ€”especially the repeated checks for a keylogging script and the temporary script creationsâ€”raises red flags. This batch likely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious activity including file creation\/deletion in temp directories, registry modifications, and repeated checks for a keylogging script.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell process checking if a script exists in a specific path. If it doesn't exist, the process exits with 0, which seems odd because usually you'd expect an error code on failure. The task is labeled as 'Provider Lifecycle', which I'm not too familiar with, but it might be part of some system process.\n\nThe second event is just the name of powershell.exe with a task related to registry value set. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell often interacts with the registry for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThird event again shows powershell.exe starting with a command line that checks another script path. The task here is 'Process Create', which means this is a new process being created. The use of Test-Path suggests it's checking if a malicious script exists, possibly to avoid execution if detected.\n\nLooking at the fourth and fifth events, they're both 'Process accessed' tasks on powershell.exe. Accessing processes can be normal, but in combination with other events, it might indicate something more.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs. This is typical when a program starts up and loads necessary libraries, so I'm not too worried about that unless the DLLs are known malicious ones.\n\nThe next event shows a file being created and then immediately deleted by powershell.exe in the same path. Creating temporary files and deleting them quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection or to execute code without leaving evidence.\n\nLooking further down, there's another process creation of powershell.exe with a similar command line structure checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths. This script is known to log keystrokes, which is definitely malicious behavior. The task here is 'Engine Lifecycle', which might relate to how PowerShell initializes or terminates.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where the same check is performed across different directories, suggesting a persistence mechanism trying to locate its payload in various locations.\n\nFinally, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which seems unrelated to the malicious activities unless it's part of the log tampering.\n\nPutting this all together, the consistent use of PowerShell to check for and potentially execute scripts that are known for malicious purposes (like keystroke logging) is a red flag. The multiple attempts to locate the script across different paths suggest an active attempt to ensure the payload is present or executed. The file creation and deletion could be part of dropping and executing the script temporarily to avoid detection.\n\nConsidering all these points, this batch of events shows signs of potential malicious activity using PowerShell for persistence and execution of scripts with harmful purposes. Therefore, it's definitely interesting from an investigative standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths, which is a known malicious script used for keystroke logging.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is often used for legitimate administration tasks but can also be a red flag because attackers might use it for command execution and lateral movement. The events show that powershell.exe was creating files in the StartupProfileData directory and accessing other processes. This could indicate suspicious activity since attackers sometimes create persistence points or access other processes to hide their tracks.\n\nNext, there are several instances where whoami.exe is being executed. While whoami is a standard tool for querying user information, repeated use without clear justification might be concerning. It's often used in reconnaissance to gather system information, so multiple executions could be part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking at the RegistryEvent tasks, both powershell.exe and svchost.exe are modifying registry values. Registry modifications can be malicious, such as creating persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations to allow unauthorized access. The fact that these events occur multiple times raises suspicion.\n\nThere's also a notable amount of network activity from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome is commonly used, but the frequency of NetworkConnect and DnsQuery events might indicate data exfiltration or communication with external servers, which could be part of a malicious payload's command and control activities.\n\nAdditionally, urlmon.dll being loaded by both Calculator.exe and winlogbeat.exe stands out. This DLL is related to URL handling and could potentially be exploited for malicious purposes, such as establishing connections or injecting code.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of powershell activity, registry modifications, repeated whoami executions, and excessive network traffic suggests a possible attack. These activities are often part of an attacker's toolkit for lateral movement, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistence. The volume of suspicious processes and events increases my confidence that this batch is indeed concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, registry modifications, and network connections suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I've been given a batch of events in JSONL format, each representing some log entries from a system. My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event shows that 'chrome.exe' made a DNS query. That's normal because browsers do need to resolve domains when browsing the web. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to 'powershell.exe'. The second and third events show that powershell accessed processes and created new ones. I know that PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers for various tasks. So repeated process access could be a red flag but it's also common in legitimate use.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, again, 'powershell.exe' accessing a process. Then another event where it set a registry value. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're often used in persistence mechanisms by malware. But sometimes scripts do this for configuration purposes. I'll have to see how many times this happens.\n\nThe fifth and sixth events are more powershell actions: creating processes with specific command lines. The command line seems to involve some directory listings using 'ls' and 'get-childitem'. This looks like a script that's enumerating files, which might be part of data gathering or reconnaissance. Not sure if it's malicious yet.\n\nThen there's a file creation in the Temp folder with a PowerShell script named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1'. The fact that a new script is created and then deleted shortly after raises eyebrows. Creating and deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nLooking further down, there are several events where the same command line with directory listings is executed multiple times. This repetition might indicate that something is running in a loop or as part of a script, possibly trying to gather information across different directories or systems.\n\nPutting it all together, I notice a pattern: multiple powershell processes creating and deleting files, accessing registry values, and performing file operations that could be for persistence or data exfiltration. The repeated use of powershell with similar commands might suggest automated behavior, which is often seen in attacks to avoid detection by varying the attack techniques.\n\nI'm also considering if these actions are normal admin tasks. Sometimes scripts run by admins can do a lot, but the combination of creating temporary files and deleting them quickly, along with multiple registry accesses, seems less likely to be routine. Additionally, the specific command lines include 'ls -recurse' which is not typical in standard PowerShell usage for directory traversal.\n\nTherefore, while some actions individually might not be suspicious, the overall pattern across all events suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and performing file operations, including creating and deleting a script in the Temp folder, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, a lot of them involve PowerShell.exe. That immediately stands out because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines in some events have commands like 'ls -recurse', which lists directories recursively, and 'get-childitem' which does similar things. These are common commands but could be part of a larger script or activity.\n\nI notice that several events mention tasks related to file creation and registry value sets. For example, there's a PowerShell process creating files in different paths, including user-specific folders like the Downloads directory. Creating files, especially in non-standard locations, can sometimes indicate malicious behavior, like setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are also entries where conhost.exe is accessing registry values. Conhost.exe is often used by scripts to run commands, and it's a common vector for attackers because it's part of the Windows OS but can be misused. The fact that both PowerShell and conhost are interacting with the registry might suggest an attempt to modify system configurations or install malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where files are being written or created by these processes. Specifically, one event creates a file named 'estrutura_secundario.txt' in the Downloads folder. The name seems generic, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's suspicious. However, combined with other activities, it could be part of data exfiltration or setting up files for later use.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of similar commands and processes. The same PowerShell command line appears multiple times, which might indicate scripting or automated behavior. Attackers often use scripts to perform tasks like lateral movement, data gathering, or persistence.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, I'm leaning towards high because several red flags are present: repeated PowerShell activity with file creation, registry modifications, and the presence of conhost.exe. These activities together suggest potential malicious intent rather than normal user behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch seems interesting due to multiple indicators pointing toward possible malicious activities involving system changes, file operations, and use of tools commonly associated with attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve PowerShell.exe with suspicious commands like 'ls -recurse' and file creations in user folders. Registry modifications and the use of conhost.exe further indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
