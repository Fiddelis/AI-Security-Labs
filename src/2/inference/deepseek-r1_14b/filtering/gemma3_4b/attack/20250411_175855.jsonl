{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at three JSON objects here, each representing an event.\n\nFirst event: The process is powershell.exe and the winlog task is Process accessed with rule ProcessAccess. That might be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. But just accessing it doesn't necessarily mean something bad happened.\n\nSecond event: whoami.exe is run from C:\\Windows\\system32, which is a standard system directory. The command line seems normal—it's just running the whoami command without any unusual arguments. This process create event might not be suspicious on its own since whoami is commonly used to get user information.\n\nThird event: Another powershell.exe access. So now we have two instances of powershell being accessed in a short time. That could be a sign of something more concerning, especially if these accesses are part of a larger pattern or if they're accessing restricted areas.\n\nPutting it all together, having multiple powershell.exe accesses might raise an eyebrow, but without additional context like network activity, file changes, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to say for sure. The whoami.exe process seems benign. So the batch is somewhat interesting because of the repeated use of powershell, which could indicate potential malicious activity, but there's not enough evidence here to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first two events are from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files and some normal processes like notepad.exe accessing the registry. Nothing unusual there. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe, which is a known Windows process for managing runtime components, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I notice powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but access alone isn't suspicious. It could be legitimate admin work or malicious activity. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Then calc.exe loading urlmon.dll—that's normal as it's part of Windows system files.\n\nThere are several svchost.exe events modifying the registry. SvcHost is a common process for running services, and it's not inherently bad. However, repeated registry modifications could be concerning if they're unexpected or in large numbers.\n\nLooking further, Calculator.exe setting registry values—again, normal unless it's doing something unusual. More powershell.exe activity, same as before. Then there are multiple chrome.exe events accessing the registry and loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These could be legitimate parts of Chrome's operation or signs of tampering.\n\nConsidering all these events together: there are repeated registry writes by various processes, especially svchost.exe and chrome.exe. While each event might not be suspicious on its own, the sheer number could indicate something is off. For example, multiple registry writes in a short period can sometimes be part of malicious activity like installing malware or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe confidence level isn't super high because none of these events are definitive signs of an attack, but the clustering around registry modifications and use of tools like PowerShell might raise some flags for potential investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by various processes including svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, and Chrome.exe. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior or unusual system modifications that merit further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm going to analyze them one by one to see if there's anything interesting or concerning that stands out.\n\nStarting with the first few events, I notice multiple instances of \"chrome.exe\" making network connections and DNS queries. While Chrome is a common application, repeated network activity could be suspicious if it's not typical behavior for the user. But on its own, it might just be regular browsing.\n\nThen there's an event where \"whoami.exe\" is executed. Whoami is often used to find out user information, which can be part of legitimate activities but also potentially malicious ones like recon or privilege escalation. The command line seems straightforward, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, several events involve powershell.exe being accessed and modified registry values. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but is also a favorite for attackers due to its scripting capabilities. Seeing multiple access and modification events on the registry could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, which raises some red flags.\n\nThere are also cmd.exe instances with commands like \"dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key\" followed by findstr looking for .key files. This seems like it's searching for key files in a directory structure, possibly trying to locate sensitive information or configuration keys. The fact that this is being done via command line scripts could be an attempt to gather information maliciously.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where winlogbeat.exe creates files. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management and shipping, so if it's creating new config files, that might not be concerning on its own unless there's unauthorized access or changes to sensitive logs.\n\nAnother point of interest is the file creation by powershell.exe named \"tarefa_geral.txt\". Powershell writing to a text file could be part of data exfiltration or log activities. Without knowing the content, it's hard to say, but it's worth monitoring.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are multiple indicators that suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of using powershell and cmd.exe for registry modifications, searching for files with .key extensions, and creating files could be part of an attack chain. While each individual event might not be alarming, the pattern collectively raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or data theft.\n\nI need to assess the confidence level here. Some events could easily be explained by user actions or legitimate processes, but the frequency and combination are notable. The repeated use of powershell.exe for registry changes and file operations stands out, as does the cmd.exe script searching directories. These activities don't align with typical user behavior, making me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n\nThe justification would be that there's a series of potentially malicious activities involving elevated privileges and data search, which together indicate possible unauthorized access or attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity including powershell.exe accessing processes, modifying registry values, and file creation. Cmd.exe is used to search for .key files, potentially indicating data exfiltration or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
