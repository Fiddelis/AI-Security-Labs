{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events, each with process info, winlog tasks, and sometimes file paths.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: there's MpDefenderCoreService.exe which might be related to antivirus. Then, chrome.exe appears multiple times with network connections, but that seems normal since browsers connect to servers. Powershell.exe is used a few times—I know it's commonly abused in attacks because it's powerful and can do many things.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks: There are Network connection detected events for Chrome, which isn't too worrying on its own. Process access and create events for various processes—powershell.exe accessing something might be normal but could also be a red flag depending on context. Registry value sets for cmd.exe, powershell.exe, etc., could indicate malicious activity since attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence.\n\nI notice that there are multiple registry writes from different processes. That's interesting because it suggests some activity trying to change system configurations. Also, the command lines for cmd.exe and findstr.exe seem suspicious. For example, \"cmd.exe \/c dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key | findstr \/e .key\" looks like it's searching for files ending with \".key\", which might be looking for API keys or sensitive information.\n\nAnother point is that the same process creates multiple files and accesses registry values repeatedly. This could indicate some automated script running, maybe trying to gather data or alter system settings in a way that suggests persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there might be malicious activity happening across different processes. The combination of network connections, file creation, and registry modifications from various tools known for abuse (like powershell.exe) makes this batch stand out as potentially suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations, network connections, and registry modifications, particularly from powershell.exe and cmd.exe with potentially malicious command lines. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal since it's probably the log gathering tool itself writing logs. Not suspicious.\n\nNext up is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. I remember that RuntimeBroker handles user runtime permissions in Windows, so this could be legitimate activity. Nothing fishy here.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe doing the same registry set task. Again, Notepad is a common app, and it accessing or modifying some registry keys might be part of its operation, though less common. Still, I'm not raising flags yet.\n\nPowershell.exe is next, and it's accessing a process. Powershell is often used for both good and evil. Accessing processes could be legitimate admin work or something malicious. But just accessing without any other indicators isn't enough on its own.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll—wait, that seems odd. Calculator shouldn't need to load system DLLs like urlmon, which handles URLs in Windows. That might be a red flag. Could it be a sign of a process injection or something malicious?\n\nLooking further down, svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times. SvcHost is a generic host for services, so it's tricky because many legitimate services run under it, but also malware can mimic it. Multiple events could indicate something, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nCalculator.exe again setting registry values—another instance of an unexpected process doing that. Combining this with the earlier calc.exe event might add up to something concerning.\n\nAnother powershell.exe accessing processes, which is another point of interest given its dual use.\n\nThen there's a bunch of chrome.exe events—all related to registry sets and loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Chrome doing these things is normal for its operation, but so many instances could indicate something's off, maybe some extension or script running multiple times?\n\nLooking at all these together: calc.exe loading unusual DLLs, powershell.exe accessing processes, and multiple registry writes by various processes. These might be indicators of potential malicious activity. The number of events also suggests possible automated or repeated actions that could be part of a campaign.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags across different processes, especially the calc.exe and powershell activities, which don't seem to align with their typical use cases. However, I'm not entirely certain since some events might be legitimate operations. My confidence is around 0.6 because while there are multiple points of interest, they could still be explained by normal system behavior in some cases.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including calc.exe and powershell.exe show unusual activity such as loading unexpected DLLs and accessing registry values, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe was accessed with the task \"ProcessAccess\". PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be something to look into.\n\nNext, there's an event where whoami.exe was run using the command line. Whoami is typically used to get user information, which might seem harmless, but in some contexts, it can be part of recon or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the third event again, powershell.exe was accessed once more with ProcessAccess. Repeated accesses of PowerShell without any other activity could indicate scripting or automated processes. Since both events involve accessing these executables, I'm starting to see a pattern that might not be normal.\n\nI should consider if this combination is common. Legit users might run whoami偶尔 and powershell for administrative tasks, but the repetition and the specific tasks make me think there's something more going on. Maybe someone is trying to gather information or escalate privileges.\n\nThe confidence level is 0.85 because while it's not conclusive, the repeated ProcessAccess on PowerShell along with running whoami could indicate malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell access and execution of whoami.exe, which could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
