Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from both Chrome and PowerShell. The Chrome process has multiple instances where the task is \"Registry value set.\" That seems a bit unusual because Chrome doesn't typically modify system registry values often. Maybe it's related to some extension or plugin? But doing that so many times in a row might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are several entries from powershell.exe. Some of them have command lines pointing to specific PowerShell scripts, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. I remember that script is often used for keylogging, which is definitely malicious. The fact that it's being executed multiple times and with different paths suggests some persistence mechanism.\n\nAlso, the events where PowerShell accesses processes and loads images could be indicators of malicious activities. Loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll might be part of normal operation, but combined with other suspicious behaviors, it raises a red flag.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process running is another point to consider. It's usually used to get user information, which can be part of reconnaissance by attackers to see who they're interacting as.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple registry modifications from Chrome, repeated PowerShell executions with keylogging scripts, and process accessesâ€”it feels like a coordinated attack. The confidence here would be high because the combination points towards malicious activities rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: numerous registry modifications by chrome.exe, repeated powershell.exe executions with command lines pointing to keylogging scripts, and process accesses. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's look at each event one by one and then see the bigger picture.\n\nFirst event: Process is svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local... The path looks legitimate because svchost is a common Windows process, often associated with services. But sometimes it's used by malware too. However, the file name keyValueLKG.dat sounds familiar; I think that might be part of Windows' Delivery Optimization feature, which caches updates. So this could be normal system behavior.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK tool for log shipping. It's common for such tools to create or update their configuration files when starting up. The path seems standard for where someone might install and run logs from. Not suspicious.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_padrao.txt in the same Downloads folder as before. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by admins but also by attackers. However, creating a text file isn't inherently bad. It could be part of legitimate script execution or setup steps. Without more context on what's inside the file, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at all together: svchost doing its thing, winlogbeat setting up logs, and powershell making a file. No obvious red flags like process injection, writes to known bad paths, or multiple failed attempts that indicate probing. Each action seems within normal operations for these processes.\n\nBut wait, the fact that two files are being created in the same Downloads folder by different processes might raise an eyebrow. Maybe someone is setting up tools or configurations there? Or perhaps it's just coincidental.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because each event on its own isn't malicious, and together they don't show a clear pattern of attack. However, I'm not 100% certain because sometimes attackers use multiple steps that seem benign at first glance but are part of a larger plan.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes creating files in standard locations. Svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and powershell.exe performing file operations do not indicate malicious activity on their own.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds suspicious because it suggests it might be recording keystrokes, which is often associated with keyloggers used in malware.\n\nLooking deeper, the command lines show different paths pointing to various locations on the system. For example:\n- C:\\objeto_secundario\\tarefa_padrao\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\n- C:\\registro_ativo\\tarefa_temporario\\estrutura_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\n\nThese paths seem inconsistent and might be part of an attempt to disguise the origin of the script. Such inconsistencies can be red flags for malicious activity as attackers often use varying paths to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe with these scripts. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can execute system commands, which is why it's also commonly abused by malware for executing malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are logs showing file creation and deletion in temporary directories:\n- A file __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 was created and then deleted. This could be an attempt to bypass script execution policies by creating a small test script, which is a technique used by attackers to check if their malicious scripts will run.\n\nMoreover, there's an event where a remote command is executed:\n- The process is None, but the file path points to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in a different location. This could indicate that the script was fetched from elsewhere or executed remotely, which is another red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking at other entries, some are related to legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files and svchost.exe handling service profile data. These don't seem suspicious on their own but need to be considered in context with the rest of the logs.\n\nThe consistent use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across multiple events suggests a coordinated effort, possibly by malware aiming to capture keystrokes for espionage or fraud. The combination of inconsistent file paths, repeated script execution, and attempts to manipulate temporary files points towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nWhile there's no direct evidence of harmful actions (like exfiltration of data), the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence level isn't extremely high since some activities could be benign, but the overall trend leans towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which suggests potential keylogging activity. The inconsistent file paths and repeated execution patterns raise suspicions of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
