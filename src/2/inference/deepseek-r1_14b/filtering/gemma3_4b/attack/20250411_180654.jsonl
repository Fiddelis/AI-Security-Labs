Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is involved in different tasks. Notably, there's a process creation event for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, which immediately raises a red flag because this script is known to capture keystrokes and log them. That's definitely malicious behavior.\n\nThere are several instances of `powershell.exe` accessing other processes and files. For example, the file path `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt` might be used to store stolen data or as a staging point for further attacks. Powershell is commonly used in cyberattacks because it's powerful and can execute scripts that do a lot of damage.\n\nLooking at `chrome.exe`, I notice multiple registry writes. While Chrome does make changes to the registry, especially when updating extensions or settings, repeated registry modifications without clear purpose could be suspicious. However, on its own, this might not be enough unless combined with other factors.\n\nThe `whoami.exe` process is another point of interest. It's a legitimate tool but often used by attackers to gather information about the system, such as the current user or permissions, which can aid in lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe events involving mscoree.dll and related .NET files being loaded by Powershell could indicate that malicious scripts are using .NET libraries for their operations. This is common in more sophisticated attacks where additional functionality is needed beyond basic script execution.\n\nConsidering the volume of these activities—multiple process creations, file accesses, registry modifications, and image loads—it's clear that there's a chain of potentially harmful actions. The combination of Powershell executing scripts with malicious intent and other processes modifying system files and registry entries suggests a coordinated attack rather than isolated incidents.\n\nI'm also noticing repeated patterns in the command lines for Powershell.exe, which is unusual unless it's part of a script or automated process. This repetition might indicate that an attacker is running the same payload multiple times to ensure persistence or widespread impact across different parts of the system.\n\nIn summary, while some events on their own might not be alarming, the cumulative effect points towards malicious activity. The use of Powershell for potentially harmful scripts, combined with other system modifications, makes this batch highly relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing suspicious scripts, file creation and access, registry modifications, and process activity indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the events, a lot of them are powershell.exe processes. That immediately raises some flags because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines show paths like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" which sounds suspicious—keyloggers are often associated with malware trying to capture keystrokes to steal information.\n\nThere's also a pattern in the file paths: they all point to different locations but have similar structures, such as \"C:\\objeto_secundario\\tarefa_padrao...\" etc. This repetition might indicate that an attacker is using multiple scripts or different execution points to avoid detection. The fact that each script writes logs to the TEMP directory (key.log) could mean they're collecting keystroke data and then exfiltrating it later.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the creation and deletion of temporary files related to PowerShell scripts. For example, there's a file created at \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1\" which is immediately deleted. This behavior is common in malware to bypass certain security policies or to leave less trace.\n\nThe events also show various tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\", \"Engine Lifecycle\", and registry modifications. These could be part of normal operations, but combined with the other indicators, they might signal that something is amiss. Additionally, there's an event where a remote command is executed, which is another red flag because it suggests external control over the system.\n\nI also see some legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files and svchost.exe handling service profile data. But these don't seem to be the main focus here. The majority of concerning activity revolves around PowerShell executing scripts that might be malicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running keylogging scripts, temporary file creation\/deletion, remote command execution, and repeated script paths—these are all strong indicators of potentially malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which suggests potential keylogging activity. Temporary files related to these scripts are created and deleted, indicating possible attempts to evade detection or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of three events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event individually.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe creating a file in the path C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process, often used by legitimate services but can also be a sign of malware since it's frequently used inDLL injection attacks. The file created here seems to be related to Delivery Optimization, which I think is a Microsoft feature for updating Windows, so maybe this is normal system behavior.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat sounds familiar; I think it's an open-source tool used for log management, maybe part of the Elastic Stack. The presence here is in a user's Downloads folder, which might mean that someone is setting up log collection or monitoring software on their machine. That could be legitimate, but sometimes attackers use such tools to exfiltrate data.\n\nThe third event is powershell.exe creating C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but also commonly abused in attacks for command execution and script-based attacks. The filename \"entrada_padrao.txt\" translates to something like \"default entry\" in Portuguese, which doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's worth noting that the file is being created in the Downloads folder by a user named fiddelis.\n\nNow, looking at the batch as a whole: all three events involve files being created. Two are system processes (svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe) and one is PowerShell. The locations vary—system-related paths, downloads, and another download path. I'm thinking that if this was part of an attack, maybe multiple actions would be taken across different processes. But individually, each event could be legitimate.\n\nSvchost creating a file in its usual directory might not be suspicious. Winlogbeat is likely running as part of some monitoring setup, and the PowerShell script creating a file could just be a user or admin performing tasks.\n\nHowever, considering that the events are together, if these were all happening around the same time from different processes, it might indicate a coordinated action, possibly malicious. For example, svchost.exe is often used by malware to hide their activities. Winlogbeat being present might suggest data collection for exfiltration, and PowerShell could be executing commands to establish persistence or spread.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure because each event on its own isn't necessarily malicious. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe the confidence should be lower since there's no clear pattern of immediate malicious activity across all three events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains process activities that could indicate potential malicious behavior, such as svchost.exe, often used by malware, and powershell.exe, commonly abused for attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
