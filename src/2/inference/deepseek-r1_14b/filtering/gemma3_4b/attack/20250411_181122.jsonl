I'm going to go through each event step by step and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve processes like powershell.exe, calc.exe, notepad.exe, etc., which aren't immediately suspicious on their own. However, some details catch my eye.\n\nThe first event shows a powershell.exe process with a command line that includes \"findstr\" searching for \"pass\" in various file types and then using select-string to find the pattern \"password\". That seems like it could be data extraction or credential harvesting, which is concerning. So this might indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses files and registry entries, sometimes creating new files. These activities can be part of persistence mechanisms or trying to hide traces. Also, processes like svchost.exe and conhost.exe modifying the registry could be signs of malware attempting to install itself or modify system configurations.\n\nOther events show normal user activity, like notepad.exe editing a file or calc.exe loading dlls, which don't raise flags on their own. However, when combined with the suspicious powershell activities, they might indicate an attacker trying to blend in normal behavior.\n\nI notice several process creations and accesses related to different parts of the system, including FileCreate events and ImageLoad events for known system files like urlmon.dll, which are usually benign but could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nOverall, while some events are innocent, the repeated powershell.exe commands with potentially malicious intent make this batch stand out.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, each line being a separate event. The main processes involved are \"chrome.exe\" and \"winlogbeat.exe\", with one instance involving \"powershell.exe\". \n\nStarting with \"chrome.exe\": There are numerous entries where Chrome is setting registry values, making DNS queries, loading images like AMSI DLL and MpOAV DLL, and establishing network connections. These activities by themselves aren't unusual since Chrome is a common browser that interacts with various system components and the internet.\n\nLooking at the tasks:\n- **Registry value set**: This is typical for applications to store settings.\n- **Dns query**: Standard behavior when navigating websites.\n- **Image loaded**: Necessary for functionality, especially security-related ones like AMSI which checks for malicious scripts.\n- **Network connection detected**: Expected as Chrome communicates with servers.\n\nThe \"winlogbeat.exe\" process creates a file in the user's directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used to collect and send logs, so this file creation is part of its operation.\n\nThere's one event from \"powershell.exe\" creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. While PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, a single file creation without additional context (like execution or other suspicious actions) isn't conclusive. However, combined with the extensive Chrome activity, it raises a slight concern but not enough to be certain.\n\nI also notice that most events are repetitive and don't indicate any unusual patterns beyond normal user activity. No signs of failed login attempts, access to restricted files, or known malicious process trees are present.\n\nTherefore, while there's some minor red flags (like the PowerShell file creation), the overall batch doesn't demonstrate clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior when considered as a whole.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal user activity from Chrome, including registry modifications, DNS queries, image loading, and network connections.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's a process named \"whoami.exe\" being created. That doesn't seem too suspicious on its own because whoami is a common tool used to check user information. Not sure if that's bad yet.\n\nNext, I see multiple events related to powershell.exe. The command line in one of them catches my eye: it has a string with \"pass\", and file extensions like *.xml, *.doc, etc., which makes me think it might be searching for passwords or sensitive information. That could be a red flag because scripts looking for passwords might indicate data theft.\n\nThen, there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and files. The fact that it's modifying the registry suggests potential persistence mechanisms or configuration changes, which are often used by malware to maintain access.\n\nI also notice multiple Image Load events from powershell.exe. These could be loading DLLs for various purposes, but sometimes attackers load malicious modules or legitimate ones in a way that hides their activities. This needs closer examination because some of these might not be standard operations.\n\nLooking further down, there's a File Create event for a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1. Then immediately after, it's deleted. That's concerning because creating and then deleting files can help hide evidence or prevent analysis by security tools. This behavior is often seen in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are Pipe Created events which could be used for inter-process communication. While legitimate, they can also be abused by attackers to communicate with other processes, especially if combined with the other suspicious activities.\n\nAnother point is that several events have the same command line looking for passwords across different file types. This repeated pattern suggests a focused effort to search through various documents and files, which could indicate data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities.\n\nThe repetition of similar process creations and provider lifecycles in the logs also stands out. It might be an attempt to run multiple instances of the same malicious script, possibly to avoid detection or to spread across different processes for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: a suspicious PowerShell script searching for sensitive information, creating then deleting temporary files, accessing the registry, loading various DLLs, and using pipes—these are all indicators that could point towards malicious activity. The combination of these events makes me think this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including searching for sensitive information across various file types and creating\/deleting temporary files.

I'm just starting with system logs and cybersecurity, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data, each line represents an event. There are several processes mentioned like 'powershell.exe', 'cmd.exe', 'whoami.exe', 'schtasks.exe', and others. These seem like legitimate Windows tools, but they can also be used maliciously.\n\nLet me go through each event:\n\n1. winlogbeat.exe creating a file: This seems normal as it's likely the log shipping tool setting up its configuration.\n2. powershell.exe creating a file named 'estrutura_ativo.txt': PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but creating files could be suspicious depending on where and what they contain.\n3. Another instance of winlogbeat.exe doing the same thing as above: Repetition might not be alarming yet.\n4. powershell.exe accessing a process: Process access isn't inherently bad, but it's something to note if combined with other actions.\n5. whoami.exe being run from system32: This is a standard tool for checking user information; usually benign unless part of privilege escalation.\n6. More powershell.exe process accesses: Again, without context, this could be normal admin activity or malicious.\n7. powershell.exe modifying the registry: Registry changes can be part of legitimate configuration but are also common in malware for persistence.\n8. cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks and running other commands: Using command-line tools to delete tasks might indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable security features.\n9. schtasks.exe being used to delete more tasks: Similar to the above, this could be cleaning up after malicious activity.\n10. svchost.exe modifying registry: Svchost is a legitimate process but often used by malware. Registry changes here could be setting up persistence.\n11. cmd.exe again with another command: Another deletion of processes (notepad.exe), which might be trying to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe for process creation, file operations, and registry modifications is concerning. Additionally, the deletion of scheduled tasks and processes could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt normal system functions. The combination suggests possible malicious activity, such as installing malware, creating backdoors, or trying to remove evidence.\n\nHowever, without more context (like timestamps showing rapid succession or known indicators of compromise), it's hard to be certain. But the variety and nature of these events lean towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of legitimate tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe performing actions such as file creation, process access, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is from powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is often used by admins but can also be a vector for attacks. Then there's cmd.exe setting a registry value—nothing too odd yet, as scripts might do that.\n\nNext, WMIC.exe is deleting notepad.exe processes. That's interesting because WMIC is known to be abused in ransomware and other attacks. The command line shows it's deleting the process, which could indicate malicious activity trying to stop monitoring tools.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of ImageLoad events from WMIC.exe loading system DLLs. That might be normal, but combined with previous actions, it raises a flag. Then powershell.exe is accessing and modifying registry values again—several times in a row which could indicate repeated attempts or persistence mechanisms.\n\nCmd.exe deleting user accounts via net.exe and cmd commands catches my attention. Deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" sounds suspicious—it's targeting specific admin accounts, possibly trying to remove traces or disable accounts for persistence.\n\nMultiple Process Create events for whoami.exe might be checking the system's identity or privileges, which is common in recon activity. The net1.exe command line shows another deletion of a user account, adding to the pattern of user removal.\n\nLastly, there are more registry writes from various processes and even a User Account Management event with no process name, which could indicate something trying to cover its tracks.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated deletions of admin accounts using cmd.exe, multiple powershell accesses, WMIC being used to delete processes, and several registry modifications. This combination looks like an attack attempting to remove user accounts and possibly disable monitoring tools. The use of multiple techniques (registry writes, process deletion) suggests a possible APT or ransomware activity trying to establish persistence and cover tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including repeated deletions of user accounts, usage of WMIC.exe for process termination, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event.\n\nFirst, I notice that the processes involved are powershell.exe and cmd.exe quite a bit. Both are common tools for legitimate use but can also be used maliciously. For example, command-line tools like these can execute scripts or commands which might delete files or modify system settings.\n\nLooking at the specific events:\n\n1. There's a PowerShell process accessing something, possibly with a RegistryEvent. I remember that registry modifications can indicate malicious activity, like creating persistence mechanisms.\n2. Then there are cmd.exe instances deleting temp files. The paths in the file deletions look suspicious—names like 'unidade_temporario_calc.txt' and 'estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe'. These seem to be temporary files, but maybe they're part of a malicious process trying to clean up after themselves.\n3. There's also conhost.exe being used, which is often associated with command-line tools but can sometimes be involved in hiding processes or attacks.\n4. The whoami.exe process caught my eye too. That's a legitimate tool for checking user permissions, but it could be part of privilege escalation if used improperly.\n5. There are multiple events where PowerShell is started and then exits quickly, possibly indicating a script execution that doesn't require an interactive session.\n\nPutting this together: the combination of using cmd.exe to delete specific files, registry modifications via both cmd.exe and powershell.exe, and repeated process creations with conhost.exe and whoami.exe suggests potential malicious activity. It looks like someone might be trying to cover their tracks by deleting temporary files and making changes to system configurations.\n\nThe high frequency of these events is also concerning. While isolated incidents could be benign, the repetition over several entries makes it more likely that this is part of a coordinated attack or script execution rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including file deletions and registry modifications by cmd.exe and powershell.exe, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several entries where powershell.exe is being accessed with a ProcessAccess task. That's something to note because PowerShell can be used for malicious activities. But on its own, accessing it doesn't necessarily mean anything bad—it could just be a legitimate script or admin task.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being run. Whoami is generally used to find out user information, which in some contexts might be part of an attack, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. It's also possible this is part of system monitoring scripts.\n\nI notice that RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe are accessing URLMON.DLL via ImageLoad events. I'm not immediately sure if this is suspicious, but sometimes DLLs can be used maliciously. However, URLMON is a legitimate Windows component, so maybe it's just normal operation.\n\nThere are several entries from svchost.exe making registry changes. SvcHost is a common process for various services, and modifying the registry isn't inherently bad. It could be part of service configuration changes or updates.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe logs, there are multiple DNS queries and network connections. This seems pretty standard for a browser as it connects to websites and resolves domain names. But the number of events is quite high—12 entries for Chrome alone. That's a lot, but maybe the user was doing a lot of browsing or there were multiple tabs open.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory doesn't raise any red flags. It sounds like it's just writing its configuration file as part of operation.\n\nAlso, notepad.exe modifying registry values—Notepad is a simple text editor, so that seems unusual but without more context, I can't be sure if it's malicious.\n\nPutting this all together: There are multiple instances of legitimate processes doing normal things. Powershell and whoami could be red flags, but they're repeated and don't show any clear pattern or other suspicious activities like writing to unexpected files or network communications outside the usual.\n\nSo overall, while there are some events that individually might look a bit odd, together they don't form a coherent picture of malicious activity. It's possible these logs come from a system where users are running scripts, admins are monitoring, or applications are doing regular tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes and activities without clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. So, the user has provided a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My task is to look at all these events together and decide whether they merit further investigation.\n\nFirst off, I notice that almost every entry involves `powershell.exe`. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. It's versatile and often used in attacks, so its presence alone doesn't necessarily mean something bad, but it's definitely worth keeping an eye on.\n\nLooking closer, the events show various operations: images being loaded, files created and deleted, pipes created, registry changes, and process accesses. Let me break these down one by one.\n\n1. **Image Load Events**: There are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` loads images like `clrjit.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`. Legitimate software often does this, but sometimes malicious actors use legitimate processes to load malicious libraries. The paths here seem normal, pointing to Microsoft .NET Framework and Windows Defender components, which are trusted. However, the fact that these are loaded by PowerShell adds a layer of suspicion.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: There's a file created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`, which is then deleted shortly after. This could be part of normal script testing, but it might also indicate that the script was malicious and removed evidence. The creation and deletion within a short time frame is concerning.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation**: A pipe was created by `powershell.exe`. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but in some cases, they can be part of command injection or lateral movement techniques. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious, but it adds to the suspicion.\n\n4. **Registry Changes**: There's a registry value being set by both `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`. Registry modifications are common in attacks for persistence or configuration changes. This could be part of setting up a backdoor or altering system settings to facilitate further attacks.\n\n5. **Process Access**: Multiple events show that processes are accessing others, like `whoami.exe` being called. `whoami` is typically used to determine user privileges and can be part of reconnaissance in an attack. The repeated creation of this process by PowerShell might indicate attempts to escalate privileges or gather information about the system.\n\n6. **File Creation for Winlogbeat**: A file related to winlogbeat, which is an ELK Stack tool for log management, was created. This seems benign unless it's being used as part of a larger attack framework to exfiltrate logs or establish persistence.\n\nPutting all these together, the pattern suggests a potential malicious activity:\n\n- The repeated use of `powershell.exe` to perform various operations.\n- Creation and deletion of temporary files which could be an attempt to clean up traces.\n- Registry modifications that might set up persistence mechanisms.\n- Use of `whoami.exe` possibly for privilege escalation or user information gathering.\n- Pipe creation could be a communication channel between processes, potentially malicious.\n\nThe confidence level here is moderate because while the indicators are concerning, they aren't definitive proof of an attack. Some actions, like loading system DLLs and using ELK tools, can be legitimate. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities with file manipulations, registry changes, and process accesses creates a suspicious pattern that should definitely be looked into.\n\nIn conclusion, this batch of logs is \"INTERESTING\" due to the concerning activity patterns involving PowerShell and potential indicators of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve powershell.exe performing various operations including file creation\/deletion, registry changes, and process access. These activities could indicate malicious behavior such as script testing, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
