Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a PowerShell.exe process with a task indicating a registry value was set. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously, and accessing the registry often is part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, cmd.exe runs a command to create a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line has some red flags: it uses 'cmd \/c powershell.exe -ep bypass' which suggests they're trying to execute PowerShell without restrictions (bypassing execution policies). The script path in the command is pointing to NonExistingScript.ps1, but that might be an evasion technique—using a non-existent file to avoid detection. However, this could mean it's either a test or actual malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows cmd.exe setting a registry value again. That's another point of interest because unusual registry access can indicate tampering.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe creating another task with similar parameters as before, referencing a different script path (entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1). Again, the non-existing script might be an attempt to avoid detection or just part of the attack chain. The task name is 'win32times', which seems generic but could be a way to hide malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe, typically a legitimate process, is setting registry values multiple times. That's suspicious because svchost can be used by malware for persistence or other malicious activities. Each time it sets a registry value, it raises the concern of potential backdoor creation or configuration changes that allow persistent access.\n\nAnother svchost event shows file creation in the Windows Task folder—C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. This is concerning because creating files in system directories can indicate malicious activity, especially if the task is suspicious.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe again setting a registry value. The repetition of such actions by different processes suggests coordinated behavior, possibly part of an attack chain.\n\nConhost.exe also sets a registry value. I'm not too familiar with conhost.exe's typical activities, but any process using it for registry modifications without clear justification could be problematic.\n\nA file creation event from winlogbeat.exe seems normal since that's likely a legitimate tool for log management. Similarly, the powershell.exe creating a file in user downloads might be benign if related to legitimate scripts or data handling.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe processes setting registry values stand out. Chrome is a common process, but repeated registry writes could indicate extensions or plugins behaving maliciously, or potentially exploit activities.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: multiple processes (cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe) creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell commands that bypass execution policies, setting registry values, and file creations in system directories. These actions collectively suggest potential malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of these events—especially the use of known attack vectors like living off the land (using built-in tools like PowerShell and schtasks for malicious purposes), registry modifications for persistence, and file creation in sensitive locations—is indicative of an APT or sophisticated cyberattack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe execution with bypass flag, cmd.exe creating scheduled tasks with malicious scripts, registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes, and file creations in system directories suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by looking at each event one by one and then see if there's a pattern or something that stands out.\n\nThe first event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal because Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, so it's expected to create files there. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there's powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The creation of a text file could be part of a script or something harmless, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThen, two events show powershell.exe accessing processes. Process access in itself isn't unusual unless it's part of privilege escalation or lateral movement. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe fourth event is whoami.exe being run from the command line. Whoami is a standard tool to display user information, so that seems benign on its own.\n\nLooking at all events together: multiple instances of powershell.exe activity and the creation of files. The combination might be concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for executing commands or scripts. Also, creating a file named entrada_ativo.txt could be part of setting up persistence or storing malicious code.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is definitely malicious, but there are enough indicators that it's worth looking into further. So I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell activity and file creation, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
