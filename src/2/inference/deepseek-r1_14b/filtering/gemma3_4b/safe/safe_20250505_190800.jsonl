{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate event. The key fields here are \"process\", \"winlog\", and sometimes \"file\". Each event seems related to process creation, file operations, registry changes, or image loading.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file at .winlogbeat.yml.new. That's normal for log management tools like winlogbeat updating their configuration files. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE are setting registry values. MMC is commonly used to manage system components, so that's standard admin activity. Registry changes can be tricky, but without context, it might not indicate malicious behavior yet.\n\nThen there's a series of events involving powershell.exe. The first few entries show the creation of PowerShell processes and loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscorjit.dll. These are legitimate parts of PowerShell's operation for executing scripts and interacting with .NET frameworks.\n\nI notice multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from PowerShell, which could be part of its initialization process when starting up. Not unusual unless there's an abnormal number or timing.\n\nA file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1 is created and then deleted. This seems like a script test by PowerShell to check policy compliance. It's a known behavior, so that doesn't raise flags.\n\nThere are also pipe creation events in PowerShell, which can be part of inter-process communication or for handling command output. Again, normal operations.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem consistent with regular system activity, especially related to configuration changes and script execution via PowerShell. There's no evidence of unusual process behavior, failed attempts, or access to restricted resources. All the file paths are within standard directories, and the DLLs being loaded are expected for a running PowerShell instance.\n\nWhile it's possible that an attacker could abuse legitimate tools like PowerShell, this particular batch doesn't exhibit any overt signs of malicious activity. The events don't show unexpected combinations or sequences that would suggest exploitation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are typical system activities involving process creation and file operations by legitimate applications like PowerShell.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of log events. I see multiple entries related to powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The events include file creations, registry changes, and image loads.\n\nFirst, the creation ofteste.ps1 by powershell is suspicious because it's a script, often used for malicious purposes. Then, there are several ImageLoad events, which might indicate the script is loading various libraries—maybe trying to hide or execute something.\n\nLooking at the file operations: creating, deleting, and re-creating files in temporary directories suggests the script might be testing execution policies or attempting to persist itself. The .winlogbeat.yml.new file being created by winlogbeat.exe seems normal unless it's part of a larger attack vector.\n\nThe registry value set events could mean an attempt to modify system settings, potentially for persistence or privilege escalation. Also, the \"Execute a Remote Command\" event without any process details stands out as possibly malicious, though not enough context is provided.\n\nConsidering all these together—suspicious file operations, script execution with bypassed policies, and potential registry tampering—it's likely an attack. The confidence here is high because multiple red flags align with common attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including Powershell script execution, file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, and registry modifications which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
