The only outlier is an event where the process is null, task is Security Group Management, and no file path is provided. However, without more context on that specific event, it's hard to assess its significance, but it doesn't seem immediately suspicious.\n\nGiven that most events are from a legitimate Microsoft process and involve expected file operations, there's little indication of malicious behavior.

Each event is a JSON object indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in specific paths. Notably, all these files are under the same directory structure and have similar names, varying only by their suffixes.\n\nFirst off, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiarâ€”it's often associated with Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, which are legitimate components used to extend Office functionality. These packages can include various resources like JavaScript files for add-ins or language strings.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the \"OfflineFiles\" folder. This suggests that these might be cached or stored offline copies of some Office-related assets. The fact that multiple .js files are being created isn't unusual during normal operation when Office is installing or updating its components, especially if there are language packs or add-ins involved.\n\nEach event shows a file creation, and the same process is responsible for all these actions. There's no indication of any other activity like deletions, access attempts, or modifications that could hint at malicious behavior. The repetitive nature of creating these files might seem suspicious at first glance, but in this context, it aligns with legitimate Office operations.\n\nI also consider whether the creation of so many files within a short period is abnormal. While unusual, without more context about what's normal for this system, it's hard to say definitively. However, given that they're all under an expected directory and are standard file types, it leans towards benign activity.\n\nNo other events in the log suggest anomalies such as failed attempts, access from unauthorized sources, or deviations from typical user behavior. The uniformity of the events without any signs of failure or unexpected patterns further supports the idea that this is part of normal Office operations.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these points, I don't see evidence that suggests malicious intent.

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event from the system logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events are coming from \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task associated with these is \"File created\", and they're all creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData folder. The paths look like they're for Office Solution Packages, specifically related to OfflineFiles and some JS strings.\n\nLooking at the file paths more closely, each entry has a unique hash-like string in the filename, such as \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_4dd86f6b38e03fc03eecefd5fa19f188.js\" and others. These seem like different versions or perhaps different chunks of the same file being created multiple times.\n\nThere are a few other events too, like two entries from \"chrome.exe\" where it's setting registry values. Those might be normal browser activity, but they're in the minority compared to the SDXHelper events.\n\nNow, considering that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is related to Microsoft Office, these file creations could be part of normal operations, especially if the user is working with offline files or packages in Office. The repeated creation of similar-named JS files might indicate some processing happening in the background, maybe related to loading resources for AI features like Copilot.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual processes or access patterns that would raise red flags. All activities are confined to expected locations within the user's profile and relate to known Office components. The fact that multiple identical file creation events occur might be due to retries or parallel processing, which isn't uncommon in software updates or resource loading.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the volume of events is significant, they don't indicate any malicious behavior. They appear to be part of legitimate operations by a known Microsoft-related process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal file creation activities by a legitimate Office-related process, SDXHelper.exe, and do not indicate any malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object representing some system activity. The first thing I notice is that all the events seem to be related to file creation tasks performed by different processes.\n\nThe process names vary between \"SDXHelper.exe\" and \"svchost.exe\". \"SVCHOST.exe\" is a common Windows process, often associated with services, so it's not immediately suspicious. However, multiple instances of \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files caught my attention. This might indicate some activity from that particular process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office. Specifically, these are offline files for \"officeaicopilot\". The filenames are variations of JavaScript files with different hashes in their names. This repetition makes me think about how many similar files are being created by this process.\n\nConsidering that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is linked to Microsoft Office's AI Copilot feature, the creation of multiple JS files could be part of normal operation when downloading or caching resources for the AI features. However, the high number of such events in a short time might still be worth looking into. It raises questions about whether this is expected behavior or if it's related to some other activity, possibly malicious.\n\nI'm also noticing that there are several duplicate file paths listed, which could suggest that the same file is being created multiple times. This repetition might not be typical in a standard environment and could indicate an issue with the process or potential tampering.\n\nOn the other hand, since these activities are occurring within known Microsoft Office directories and involve processes that are part of legitimate software (like Office's AI features), it's less likely to be malicious. However, the volume of file creation events is notable enough that it might warrant further investigation to ensure there isn't an underlying issue or unauthorized activity.\n\nIn summary, while these activities don't clearly point to malicious behavior, they're also not entirely typical and could indicate a problem with the software or an attempt to manipulate files in a way that's unusual.

The fact that multiple files are being created doesn't immediately raise red flags, as it could be part of normal operations, especially during updates or when syncing data offline.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\", which suggests these are resources related to an Office add-in or package. The filenames include terms like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by varying hashes. This seems consistent with how software packages cache their files for local access, especially in scenarios where online resources aren't available.\n\nI don't see any indicators of malicious activity here. There's no evidence of file deletion, unauthorized access, or changes to system configurations. All events are straightforward file creations without unusual timestamps or repeated failed attempts that might indicate something suspicious like brute force attacks.\n\nConsidering the frequency and repetition, it might be a bit concerning if this happened once, but seeing multiple entries over time could just be part of a legitimate process. Since all actions originate from the same process and target expected locations within the user's profile, there's no sign of unusual permissions or lateral movement typical in an attack.\n\nIn conclusion, while I'd want to monitor for deviations from this pattern in the future, based on the information provided, these events don't indicate any malicious behavior.

The filenames are different, but they follow a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by various hashes. These look like JavaScript files.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries creating the same files: for example, the first file path is repeated twice, and others also appear more than once.

That makes sense because Excel often creates and deletes these temp files when you open or save documents. So those events alone don't raise any red flags.\n\nThere are also several entries from svchost.exe modifying the registry. SvcHost is a common system process that hosts other services, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry. The fact that there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks might just be part of regular system operations, like service configuration changes or updates.\n\nAnother thing I notice is SDXHelper.exe creating some files in the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. This seems related to Office add-ins or customization packages. These files look like JavaScript resources, which could be part of some UI elements or language packs. Unless these are unexpected or known malicious scripts, this might just be normal Office behavior.\n\nLooking through all the events, I don't see anything overtly suspicious like failed logins, unusual file accesses, or processes that shouldn't be running. The main activities are Excel operations and system service interactions, which are pretty typical on a user's machine.\n\nI also check if there are any repeated or unusual patterns. For example, multiple FileCreate events from SDXHelper.exe could indicate something is being unpacked, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, considering the other normal activities and no signs of errors or anomalies, this doesn't point towards malicious behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are several entries that might look unusual at first glance, they all seem to fit within typical user activity on a system.

Let me parse the logs:\n\n1. **chrome.exe** loaded an image (MpClient.dll), which is associated with Windows Defender. That seems normal because chrome might interact with defender components for security purposes.\n2. **SDXHelper.exe** created a file in Office's SolutionPackages directory. The path looks like it's related to Office add-ins or AI features, maybe Copilot. This also seems legitimate as part of Office functionality.\n3. Another instance from SDXHelper creating the same file again. Not sure if duplication is an issue or just multiple writes.\n4-6. chrome.exe setting registry values three times. Registry modifications can be a red flag but in this case, they're coming from chrome, which might be adjusting settings for security features or updates.\n7-8. SDXHelper creating two more files with similar paths and filenames. It's the same pattern as before, so likely part of normal Office operations.\n\n9-10. chrome.exe interacting with a file named Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx in Downloads. The task is either File stream created or File created. This could be opening or saving an Excel file from Chrome.\n11-14. Multiple events around the same xlsx file, including creating streams and possibly dealing with Zone.Identifier, which is related to marking files as coming from the internet (like Office's 'Mark of the Web'). This process seems standard when handling downloads.\n\n15. Another SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the same directory. Consistent with previous entries.\n16-17. More events from chrome.exe regarding the xlsx file, including more registry value sets.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about whether these activities indicate anything suspicious. \n\n- **File Creation by Known Processes:** Chrome and Office helpers are common processes. The files created in their respective directories seem legitimate (e.g., MpClient.dll for Defender, OfflineFiles for Office add-ins).\n- **Registry Modifications:** chrome.exe setting registry values isn't unusual; it might be adjusting security settings or update configurations.\n- **Excel File Handling:** Opening an Excel file from Chrome is normal. The multiple interactions with the xlsx and Zone.Identifier streams are typical when dealing with downloaded files, especially if they have macros or need to be marked as trusted.\n\nI don't see any anomalies like:\n- Executable files being created in unexpected locations.\n- Processes accessing restricted areas without reason.\n- Unusual network traffic or DNS queries pointing to malicious domains.\n- Sudden spikes in failed logins or other signs of brute-force attacks.\n\nThe user mentioned considering the entire batch as a whole, and all events here seem related to normal user activitiesâ€”browsing with Chrome, using Office features, handling downloaded files.

The first few entries are all from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in various locations like OfflineFiles with different .js filenames. I notice that some of these paths repeat, which might indicate that SDXHelper is just downloading or updating some resources, possibly related to language translations since the filenames have locale codes like 'ar-sa' and 'en-us'.\n\nThen there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" creating files in a temporary directory under AppData. The file names like 1680A406.xlsx suggest Excel is working on a spreadsheet. There's also a Zone.Identifier stream, which I recall is related to handling files downloaded from the internet, marking them as coming from the internet (ZONE1) to trigger certain security settings.\n\nAdditionally, EXCEL.EXE is loading some system DLLs and VBA-related files. That seems normal because Excel would need these components for functionality.\n\nSo putting it all together: SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files in an Office Solution Packages directory, which sounds like legitimate software behaviorâ€”maybe part of Office add-ins or updates. EXCEL.EXE is just doing its usual thing, handling a spreadsheet and loading necessary modules.\n\nThere's no indication of any unauthorized access, unusual processes, or signs of malicious activity like unexpected file creation from unknown executables or attempts to access restricted areas.

Each line is a JSON object, and there are several entries here. My job is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, let's look at what each event contains. There are multiple events with the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" performing file creation tasks. These files all have paths under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory, specifically in OfflineFiles. The filenames are variations of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" with different hashes or identifiers. This repetition suggests that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating multiple small files, possibly related to some application's resource files.\n\nThen there are a couple of events from \"chrome.exe\". One is loading the urlmon.dll, which seems normal for Chrome since it's handling URLs and might be part of its standard operation. The other event is about setting a registry value, which could indicate some configuration change but isn't immediately suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the Downloads directory, specifically \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for log collection, so this seems like it's just setting up its configuration file. Nothing unusual there.\n\nAnother entry is from EXCEL.EXE opening a specific Excel file and loading some system DLLs, which again looks like standard behavior when using Excel.\n\nNow, looking at the \"SDXHelper.exe\" events more closely: The same process is creating multiple files in the OfflineFiles folder. Since this is part of Microsoft Office's setup or updates, it could be related to downloading resources for an add-in or a feature that requires offline access. However, the fact that so many identical files are being created might indicate something suspicious, like a potential file injection attack or malicious script generation.\n\nBut wait, I should consider the possibility that these files are legitimate parts of Office's update mechanism. Microsoft Office often updates its components and may download several resource files for new features or languages. In that case, multiple similar files wouldn't be unusual. However, the exact naming convention with \"min\" suffixes suggests they might be minified scripts, which could mean they're part of a web-based component.\n\nAnother angle: If these files are being created rapidly or in large numbers, it could indicate an issue like a ransomware encryption attempt, where files are being generated as part of the encryption process. Alternatively, it might be a sign of malicious script generation or dropper activity that's creating temporary files to execute some payload.\n\nOn the other hand, if these are legitimate Office updates, they wouldn't pose a threat. But without more context on whether this activity is expected or not, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nConsidering all events together, there isn't any clear indication of malicious behavior beyond the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe. However, the repetition and specific naming might raise some flags for further investigation. It's possible that these files are part of a legitimate update process, but they could also be indicators of something more nefarious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while most events seem normal, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe is worth looking into to ensure it's not malicious.

That seems normal as part of log shipping or configuration.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from SDXHelper.exe creating files with specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. These look like typical operations when Office packages update their resources or cache files. The file names include JavaScript and JSON strings, which are standard for web-based content within Office add-ins or similar solutions. The repetition of the same process and identical file paths might indicate a routine background activity, perhaps related to updates or language package installations.\n\nThen there are events from Explorer.EXE modifying registry values. This is common as part of system operations, application launches, or configuration changes. Registry modifications can be frequent, especially during user logins or when software starts up.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE entries also show several registry value sets. Microsoft Office applications often interact with the registry to store settings, so this activity aligns with typical behavior. Additionally, there's an event where Excel creates a shortcut file in the Recent folder, which is normal for tracking recently opened documents.\n\nLooking at all events together, most activities are standard system and application operations. The repetition of certain processes (like multiple writes by SDXHelper.exe) might raise suspicion if they were unusual, but given the context of resource caching or updates, it's likely benign. There's no indication of failed operations, access to sensitive files, or unexpected locations that would signal malicious behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of privilege escalation, encrypted communications, or attempts to execute code. The file creations and registry modifications are within expected directories for their respective processes.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of events where the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the task is \"Registry value set\". So Excel is modifying some registry values. I know that legitimate software often makes changes to the Windows Registry when it runs or updates settings. But multiple instances in a row might raise an eyebrow, but on its own, this doesn't seem too suspicious yet.\n\nThen, towards the end of the logs, there are two events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". The tasks here are \"File created\", and the file paths look like they're within the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. Specifically, the files being created are JavaScript files related to Office, like \"office_2e97d65336bd5d3533e966e9de09077e.js\" and \"office_strings_247f8f78dd7820085808b5e8fec39119.js\". \n\nI'm thinking about what SDXHelper.exe does. From what I recall, it's a legitimate Microsoft tool used for managing Office add-ins and solution packages. So the creation of files in that directory by this process is normal during updates or installations of Office solutions.\n\nPutting it all together: the Excel events might just be regular operation, especially if someone is using Excel heavily. The SDXHelper.exe creating files seems standard as well. There's no indication of any malicious activity like access to unusual paths, multiple failed attempts, or other red flags. So I don't see anything here that stands out as suspicious.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level. Since all events seem within normal operations and there's nothing irregular in their timestamps or frequencies, my confidence is high that this batch isn't interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show normal activities with Excel modifying registry values and SDXHelper.exe creating files related to Microsoft Office solutions.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of JSONL events where each line represents an event. The common element across all these events is the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" and the task being \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". Each event also specifies a file path under the same user directory, with various locale-specific files being created.\n\nFirst, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office's Solution Package Installer. This tool is used to install and manage language packs or add-ins for Office applications. The repeated creation of files in the OfflineFiles folder suggests that these are likely string resource files for different languages (like da-dk for Danish, de-de for German, etc.).\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all fall under the same parent directory within the user's AppData Local folder. This is typical behavior for Office-related processes managing language resources or updates.\n\nI also note that multiple events are creating the same files. For instance, \"da-dk-ui-strings-json_fa00023250e8153fbf752c006316dd22.js\" appears twice. This duplication might be due to the process attempting to write these files multiple times or perhaps it's part of a retry mechanism if the initial attempt fails.\n\nConsidering potential malicious activity, I think about what indicators would suggest something suspicious. If SDXHelper.exe were involved in malicious behavior, we'd likely see it accessing unusual file paths, interacting with unexpected network locations, or writing to system areas rather than user-specific folders. However, all these events are confined to the user's local directory and involve standard operations for language package management.\n\nAdditionally, there's no evidence of other activities typically associated with malware, such as changes to system settings, execution of scripts in unusual places, or attempts to access restricted resources. The consistent nature of the process name and task, along with the predictable file paths, aligns with legitimate Office operations.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor for any deviations from normal behavior, especially repeated writes, this batch doesn't present a clear indication of malicious activity. It seems more like a routine operation by Microsoft Office components managing their language resources.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions performed by SDXHelper.exe, which is related to Microsoft Office's language pack installation.

This duplication makes me think it's part of a normal process, maybe during an update or installation where files are being copied over again.\n\nThe locations of these files seem standard for Office-related resources. They're in the OfflineFiles folder under SolutionPackages, which is typical for software that might need localized strings stored offline. The file extensions are .js, which aligns with JavaScript resource files used for user interface strings.\n\nThere's one event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, but that's expected behavior for log management tools. It doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nConsidering all these points, the activity appears to be related to legitimate Office operations.

SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar; it's often associated with Microsoft Office, specifically handling updates and package resources. These events show multiple file creations of .js files which seem to be localized strings for the UI.\n\nI should check if these activities are typical or part of normal operations.

I'm looking at a batch of system log events where the same process, SDXHelper.exe, is creating multiple files in specific locations. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe does. It sounds familiar; I think it's related to Microsoft Office, possibly handling updates or package resources. The file paths are all within the AppData directory under Microsoft\/Office\/SolutionPackages. That makes sense for an application component that might be managing offline files or language packs.\n\nLooking at the events, each one is a \"File created\" task by SDXHelper.exe. The file paths point to various JSON and JS resources, some named after languages like hr-hr, hu-hu, hy-am, etc., which suggests these are localized strings for different regions. There's also a Fabric.js file, which I recall is used in web development for UI components, so that fits with Office's interface elements.\n\nI notice that many of the same files are being created multiple times. For example, icon_built_in_svg_icon...js appears twice, as do several language strings. This repetition might indicate normal caching or reinstallation of resources, which is typical during software updates or initial setup.\n\nNow, considering whether this is interesting from a security perspective: SDXHelper.exe's activity here doesn't raise any red flags. Creating files in these locations is part of its legitimate operation. The paths aren't suspiciousâ€”no signs of being in user folders outside the expected areas or executing code that shouldn't be there.\n\nI also think about whether multiple writes are common for this process. Since it's dealing with package resources and possibly language files, creating several files at once or repeatedly makes sense for an application trying to set up its environment correctly, especially after updates or installations.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these events look like standard operations by a legitimate Microsoft Office component. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or attempts to write to unexpected locations. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show SDXHelper.exe creating files in expected Microsoft Office package directories, which is normal behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. The first thing I notice is that there are 23 entries, all appearing to be Windows log events. The majorityâ€”19 out of these 23â€”are from \"EXCEL.EXE\" setting registry values multiple times. That seems repetitive but not necessarily suspicious on its own; Excel might just be configuring settings during runtime.\n\nHowever, the first event stands out because it's from \"SDXHelper.exe\" and involves a file creation in a specific path: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\...\\ko-kr-ui-strings-json_6546bdae687a15e8c955ff2a889910a5.js\". SDXHelper.exe isn't a commonly known process, and file creation in the Office Solution Packages directory could indicate some form of software installation or update. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe repeated registry writes from Excel are concerning because writing to the registry multiple times can sometimes be a sign of malicious activity, like installing persistent malware. However, legitimate applications also modify the registry frequently during setup or operation. So while it's something to look into, it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nCombined, these two activitiesâ€”unusual file creation and repeated registry modificationsâ€”could warrant further investigation. The volume of registry writes might indicate a potential issue, especially if they're all happening in such a short timeframe. It's possible that this could be part of an attack vector attempting to modify system configurations or install components without proper authorization.\n\nIn summary, while each event individually isn't strongly indicative of malicious behavior, the combination raises some red flags. The unusual file creation and the excessive registry writes from Excel could be signs of something more serious. Therefore, I would classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a combination of events including multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE and a file creation by SDXHelper.exe in an Office-related path.

My task is to determine if this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are entries where \"SDXHelper.exe\" creates files in specific paths. The file paths all point to different language resources under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. Each entry shows that a .js file is being created with various locale codes like 'it-it', 'ja-jp', etc. It seems repetitive, as many of these events are duplicatesâ€”same process name and similar file paths.\n\nThen there's an event from \"EXCEL.EXE\" querying DNS and making registry changes. That caught my eye a bit because Excel isn't typically involved in DNS queries, unless it's part of some legitimate functionality, but it's worth noting. Registry modifications can be suspicious if they're unexpected or frequent.\n\nThe last few entries are from \"svchost.exe\", which is a common Windows process that often runs as a host for services. The events show registry object additions\/deletions and value sets. Since svchost is legitimate, these actions alone might not be concerning unless there's unusual activity or multiple such events happening.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of the logs are SDXHelper.exe creating files, which seems related to Office language packs or updates. These are probably normal operations, especially if they're happening during an update or configuration change. The EXCEL.EXE DNS query and registry changes could be part of legitimate software behavior but might also indicate something malicious if they're not expected. Similarly, svchost's activity is standard unless it's part of a known attack vector.\n\nI don't see any clear signs of malicious activity here. All the events seem to fall within normal operational parameters for these processes. The repetition of file creations suggests it's a bulk operation, possibly during an update or installation. Unless there are other indicators like timestamps clustering together in a suspicious way or unusual file hashes, this batch doesn't raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, my classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities don't exhibit signs of malicious behavior when considered as a whole.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation and registry operations by legitimate processes.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. I've got a batch of JSONL events here that I need to analyze as a whole. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all seem similar. There are five events where the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the Windows log task is \"Registry value set.\" Then, starting from the 6th event onwards, the process changes to \"SDXHelper.exe,\" and the tasks involve creating files in specific paths.\n\nI know that EXCEL.EXE doing registry writes isn't unusual. Excel often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings. But seeing multiple such events in a row might be worth looking intoâ€”maybe it's normal or maybe there's something else going on, like a script or malicious process using Excel to modify the registry repeatedly.\n\nThen, moving on to SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this exe, so I should think about what it does. From the file paths provided, they seem to be related to Microsoft Office package resources and JavaScript files for UI strings. This looks like part of the Office setup or updates, where helper processes create necessary files.\n\nThe repeated creation of these files in the same locations might not be suspicious on its own. It could just be that the system is performing routine updates or configurations. However, the frequency hereâ€”multiple entries creating the same filesâ€”is something to note. If this were part of a legitimate update process, it's possible they're being written multiple times due to retries or different processes handling them.\n\nBut wait, the first set of events with Excel modifying the registry could be more concerning. Registry modifications are common but can also be indicators of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms. Five such events in a row might suggest that something is iterating through and making changes, which isn't typical for normal Excel usage. This could be a sign of potential malware or unauthorized access.\n\nOn the other hand, if these registry writes are part of a legitimate process, maybe an Office add-in or macro running in Excel, then they wouldn't be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe confidence here is moderate because while the activity isn't clearly malicious, there's enough unusual behavior to warrant further investigation. The combination of multiple registry writes by Excel and repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe could indicate either normal operations or something more nefarious.\n\nI should also consider the number of events. There are 14 entries in total, with a lot of repetition. Such repetitive actions might be part of a script or automated process, which is another red flag if not explained by legitimate activity.\n\nIn summary, while some parts could be normal, the overall pattern raises enough questions to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by EXCEL.EXE and SDXHelper.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
