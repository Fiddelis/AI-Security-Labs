Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze this entire batch as a whole and determine whether it's relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that all the events have similar structures. Each one includes information about a process named \"git.exe,\" a Windows log entry indicating a file creation (rule: FileCreate), and a file path pointing to various .d.ts files under the node_modules directory of a user's folder.\n\nI know that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The file paths are all within a node_modules folder, which suggests this is part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project setup. The specific files being created (like findLastFrom.d.ts and first.d.ts) seem to be TypeScript declaration files for lodash functions.\n\nSince these events all relate to the creation of files during a git operation in a development context, it doesn't raise any immediate red flags. There's no indication of unusual or malicious activity such as multiple failed login attempts, access to restricted areas, or unexpected process executions. Instead, this looks like normal file operations that occur when setting up or updating project dependencies.\n\nHowever, I should consider the possibility of a more insidious attack where an adversary might use legitimate processes for malicious purposes. But in this case, git.exe is performing standard tasks related to file creation in a typical development setup. There's no evidence of any deviation from expected behavior.\n\nAnother angle to think about is whether these files being created are part of a known malicious payload or if they're intended to modify system configurations. The presence of .d.ts files in node_modules suggests they are type definitions for the Lodash library, which is a common and trusted utility library in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. No signs here indicate any tampering or injection.\n\nI also note that all events happened from the same user account (fiddelis) and within the same directory structure. This consistency further supports the idea that this is normal development activity rather than malicious behavior.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure these are not indicative of an attack. However, I can't be 100% certain without more context, like whether the user was performing expected tasks at the time or if there were other concurrent events that could suggest otherwise. But based on the given data alone, there's nothing to investigate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows normal file creation activities during a git operation in a development environment, specifically creating TypeScript declaration files for a project.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\". The task in the winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means a file was created. The file paths all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" and each ends with different .d.ts files, like invokeArgs.d.ts, invokeArgsMap.d.ts, isArray.d.ts, and so on. There are 14 such events in total.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about what git.exe does. Git is a version control system, commonly used for managing source code. When you run git commands, it can create or update files related to the project's dependencies or structure. In this case, all the file paths are under node_modules, which suggests these are part of a Node.js project. The cypress folder indicates that Cypress is being used as a testing framework, and lodash is a popular JavaScript library.\n\nSo each event shows git.exe creating a file in the types directory of the lodash fp module within the Cypress setup. This seems normal because when you install or update dependencies using npm or yarn, it's common for files to be created or modified in node_modules. Especially since .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files, which are part of the type definitions for modules.\n\nI'm wondering if there's anything unusual here. Git.exe is not typically associated with malicious activities; it's more about source control. If an attacker gains access, they might use other tools or methods, but git itself isn't a red flag in this context. The file creations are within expected locations for project dependencies, so there doesn't seem to be any indication of unauthorized file operations or signs of malware.\n\nAnother angle is considering the number of events. There are 14 files being created by git.exe in quick succession. If these were spread out over time, it might raise an eyebrow, but in a development environment, installing dependencies can create multiple files at once, especially during an npm install command.\n\nI also think about log analysis for security—looking for anomalies. But here, all events are consistent with each other: same process name, same task type, and file paths that fit into the project's structure. There’s no variation in the process or file names, which could indicate different activities or potential malicious scripts creating various files.\n\nFurthermore, if this was part of a larger attack, I would expect to see other events like network connections, changes to system configurations, or access to sensitive files. But all these are just standard file creations in a typical development setup.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows git.exe creating several .d.ts files within a node_modules directory as part of a Cypress project. This is normal behavior for a development environment using Node.js and Git for version control. There's no evidence of malicious activity or anything out of the ordinary here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates that multiple TypeScript declaration files are being created under a Node.js project structure, which is typical during dependency installations.

I'm looking at a batch of events where the same process, git.exe, is creating multiple files in a specific directory.

The fact that all these events are from the same process suggests they're part of a single operation, probably during a git command execution.\n\nNext, the file paths point to TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) in the node_modules directory. This is typical when npm packages are installed or updated because npm often creates or modifies type definitions for modules. Cypress and lodash are well-known libraries, so their types shouldn't be suspicious on their own.\n\nI'm also considering whether these activities could indicate malicious behavior. While it's true that attackers might abuse legitimate tools, in this case, the consistent naming and structure of the files don't raise red flags. There's no indication of unusual file names, locations outside the expected modules folder, or attempts to execute code beyond what's typical for npm module setup.\n\nThe uniformity across all events—same process name, same task type, similar file paths—points towards routine system operations rather than anything nefarious. If there were signs like multiple processes accessing the same files, unusual access times, or creation of hidden files, that might warrant closer investigation. But as it stands, everything aligns with expected behavior during a git operation in a development environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the events are likely part of a normal software development process, specifically related to setting up project dependencies.

The paths are all .d.ts files, which I know are TypeScript declaration files, commonly used in projects with TypeScript support. Since these are part of the node_modules, it's likely that this is during a development or setup process where dependencies are being installed or updated.\n\nNow, considering whether this is interesting for investigation. Git is often used in development environments, so creating files in node_modules makes sense when installing npm packages. The fact that all events are similar and come from the same source suggests it's part of a normal software build or update process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file paths, no executable files being created, just standard TypeScript declarations for a testing framework like Cypress. There's also consistency in the timestamps; since they're all sequential and close together, it seems like a single operation rather than multiple unrelated events.\n\nThe user is probably working on their software project, installing or updating dependencies.

This suggests that these events are related to file creation activities monitored by some security tool or system.\n\nThe file paths provided all point to different `.d.ts` files within a directory structure under `node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/`. These are TypeScript declaration files, which are typically used in TypeScript projects to provide type information for modules. The fact that they're being created by `git.exe` makes me think this might be part of a repository's commit process or perhaps an operation related to version control.\n\nI'm considering the context here. Since these files are part of a development environment, especially with Cypress and Lodash being common tools in web development, it's not unusual for such file operations to occur during normal development workflows. `git.exe` is often used to clone repositories, pull updates, or commit changes, which would involve creating new files or updating existing ones.\n\nNow, from a security standpoint, I'm wondering if these events could indicate malicious activity. Malware or attackers might create files as part of their operations, but the pattern here seems too consistent and related to a legitimate process (`git.exe`) in a development environment. The file paths are specific to a project's structure, which doesn't raise any red flags about them being dropped by malicious software.\n\nAnother angle is whether these events could be part of an attack vector. For example, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for their activities to blend in with normal traffic. However, the nature of these files and their location within `node_modules` suggests they're part of a package installation or update process, which is standard during development.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether there's any unusual volume here. If multiple file creation events are happening rapidly, it might indicate something suspicious. But without context on the frequency or timing relative to other activities, it's hard to say. The logs provided don't show an abnormal number of such events beyond what would be expected during a git operation.\n\nAdditionally, considering the user involved (the path starts with `C:\\Users\\fiddelis`), if this user is known within the organization and these actions are part of their normal duties (like a developer), then there's even less reason to suspect foul play.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious, the combination of process (`git.exe`), task type (file creation), and file paths pointing to development tools suggests that this batch of events is likely part of standard operations rather than malicious activity.

Each one is a JSON object, and they all seem to be related to file creation events on a Windows system. The process name in each event is \"git.exe\", which suggests that Git is being used here. \n\nThe files being created are all under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" and they have different filenames like trim.d.ts, trimEnd.d.ts, etc. These look like TypeScript definition files for Lodash functions. \n\nI know that Git is commonly used in development environments for version control. The node_modules folder suggests that this is a Node.js project, which aligns with using Cypress for testing. So it seems like someone is working on a software project where they're installing or updating dependencies.\n\nLooking at the events, each one is a file creation by git.exe. It's normal during development to have Git create files when cloning repositories, pulling updates, or extracting archives. The fact that multiple files are being created in sequence under the node_modules folder indicates that this might be part of an npm install process, where dependencies are being downloaded and extracted.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no evidence of unusual file paths, attempts to execute scripts, or access to sensitive areas outside the project directory. All the files are within a standard project structure related to a software development environment.\n\nThe repetition of similar events with different filenames but the same parent path and process suggests automation during the build or setup phase of a project. This is a common occurrence in CI\/CD pipelines or when developers set up their environments.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's likely just part of normal software development activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation during a Git process within a Node.js project directory, indicating normal development activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
