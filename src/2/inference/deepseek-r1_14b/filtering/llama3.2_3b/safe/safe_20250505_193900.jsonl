{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common system process, so that's not unusual. Next, Explorer.EXE also sets a registry value. Again, standard behavior since Windows uses it for various tasks.\n\nThere's an event with no process and task as None, which might be noise but nothing to worry about. Then chrome.exe setting a registry value multiple times. Chrome is known to make such changes, so that's expected unless there's something unusual in the context.\n\nOne of the chrome.exe events creates a pipe, another makes a DNS query, and another loads taskschd.dll. These are typical activities for Chrome—pipes for inter-process communication, DNS queries for navigation, and loading system DLLs for functionality.\n\nAnother event is svchost.exe detecting a network connection, which could be normal or related to malware checking for command-and-control servers. But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThe last chrome.exe events involve creating pipes again and loading taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler—something Chrome might use for extensions or background tasks.\n\nOverall, most activities are standard system and browser operations. The network connection from svchost could be a red flag, but it's isolated. Without more malicious indicators across the batch, I'm leaning towards not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system and application activities such as registry modifications by svchost.exe, Explorer.EXE, and chrome.exe, network connection detection, and loading standard system files. There are no signs of unusual or malicious behavior in the provided batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
