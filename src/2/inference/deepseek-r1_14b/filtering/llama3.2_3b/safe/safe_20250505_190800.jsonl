{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, there are multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event from system logs. My goal is to analyze all these together and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's a process creation of powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note. Then there are several ImageLoad events for different DLLs. These could be normal as PowerShell loads various libraries, but sometimes attackers might load malicious modules.\n\nNext, I see a file being created in the Temp directory with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest... That seems suspicious because it looks like it's trying to bypass script policy tests. Attackers often use such techniques to execute scripts without triggering certain security measures. Then, this file is deleted shortly after, which might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThere's also a pipe created by PowerShell. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, but in some cases, they've been exploited for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking further, another file is created in the Downloads folder named teste.ps1. That's a script which could either be benign or malicious depending on its content. The fact that it was executed with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass suggests an attempt to run scripts that are otherwise blocked by default policies, which is a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process access event and more ImageLoad events for known DLLs. However, the Registry value set stands out because attackers often modify registry entries to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show a sequence of actions that could be indicative of malicious behavior. The combination of creating temporary scripts, bypassing execution policies, deleting files, and accessing the registry is consistent with techniques used in attacks. While some activities might be legitimate, the overall pattern raises concerns about potential compromise or suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell process creations, file operations in Temp directory resembling script policy testing, and execution with bypass of execution policies. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
