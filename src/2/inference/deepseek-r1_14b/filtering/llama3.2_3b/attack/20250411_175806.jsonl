{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal because it's often used just to check the user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is accessed. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious, but accessing it without any unusual commands doesn't raise flags here.\n\nThen, cmd.exe runs with a command that adds a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. The path points to C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe. Registry additions like this can be part of legitimate software installations or persistence mechanisms for malware. I need to consider if this is expected behavior.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event writes another registry value, this time adding HKCU with a different entry pointing to pacote_temporario.exe. Again, using reg.exe for modifying the registry could be normal but might indicate some script execution.\n\nConhost.exe is next, which is often used as a host for other processes and not inherently malicious unless it's part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere are multiple instances where powershell.exe and cmd.exe access or modify the registry. This repetition suggests possible scripting or automated behavior, which could be suspicious if done in rapid succession or with uncommon commands.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management, so this event seems benign unless there's an irregularity in how it's being used here.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several cmd and reg.exe processes modifying the registry to add entries that point to .exe files. This pattern could be part of a persistence mechanism where malware ensures it runs on each user login. The repeated use of these commands might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or spread malicious activities across different processes, which raises concern about potential malicious intent.\n\nHowever, without more context like the exact paths and whether these executables are legitimate or known malicious, it's hard to be certain. But considering the combination of registry modifications by multiple command-line tools, the batch as a whole is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of cmd.exe and reg.exe modifying the Windows Registry, potentially indicating persistence mechanisms or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
