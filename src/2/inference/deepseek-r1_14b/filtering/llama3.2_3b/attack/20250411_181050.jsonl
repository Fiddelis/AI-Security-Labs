{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving process creations and accesses, like whoami.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and certutil.exe. Notably, the command lines show that some processes are using certutil to encode and decode files. For instance, calc.exe is being used in a path with 'encode' and 'decode' operations. This could be suspicious because I know that legitimate system tools like certutil can sometimes be misused for malicious purposes, such as encoding malicious code into benign files.\n\nAnother point is the use of rundll32.exe calling PcaSvc.dll. That might not look immediately suspicious, but PcaSvc is related to Windows Patching and could be a target for attackers trying to execute arbitrary code if compromised.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a creation of .exe files in temporary directories by certutil. The names like 'modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe' and 'estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe' stand out because they suggest code is being decoded or compiled from some encoded form, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes might indicate an attacker using PowerShell for tasks that require more elevated privileges or for executing scripts. PowerShell is often used in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities and access to system functions.\n\nThere are several registry writes by chrome.exe, which seems unusual because Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry frequently unless there's some malicious extension or script doing so. This could be a red flag if these changes aren't explained by normal browser operations.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using certutil for encoding\/decoding files, rundll32 with PcaSvc, multiple process creations and accesses, and unusual registry modifications points towards potential malicious activity. The repeated use of certain tools in ways that don't align with typical user behavior increases my confidence that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including the use of certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding files, creation of executable files in temporary directories, and unusual process creations.
