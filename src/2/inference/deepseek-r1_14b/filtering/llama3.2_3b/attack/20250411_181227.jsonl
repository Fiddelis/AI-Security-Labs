{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events where PowerShell is being executed with commands that create scheduled tasks. The command lines show the creation of new scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`, which is a bit concerning because adversaries often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. Each scheduled task is set to execute calc.exe at logon, which seems suspicious because calc.exe isn't typically used in such contextsâ€”it's more of a common payload in attacks.\n\nNext, I notice that some events are categorized under 'Provider Lifecycle' and involve tasks related to process creation or image loading by PowerShell. This could indicate the script is doing something more complex, possibly loading modules or components which might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where files are being created and then deleted in temporary directories. The file paths point to `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`, and the filenames have random-looking names with `.ps1` extensions. This suggests that PowerShell scripts might be downloading or executing malicious code, which is a red flag because it's a common technique for persistence or execution of payload.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry changes detected, which could be part of establishing persistence mechanisms. Modifying the registry to execute commands on startup is a classic method used by attackers.\n\nLooking at the events involving Chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying registry values, this might seem less suspicious at first glance, but considering that other processes like PowerShell are showing malicious behavior, it's possible Chrome is being exploited or part of a lateral movement.\n\nThe event where a remote command was executed without any file path also stands out. This could indicate an attempt to execute code directly over the network, which is another indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting all these together, the pattern suggests that an attacker might be using PowerShell to create persistent scheduled tasks, possibly dropping and then deleting malicious scripts in temporary directories, and making changes to the system's configuration to maintain access. The combination of multiple suspicious events across different processes and files indicates a coordinated attack rather than isolated incidents.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe, file operations in temporary directories, registry changes, and a remote command execution. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This could indicate remote execution, which might be malicious. But then I look at the other fields: process and file paths. In these cases, both 'process' and 'file' are None. That makes me think these events are generic or possibly false positives since they lack specific details.\n\nNext, there's an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll. WmiPrvSE is a legitimate process used for remote management. The file path seems normal too, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I see svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks folder. Svchost is a common system process, and creating files there could be part of normal operations, especially if it's related to scheduled tasks.\n\nThe powershell.exe entries are interesting because they're associated with creating files and modifying registry values. Powershell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. However, the specific file paths here look like standard locations (e.g., PowerShell StartupProfileData). This could be normal user profile initialization, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThere are also events where conhost.exe sets registry values. Conhost is another Windows process that can be used for command-line interactions. The lack of a file path makes this less specific, but it's not necessarily malicious unless combined with other indicators.\n\nChrome.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Defender Platform doesn't raise red flags. This seems related to virus scanning and should be normal.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating configuration files in its own directory is expected behavior if that's the tool being used for log management. The .yml file might just be a new configuration setup, which isn't unusual.\n\nThe creation of two text files by powershell.exe could be part of data gathering or legitimate scripting. Without seeing the content, it's hard to say, but they're named 'entrada_principal.txt' and 'objeto_auxiliar.txt', which don't immediately sound suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together: there are several events that involve potentially high-risk processes like powershell.exe and remote command executions, but many of these lack specific malicious indicators. The repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no additional details might be noise or part of automated scripts. While some activities could indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration, the evidence isn't conclusive without more context.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as NOT INTERESTING because while there are red flags, they aren't strong enough without further info to justify an active investigation. However, I should note that powershell.exe and remote command executions might warrant closer monitoring in the future.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events with generic tasks like 'Execute a Remote Command' and normal system processes creating files or registry entries. No clear indicators of malicious activity emerge when considering all events together.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
