{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, most of the events are related to powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The tasks include Image loads and Registry value sets, which could indicate script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI notice several instances where files are being created and deleted in temporary directories, like the FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events. This might suggest that some code is being written temporarily, possibly malicious scripts trying to avoid detection by deleting themselves after execution.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event for whoami.exe, which is often used to check user permissions or privileges. If this is executed in a script context, it could be part of privilege escalation tactics.\n\nAdditionally, multiple RegistryEvent tasks show that powershell is modifying the registry. This can be a red flag because attackers often set registry values to create persistence points for malware.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one event shows a specific script removing a .zip file from the TEMP directory. Deleting files in temporary directories might be an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence of malicious activities.\n\nThe combination of these events—multiple powershell executions, file creation\/deletion in temp folders, registry modifications, and use of whoami.exe—raises suspicions of potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is using these actions to execute code, establish persistence, and clean up traces.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or related network activities, it's hard to be certain. But the pattern here aligns with common indicators of compromise (IoCs) in cybersecurity. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, I'm looking at multiple entries, all related to powershell.exe and other processes.\n\nFirst, I notice that several events mention 'powershell.exe' being executed with command lines like '& {}'. That's a bit generic, but it's worth noting. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any extensive use could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are various events: Provider Lifecycle, Registry value set, Process Create, Image loaded, File created, etc. These seem like normal operations for a script or application running in PowerShell. For example, image loading is typical when executing scripts that require certain libraries.\n\nOne event stands out where a file was created in the user's temp directory with a random name: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1\". Temporary files can be part of script execution, but sometimes they're used to drop malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms. I need to consider if this file is legitimate or potentially harmful.\n\nAnother event is the creation of \".winlogbeat.yml.new\" by winlogbeat.exe. That seems unrelated and probably benign since it's about log collection configuration.\n\nThere are also entries for cmd.exe and whoami.exe, which aren't unusual but could be part of a script's execution flow. The use of conhost.exe might indicate some command line activity, but again, not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts, creating files, loading images, accessing registry keys, and other standard operations. While there are red flags like temporary files and command-line arguments that could be obfuscating commands, without more context or evidence of known malicious behavior (like network communication, persistence mechanisms, or file deletions), it's hard to classify this as definitely malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities described fit a pattern of normal script execution. However, I have some uncertainty because the use of temporary files and multiple PowerShell instances could be signs of something more nefarious. So my confidence isn't super high but leans toward not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal PowerShell activity, including script execution and file creation, without clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of 20 JSONL events to analyze. My goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe is being executed with a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub repo into the temp directory. That's a red flag because downloading files from external sources, especially through PowerShell, can be a sign of malicious activity like script execution or payload download.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where various processes are creating or accessing files and registry entries. For example, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file seems normal if it's part of log management, but I should check for anomalies. Similarly, RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry might be part of legitimate operations, but repeated such actions could indicate suspicious behavior.\n\nI notice several instances where svchost.exe and cmd.exe are involved in process creation or accessing files. Svchost is a common system process, but it's often used by malware to hide activities. The command line for cmd.exe shows it deleting a scheduled task using SCHTASKS, which might be part of cleaning up traces after malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses processes and creates events without clear legitimate purposes. This repeated access could indicate attempts to elevate privileges or establish persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe isn't inherently suspicious but when combined with other activities like process creation and deletions, it might be part of privilege escalation or user information gathering.\n\nI also see several entries where powershell.exe is involved in Provider Lifecycle tasks. While some PowerShell activity is normal, the combination of downloading files, creating new processes, and accessing registry keys suggests a potential attack chain.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of activities that could indicate malicious behavior: downloading an external script, process creation for potentially malicious scripts, deletion of scheduled tasks to avoid detection, and repeated registry modifications which are often used by malware to maintain persistence. These events don't seem to be isolated or part of normal system operations but rather a coordinated sequence that raises concern.\n\nI'm confident enough based on the patterns observed to classify this batch as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially malicious activities including PowerShell downloading an external file, deletion of scheduled tasks, and repeated registry modifications which could indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of log events to analyze, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: It shows that `chrome.exe` detected a network connection. That's normal because Chrome does make connections.\n2. **Event 2**: Another network connection from Chrome again. Still nothing unusual.\n3. **Event 3**: Now, this catches my eye. `powershell.exe` is running with a command line that includes downloading a file from a GitHub repo to the temp directory. PowerShell is often used for scripting but can be a red flag if it's downloading files automatically.\n4. **Events 4-5**: These are about image loading in PowerShell. They're loading some .NET andmscorlib DLLs, which is standard for PowerShell scripts, so not suspicious yet.\n5. **Event 6**: A file is created in the temp directory with a somewhat generic name. This might be part of the script execution process.\n6. **Event 7**: The same file is deleted immediately after being created. That's odd because why create and delete a file unless it's trying to hide something or test permissions.\n7. **Events 8-13**: These events repeat similar patterns: `powershell.exe` downloading files from various GitHub repositories, all under the \"Provider Lifecycle\" task except one under \"Engine Lifecycle\". Each download is to different temp files. This repeated behavior suggests a script that's fetching multiple files, possibly malicious scripts or tools.\n8. **Event 14**: Another pipe created in PowerShell, which could be for communication between processes or command execution.\n9. **Events 15-18**: Chrome setting registry values four times. While unusual if it's modifying system settings, sometimes legitimate applications do this for configuration purposes.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell to download files from different GitHub repositories is a red flag. Each file is being downloaded and saved to the temp directory with names like `modulo_padrao.txt`, `entrada_comum.txt`, etc., which don't immediately indicate malicious activity but could be components of a script or tool.\n\nThe fact that each download is followed by file creation and deletion (except the last one) might mean the files are being executed temporarily or cleaned up to avoid detection. The multiple downloads from different repositories suggest it's part of a larger script, possibly fetching multiple modules or malicious payloads.\n\nAlso, the use of `New-Object System.Net.WebClient` is a common technique in PowerShell scripts for downloading files without using cmd.exe, which is often used by attackers to bypass some monitoring tools.\n\nWhile some events are normal (Chrome connections and registry changes), the pattern of repeated file downloads from external sources, especially via PowerShell, raises concerns about potential malicious activities. It's possible that this script is part of a larger attack vector, such as downloading malware components or establishing persistence on the system.\n\nTherefore, while there's no definitive proof of malicious intent here, the combination of events—especially multiple PowerShell executions with file downloads and deletions—merits closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from external sources and creating\/deleting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the batch of events provided is interesting or not. Let's look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. It starts with a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. Then several events show attempts to remove items from the TEMP folder using specific PowerShell commands. The files being deleted have names like componente_comum.zip, entrada_base.zip, etc., which seem arbitrary but might be malicious.\n\nThere are also registry value sets by powershell.exe processes, which could indicate persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. Additionally, whoami.exe was executed, which is often used to check user permissions and might be part of a reconnaissance phase.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command lines to delete files in the TEMP directory, possibly trying to remove traces or malicious payloads. This pattern is concerning as it could indicate an attacker cleaning up after themselves.\n\nMoreover, some events show loading of system libraries like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe, which might be normal, but combined with the powershell activity, raises suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these activities together, they suggest potential malicious behavior such as file deletion to hide evidence, registry modifications for persistence, and using legitimate tools (like whoami) for lateral movement or privilege checking. This combination makes the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file deletions in the TEMP directory, registry modifications, and other activities indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I see a process named 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. That makes sense because winlogbeat is likely collecting logs and maybe creating some config files. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext up are several events from powershell.exe. One of them has a command line that deletes a temp file called estrutura_padrao.txt using Remove-Item with Force and ignoring errors. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye on this. The fact that it's deleting a specific file in the TEMP directory could indicate something, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is setting registry values. Registry modifications can be part of normal system operations or part of malware persistence mechanisms. Since there are several such events from powershell, I should consider whether these are legitimate admin tasks or signs of malicious activity. The frequency might raise a red flag, but it's also possible that an admin script is doing this.\n\nLooking further, conhost.exe setting a registry value catches my attention. Conhost is usually used for console applications, and seeing it interact with the registry isn't typical unless it's part of some setup or configuration process. Again, without more info, it's hard to judge.\n\nThere are instances where whoami.exe is run from system32, which is normal because it's a standard system command used to display user information. However, if this is happening multiple times in quick succession, it might be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance, so that's something to consider.\n\nI also notice that powershell.exe is accessing various processes (ProcessAccess events). Powershell has many legitimate use cases, but repeated process access could be indicative of lateral movement in an attack. Malware often uses this technique to spread within a network.\n\nAnother point is the file creation by powershell.exe for 'pacote_ativo.txt'. Creating files can be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms. The filename doesn't seem immediately suspicious, but combined with other activities from powershell, it might contribute to concern.\n\nThe events involving chrome.exe modifying the registry are a bit puzzling. Chrome sometimes writes to the registry for updates or settings, but multiple entries could suggest something else is manipulating chrome's behavior, possibly through malicious scripts or extensions.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe performing various actions like file deletions, registry modifications, and process accesses. The frequency and combination of these actions might be beyond normal user activity. Additionally, the deletion of a temp file could indicate an attempt to remove traces of previous operations, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe multiple times might not be necessary for legitimate purposes unless it's part of some automated script checking permissions. The process creation events by powershell and others are happening several times, which could be normal but also possibly part of an attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple powershell actions, file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated process creations—it seems like this batch might indicate malicious behavior. However, some activities could also be legitimate admin tasks or script executions. Since there are several red flags, I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including file deletions, registry modifications, and process accesses, which could indicate malicious behavior. The frequency and combination of these events raise suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
