{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: It's cmd.exe running a command that creates a service called win32times with a binPath pointing to another cmd command which starts a PowerShell script. The script path is c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1, but the name seems off—NonExistingScript suggests it might not be legitimate.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe being accessed. Not immediately suspicious unless there's something in the command line, but here it's just accessed, so maybe setting something up.\n\nThird event: sc.exe creating another service, this time win32times again with a different script path—c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, NonExistingScript makes me think it's not a real file.\n\nFourth and fifth events: services.exe modifying the registry. Services.exe is part of Windows, so maybe it's just updating service configurations, but paired with the previous events, could be setting up something malicious.\n\nSixth event: sc.exe querying the service (qc). Again, this seems related to service creation.\n\nSeventh and eighth events: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's unusual because Calculator usually doesn't need that DLL, which is related to URL handling. Maybe a sign of malicious activity trying to hide or inject code.\n\nNinth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. It's probably part of the log shipping tool, so not suspicious on its own.\n\nTenth event: powershell.exe setting registry values again. Still no command line info, but it could be enabling persistence or modifying system settings for malicious purposes.\n\nEleventh to fourteenth events: chrome.exe activities—creating pipes, accessing the registry, and loading amsi.dll. While Chrome can do these things, the multiple registry writes might indicate something suspicious, maybe trying to inject scripts or modify browser behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a lot of activity involving service creation with potentially non-existent scripts, unusual DLL loads by calc.exe, and repeated powershell and sc.exe activities which are often used in attacks. The combination suggests possible malicious behavior attempting to create persistent backdoors or execute arbitrary scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including service creation attempts with non-existent scripts, unusual file operations by calc.exe, and repeated powershell.exe and sc.exe usage which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
