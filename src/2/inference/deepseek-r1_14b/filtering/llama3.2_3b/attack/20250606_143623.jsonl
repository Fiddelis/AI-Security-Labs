The commands are varied but seem to involve checking for certain files and executing scripts. For example, one event shows a PowerShell command that reads an INF file and looks for specific patterns. This could be part of legitimate system administration or might indicate malicious activity like trying to bypass software protection.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe command that runs Dism with parameters to disable the Windows Defender feature. Disabling antivirus can be a red flag, as attackers often try to remove defenses. The use of Dism in this context is unusual and could indicate an attempt to modify system components or remove security features.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple FileCreate events from both PowerShell and Dism.exe, creating files in various temporary directories. These activities could be part of legitimate script execution, but the combination with disabling Defender raises suspicion.\n\nOverall, while individual actions might not seem malicious, the sequence—using PowerShell to check for certain patterns, attempting to disable security software, and creating multiple temporary files—raises concern about potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activity including attempts to disable Windows Defender using Dism.exe and multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious commands.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few entries are from setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft Edge directory. That seems normal because when software updates or installs components, it creates new files. Setup.exe is a common installer, so that's expected.\n\nNext, there are several events involving svchost.exe interacting with the registry. Svchost.exe is part of Windows services and often legitimate, but malicious actors sometimes use it. However, these events are just Registry value sets or object changes, which could be normal service operations. Without more context, I'm not sure if this is suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a RuntimeBroker.exe making registry changes. Runtime Broker handles things like UWP app sandboxing, so that's standard and shouldn't raise flags.\n\nThen, multiple svchost.exe creating files in the Windows Temp directory with APPX names. These look like temporary files during installation or updates. Again, normal behavior when apps are being installed or updated via the store.\n\nLastly, a File created event for EdgeGameAssist.exe by svchost.exe and another in AppReadiness. Edge Game Assist is a legitimate app, so this seems okay.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events involve standard system processes creating files, updating registry entries, and handling temporary files. There's nothing that stands out as malicious or unusual enough to warrant an investigation.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs, each line being an event. My task is to analyze all of them together and decide whether they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's about powershell.exe creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\tarefa_logico.exe. Then it starts that service. That seems suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads various .NET framework DLLs. That's normal in some cases since PowerShell does use these libraries, but combined with the previous event, it might indicate that something is being executed that shouldn't be.\n\nThen, I see a file creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1). This looks like an attempt to create and then delete a script file. Malware often does this to erase evidence of its activities. Also, the fact that it's in the Temporary folder might mean it's trying not to be too obvious.\n\nAfter that, there are several events where services.exe and svchost.exe are modifying registry values. Services.exe is legitimate, but if it's making changes without reason, especially multiple times, it could indicate tampering with system configurations. Svchost.exe is known for hosting services, but when it's involved in registry writes, it might be part of a malicious process.\n\nThere are also events where setup.exe is creating files related to Microsoft EdgeCore. That seems more benign unless the paths look unusual or if there's an attempt to overwrite legitimate files, which isn't evident here.\n\nPutting this all together: The creation of a new service via PowerShell, the temporary script file with a suspicious name, multiple registry modifications by services.exe and svchost.exe—all these points add up. They could be signs of malware attempting persistence, creating backdoors, or altering system configurations to hide its presence.\n\nI'm not seeing clear indicators that would definitely classify this as malicious, but there are enough red flags to raise concern. So I'd say it's interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activity including creation of a new service using powershell.exe with an unusual name and binary path, followed by file operations that may indicate an attempt to hide malicious scripts.

They all seem to involve processes from Dism.exe and DismHost.exe, which I remember are related to Windows Deployment Services.

The files have names like WimProvider.dll.mui and others ending with .dll, which are common for DLLs used by applications.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events from a user's system. Each event is a JSON object, and there are 14 lines here. The first thing I notice is that each line has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process key consistently shows \"Dism.exe\". Dism stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management, which I remember is a tool used in Windows for servicing operating system images. So it's related to disk management and image handling, often used during OS installation or updates.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every single entry has the same task: \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\". That suggests that each event is a detection of an executable file being accessed or opened. It's a standard Windows log for when executables are detected on the system, which could be part of normal operations or potentially malicious activities.\n\nThe file paths all point to various .exe and .dll files located in temporary directories under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\". The directory names include GUID-like strings (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89), which is common for temporary files to avoid name conflicts. The specific files being detected are things like DismHost.exe, several .dll files with names like DismProv.dll, and various .mui files in the en-US subdirectory.\n\nNow, thinking about what's normal: Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing OS images. When it runs, it might extract or access these files as part of its operation. The temporary directory suggests that this could be during an update, installation, or some system maintenance task where files are temporarily stored and executed.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if these events occurred within a short period, it's likely part of a single process, such as installing updates or running a script that uses Dism. The multiple file accesses could be related to extracting necessary components or updating the system image.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is out of the ordinary. Since all events are generated by Dism.exe accessing various files in a temp directory, and given that Dism is a legitimate process, it doesn't immediately raise red flags. However, the volume of these events—14 in total—is something to note. If this were happening over an extended period or across multiple sessions without reason, it might warrant closer investigation.\n\nAnother angle: The fact that each event is labeled as \"File Executable Detected\" could indicate monitoring by security software. Since Dism.exe is a known process, these detections are probably part of normal system activity rather than malicious behavior.\n\nI should also check if the presence of .mui files is relevant. These are usually resource files for localization, so their inclusion here doesn't seem suspicious in this context.\n\nConsidering all these points, while it's always good to be cautious with log analysis, there's no clear indication that these events are part of malicious activity. They appear to be legitimate operations performed by Dism.exe during its normal course of servicing the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Dism.exe accessing files in a temporary directory, which is typical for legitimate OS servicing tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format, so there's one JSON object per line. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. The first few events mention \"DismHost.exe\" loading various DLL files into memory. The paths of these DLLs are all under a temporary directory created by DismHost.exe. These seem like standard operations where the process is loading necessary components for its operation.\n\nThen, I notice that after loading several DLLs, there are events from \"Dism.exe\". These events log file deletions. Specifically, they're deleting files and their MUI (Multilingual User Interface) components. The paths being deleted are similar to the ones loaded earlier, which makes sense as part of a cleanup process.\n\nNow, thinking about DismHost.exe and Dism.exe, I recall that these are legitimate processes related to Windows Deployment Services. DismHost is used for servicing operating systems, while Dism.exe is typically associated with deployment image service provider operations. The actions of loading DLLs and then deleting them afterward fit within the expected behavior of these tools during an imaging or servicing task.\n\nLooking at each event individually might not raise any red flags because each action seems normal. However, considering the entire batch together, it's clear that this is part of a standard deployment process. There are multiple file loads followed by deletions, which could indicate temporary files being used and then cleaned up after a specific operation completes.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. All the processes are named correctly, the file paths are within expected locations for temporary data, and the actions (loading and deleting files) are typical during such operations. There's no evidence of unexpected processes, unusual file names, or access patterns that would suggest an attack.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't indicate anything suspicious. They appear to be part of a legitimate system operation related to Windows deployment services.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows DismHost.exe loading DLLs and subsequent deletions by Dism.exe, which are normal during Windows servicing or deployment operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I see that there are 14 JSON objects, each representing an event. The common thread here is the process name \"Dism.exe\" and the task being a file delete logged under the rule FileDeleteDetected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Dism.exe does. From my knowledge, Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. It's used in Windows deployment for servicing operating system images. So, it's part of legitimate Windows operations.\n\nLooking at each event, they all log a file deletion by Dism.exe. The files being deleted are located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder. The filenames vary but end with .dll.mui or .dll. These seem to be localized resource files for various providers like IBSProvider, IntlProvider, etc., and some generic ones like GenericProvider.\n\nNow, why would Dism.exe delete these files? Well, during the servicing of an OS image, it's common for Dism.exe to clean up temporary or unnecessary files. Temporary files in the Temp directory are often deleted as part of standard operations to free up space or ensure a clean environment.\n\nConsidering the context, this batch shows multiple deletions from the same process and same location. It seems consistent with normal system maintenance rather than malicious activity. There's no indication here of any unusual behavior, such as deleting files outside the expected locations, accessing restricted areas, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate a breach.\n\nI should also think about whether such events are typical. In a healthy Windows environment, especially during updates or image servicing, Dism.exe runs and deletes temporary files regularly. This would be part of standard logs and wouldn't raise any red flags among sysadmins familiar with these processes.\n\nTherefore, the classification shouldn't be \"INTERESTING\" because there's no sign of suspicious behavior. Instead, it's a routine operation by a legitimate system tool. The confidence level is high here since all events fit within expected patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the Dism.exe process deleting multiple .dll files from a temporary directory, which is consistent with normal system operations during image servicing and cleanup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. The first event involves a PowerShell command execution with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That catches my attention because even though it's restricted, sometimes adversaries might use such commands for certain tasks. The command checks for specific INF files in Windows directory and looks for patterns related to defaultinstall sections. This could be part of an installation routine or something more malicious.\n\nThe next two events are about logon and group management without any process or file information. They seem generic and not unusual on their own. But when combined with the first event, I start thinking about potential indicators of compromise, like privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm considering if these events together could indicate an attack. The PowerShell script might be checking for something that indicates a vulnerability or trying to deploy malicious INF files. If no such files are found, it's probably benign, but the presence of this check alone makes me think there's potential malicious intent.\n\nHowever, since I only have three events and two of them are non-specific, my confidence isn't super high. But the first event is significant enough on its own to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a PowerShell command that checks for specific INF files which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event. The task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see that the command line in each process starts with \"powershell.exe\" and has \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\". That's interesting because PowerShell commands can be malicious, especially when using restricted execution policies. The initial commands are \"Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\", which seems harmless on the surface—just outputting a message.\n\nBut then I notice that some events have different command lines. Specifically, from event 6 onwards, the command becomes more complex. It's checking for certain patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. The script is iterating over all .inf files and looking for specific sections like \"[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]\". This seems suspicious because accessing system files and looking for particular configurations could be an attempt to gather information or modify system settings.\n\nThe \"winlog\" field shows tasks related to \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". Provider lifecycle events are typically about service providers starting, stopping, or unregistering, which might not be directly malicious but can indicate script activity. Engine lifecycle refers more to the runtime aspects of scripts, so again, this aligns with PowerShell execution.\n\nAnother point is that these events occur multiple times—repeating similar commands and tasks. Repetition could suggest automated behavior or a script running in a loop, which might be part of legitimate testing but could also be indicative of malicious activity trying different approaches.\n\nPutting it all together: there are repeated attempts to execute PowerShell scripts with restricted execution policies, some of which are accessing system configuration files. This combination raises flags because it involves unusual file accesses and multiple, repetitive actions that could be part of an attempt to gather information or modify the system in a way that's not typical user behavior.\n\nHowever, I'm trying to balance this against whether it's clearly malicious or just suspicious but possibly benign. The fact that they're using \"Write-Host\" suggests outputting messages, which isn't harmful on its own, but when combined with file access, it could be part of a reconnaissance script checking for certain system configurations.\n\nSo, the batch is interesting because while some events look innocent, others show signs of potentially malicious scripting. The confidence level isn't too high since I can't conclusively determine malice without more context, but there are enough red flags to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with restricted policies and file system access patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at a bunch of logs that seem to be related to some processes running on a system, probably Windows since the logs mention \"winlog\". The logs are in JSON format, and each entry has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, the entries vary. Some have detailed command lines for processes, others just say \"None\" or have different tasks under winlog. Let me go through them one by one to see if I can spot a pattern or anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first log entry:\n- The process has a long command line that looks like it's from a Windows event viewer export. It includes things like Provider, EventID, Level, etc. There are parameters for an executable path and some arguments. This seems to be a system-generated log rather than user activity.\n  \nSecond entry is empty for all three keys except maybe the braces.\n\nThen comes entries where the process key has a command line involving powershell.exe creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path, then starting that service. The winlog task here is related to provider lifecycle, which makes sense because it's about services being created or started.\n\nThere are multiple entries like this, each showing the same PowerShell command being run. Then towards the end, there are entries where the process command line changes slightly: it uses powershell.exe with ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted and runs a Write-Host command to output \"Final result: 1\". The winlog task here is again provider lifecycle.\n\nI'm trying to think if these commands could be part of some script execution or automated process. Creating a service with PowerShell suggests that something is being installed as a background service, maybe for persistence or scheduled tasks.\n\nThe fact that the same command repeats multiple times makes me wonder if it's part of a loop or retry logic in a script. The initial part creates and starts the service, and then later commands are just outputting a result. \n\nI should consider possible malicious activities here. Creating services can be a way for malware to persist across reboots. If \"objeto_ativo\" is a custom service, it's something to check against known good services on the system. Also, the use of Write-Host might indicate that the script is checking if everything was successful.\n\nBut maybe there's nothing wrong here; perhaps it's just legitimate software installation or scripts running. To be sure, I'd need to look into what \"objeto_ativo\" does and whether those file paths are correct and safe.\n\nI should also note the repeated use of the same command line as a possible indicator of something being executed multiple times, maybe in different contexts or by different users. The restricted execution policy might mean that the script is running with limited privileges, which could be normal but worth monitoring.\n\nIn summary, these logs show system processes involving PowerShell creating and managing services. They could be benign administrative actions, but without more context on what \"objeto_ativo\" is, it's hard to say definitively if there's any malicious intent here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate the execution of PowerShell commands that create and start a new service named \"objeto_ativo\". These activities are associated with system processes related to provider lifecycle events. While these actions could be part of legitimate system administration or software installation, they may also suggest potential malicious activity, such as creating persistent services for unauthorized access.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Commands:** Multiple entries show the creation and starting of a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. This could be setting up a background service for persistence.\n\n2. **Check Service Details:** The binary path in the command points to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. Verifying if this file is legitimate and known to the system is crucial.\n\n3. **Analyze PowerShell Commands:** Use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` indicates scripts are running with limited privileges, which might be a security measure but could also mask malicious activities.\n\n4. **Look for Repeated Actions:** The repeated creation and starting of the same service may indicate automated or script-based actions, possibly indicating an attempt to ensure the service remains active.\n\n5. **Monitor Output Commands:** The final commands outputting \"Final result: 1\" might be part of a verification process, ensuring that the service was successfully created and started.\n\n6. **Investigate Service Impact:** Determine if \"objeto_ativo\" is a known or authorized service on the system. Unfamiliar services should be closely examined for signs of unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Review File Paths:** Ensure all file paths referenced in the commands are legitimate and part of expected processes. Malicious actors often use misleading or obfuscated paths to hide their activities.\n\n8. **Consider Event Timing:** If these logs occur around suspicious times (e.g., outside normal business hours), it could raise concerns about unauthorized access.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe logs suggest that a service named \"objeto_ativo\" is being created and started via PowerShell, potentially indicating either legitimate administrative activity or malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence. Further investigation into the nature of this service and its files is recommended to determine if there's any security risk involved."}
