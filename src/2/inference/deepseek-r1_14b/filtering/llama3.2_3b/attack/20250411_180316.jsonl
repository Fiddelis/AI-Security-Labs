Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few instances where whoami.exe and cmd.exe are being run. Whoami is typically used to find out user information, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of reconnaissance. Cmd.exe with the \/c command suggests that it's executing another command, possibly leading to something else.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe appearing multiple times. PowerShell can do a lot, both good and bad. The fact that it's being accessed and modified registry values is concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools like regedit or PowerShell for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking further, there are file operations involving .dll files loaded by chrome.exe. That could be normal, but sometimes malicious scripts can inject into legitimate processes. There's also a FileDeleteDetected event where a PowerShell script was deleted from the Temp folder. That's a red flag because attackers might delete their own traces to avoid detection.\n\nThere are multiple events with command lines like powershell.exe & {}, which doesn't look standard. This could be an attempt to execute arbitrary code or hide commands, making it suspicious. The Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks under winlog for PowerShell also seem related to how the script is being executed and managed.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files in startup folders with specific naming like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Attackers might use this to maintain persistence across reboots or sessions.\n\nConsidering all these together, it seems like there's a lot of activity around PowerShell, file deletions, and potential attempts at persistence and privilege escalation. These activities don't align with normal user behavior and could indicate malicious intent. So, the batch as a whole is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process creations (whoami.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe), registry modifications, file deletions, and potential script execution detected, indicating possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. They're all from the same process—Powershell running multiple times with command lines that create and modify batch files. The commands are creating new items and setting content in specific paths, which is a bit concerning because it could be a precursor to malicious activities like file creation for payloads or scripts.\n\nI notice that each event involves Powershell executing commands that touch various parts of the filesystem. The repeated use of \"New-Item\" and \"Set-Content\" suggests automation or script execution. Also, the paths used seem inconsistent and vary across different directories, which might be an attempt to avoid detection by spreading out files.\n\nLooking at the tasks from the Windows logs—Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, Provider Lifecycle—it seems like the system is tracking process creation and dynamic-link library (DLL) loading. The fact that some events mention \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"ProcessAccess\" adds more context about how Powershell is being utilized.\n\nConsidering the file paths mentioned, like \"modulo_secundario\", \"pacote_base\", and others, these don't seem to be standard Windows directories. This could indicate that the script is placing files in custom locations, possibly to hide or execute them later. The use of relative paths with \"..\" might be an attempt to navigate to parent directories, which can sometimes be a sign of malicious behavior trying to reach system directories.\n\nThe combination of multiple Powershell instances each performing similar file operations raises my suspicion. It could be part of a larger script that's deploying files across the system. While some legitimate scripts do this, the volume and varied paths here are red flags.\n\nI also note that some command lines have exit conditions based on whether certain files exist or not. This conditional execution is common in malware to ensure it runs only under specific conditions or if certain checks pass.\n\nOverall, while there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like file deletion or unauthorized access, the pattern of repeated Powershell script executions creating and modifying multiple files across different directories suggests potential malicious intent. The use of Powershell, which is often targeted by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities, combined with these actions, makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that create and modify files in various directories, potentially indicating malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm going through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event shows RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Runtime Broker is part of Windows and often does such tasks.\n\nNext, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Hmm, that's odd because calc usually doesn't need to load external DLLs. Maybe it's malicious or a test?\n\nThen, powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things. But seeing multiple process accesses might indicate suspicious activity.\n\nsvchost.exe setting registry values twice. Svchost is another common Windows process, but setting registry values could be part of legitimate operations or potentially malicious.\n\nThe Calculator.exe also loads urlmon.dll, which mirrors the calc.exe event. This repetition makes me think it's not a coincidence—could be an attempt to hide malicious activity by using common processes.\n\nThere's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is likely part of logging setup, so that's probably benign.\n\nMultiple powershell.exe accessing processes stand out. It might be someone trying to gather information or execute commands, which could be suspicious.\n\nThe cmd.exe with a command line deleting notepad.exe. Deleting processes isn't inherently bad, but the way it's done here using wmic might be a red flag, especially if there's no clear reason for doing so.\n\nWMIC process creation is interesting because WMIC can be used to execute commands remotely. This could be part of an attack chain, like command-and-control or lateral movement.\n\nChrome.exe setting registry values a few times—maybe related to plugins or settings changes, but it's worth noting if it happens excessively.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's concerning because replacing system files can allow persistence or privilege escalation. SHTC is often used in ransomware or other attacks.\n\nPowerShell accessing again and another process creation with schtasks. Schtasks is for scheduling tasks, but deleting a task might be part of removing traces of an attack or preventing detection.\n\nFinally, schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll—this seems normal as it's the supporting DLL for task scheduler functions.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell and cmd instances doing process accesses and creations, deletion of processes and files, registry modifications. These activities could indicate someone trying to establish persistence, execute malicious commands, or cover their tracks. The repetition and use of tools like WMIC and schtasks are red flags often seen in attacks. So overall, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes, deletion of system files, and use of command-line tools like cmd.exe and WMIC suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm just starting out with cybersecurity and log analysis, so bear with me as I work through this.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: powershell.exe accessed something via ProcessAccess.\n2. **Event 2**: whoami.exe was created. That seems normal because it's a common system tool used to get user information.\n3. **Events 3-8**: Multiple PowerShell processes are being executed with command lines that check if certain .bat files exist. The commands look like they're testing the existence of specific files and exiting based on that. This is a bit odd because I'm not sure why PowerShell would be checking for these particular files repeatedly.\n4. **Event 9**: powershell.exe loaded an image (mscoreei.dll). That's normal since PowerShell often loads various DLLs.\n5. **Events 10-13**: More file operations—creating and deleting temporary files, loading images, and registry changes from chrome.exe. These seem more routine but worth noting if there's a pattern.\n6. **Event 14**: Another ProcessAccess for powershell.exe.\n7. **Event 15**: A file was created by PowerShell in the user's Downloads folder—elemento_padrao.txt. That could be suspicious if it's unexpected, but without context, hard to say.\n8. **Event 16-17**: File deletion and pipe creation events for PowerShell.\n\nPutting this together, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that check for specific files. This behavior could indicate a few things:\n\n- **Legitimate Use**: Maybe the system is running scripts or checks as part of normal operations.\n- **Potential Malware**: Alternatively, the repeated checking and file deletions might be signs of malicious activity. Powershell is commonly used by attackers for its legitimate use and scripting capabilities.\n\nThe multiple calls to create and delete temporary files in different locations (like AppData and Downloads) could be a way for malware to clean up traces or spread components. Also, the .bat files being checked might contain malicious scripts that are executed if they exist.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe. While it's common for legitimate use, the combination with these checks and file operations raises suspicion. Additionally, there's a registry change from chrome.exe, which could be part of normal operation but should be checked to ensure no malicious changes were made.\n\nI'm not sure if all these events happening together are just coincidental or part of an attack. The fact that several events relate to the same process (powershell.exe) and involve file system operations that could be used for persistence or lateral movement makes this batch interesting enough to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including repeated file existence checks, creation of temporary files, and deletions.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given batch of system events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are PowerShell processes being executed with command lines that check if certain files exist. The 'Test-Path' cmdlet is used in these command lines to verify the presence of specific .bat or .exe files. This pattern repeats multiple times with different file paths. It seems like these are checks to see if certain scripts or executables are present on the system.\n\nSome events mention tasks related to Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, and others, which are normal operations for PowerShell as it starts up or manages its components. There's also an event where a file is created in the Temp directory with a name that includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which I recognize is part of PowerShell's script policy testing mechanism. This is typically done to ensure scripts are allowed to run and doesn't indicate malicious activity on its own.\n\nHowever, there's another event where this temporary file is deleted immediately after creation. While this could be part of a legitimate process cleanup, it might also raise suspicion because deleting files quickly can sometimes be an attempt to cover tracks. But considering the other events, it might just be normal script testing behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of actual malicious activities like unauthorized access, unusual file accesses, or communication with external servers. The events are all related to PowerShell's operation and script checks, which could be part of system administration tasks or legitimate script execution.\n\nThe confidence level is medium because while the batch doesn't show clear signs of compromise, the repeated checks for specific files and quick deletion of a temporary file could warrant closer monitoring to ensure there's no underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes check for specific files; one creates and quickly deletes a temp script file.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}

I'll go through each event step by step and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific files using Test-Path. For example, one command line checks if \"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\registro_temporario\\\\registro_secundario\\\\bin\\\\componente_secundario.exe\" exists and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. This kind of behavior is common in scripts to verify file presence but could be malicious if the files are part of a payload.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run, which might indicate an attempt to gather system information. Similarly, cmd.exe is used with a command that checks for \"objeto_logico.txt\" in the temp directory and exits based on its existence. These commands could be part of reconnaissance or as part of a larger script execution.\n\nNotably, several events involve powershell.exe accessing different registry values and loading various image files like mscoree.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll, which are legitimate but could also be indicators if they're being accessed in an unusual context. Additionally, there's an event where powershell.exe loads a DLL from Windows Defender's Platform directory, which might raise suspicion as attackers sometimes use such paths to hide their activities.\n\nThe repeated pattern of powershell.exe executions with conditional exits on file existence suggests possible installation or execution of malicious scripts that depend on certain files being present. This could be part of a payload delivery mechanism where the script only proceeds if specific conditions are met, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nMoreover, the use of cmd.exe in combination with powershell.exe might indicate script-based attacks, as attackers often chain commands using these tools to execute payloads or achieve persistence. The fact that multiple such events occur across different tasks (Engine Lifecycle, Process Create, Registry value set) adds to the concern, suggesting a coordinated sequence of actions that could be malicious.\n\nWhile some of these activities could be legitimate system administration tasks, the combination and frequency of these events—especially the repeated file existence checks in various directories and the use of command-line tools for potential information gathering—make this batch stand out. The varied locations checked (like C:\\\\registro_principal, C:\\\\objeto_auxiliar) might not align with standard operations, hinting at a possible attempt to locate or execute files across different paths.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might seem benign, the overall pattern suggests a potential malicious activity, such as payload deployment or system reconnaissance. The high number of powershell.exe executions with specific file checks and command chaining increases the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that check for file existence across various directories, combined with other process creations (e.g., whoami.exe, cmd.exe) and registry activities, suggest potential malicious behavior or script execution.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe, which is often used in scripting and can be a red flag because it's commonly exploited by attackers. The first two events show that PowerShell created and deleted a temporary file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting files quickly, especially in temp directories, can be indicative of malicious activity trying to leave minimal traces.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell checks if a specific script exists (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and exits based on its presence. This is suspicious because such scripts could be attempting to bypass detection or perform unauthorized actions like keylogging. The fact that the command lines are testing for the existence of these files adds to the concern.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of whoami.exe, which is typically used to get user information. While not inherently malicious, its frequent execution in this context might suggest an attacker checking permissions or credentials, especially when combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nThere's also a process where notepad.exe accesses the registry and calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. These could be normal operations, but they don't stand out as particularly concerning on their own. However, the combination of multiple unusual events makes me more cautious.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries are interesting because it's a legitimate system process, but sometimes malware can replace or manipulate genuine svchost processes. The network connection detected in one of these might be an attempt to communicate with external servers, which could indicate command and control activities.\n\nChrome's network connections and DNS queries seem normal unless they're pointing to known malicious domains, which isn't evident here. But again, combined with other events, it adds a layer that needs consideration.\n\nFinally, the last event shows PowerShell accessing the registry. This can be part of legitimate operations but could also be used to modify system configurations or hide malware components.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell creating and deleting files, checking for script existence, whoami.exe executions, svchost network activity, and a final process creating with a suspicious command line. These collectively suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe creating and deleting files in the temp directory, checking for script existence, and other suspicious activities indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's appearing several times might already raise some flags, but we need to look deeper into what each event shows.\n\nLooking at the first few events: one creates a file named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1', then another deletes it. This could be part of script testing or verification processes, which isn't necessarily malicious on its own. However, the repeated use of PowerShell is something to watch.\n\nNext, there are several events where 'powershell.exe' is launched with command lines that check for the existence of specific .ps1 files using Test-Path. The paths referenced seem arbitrary and vary across different directories, which might indicate some form of script execution attempt or testing if certain scripts exist before proceeding.\n\nThe fact that these commands are exiting based on whether a file exists (exit 0 if present, else exit 1) suggests that the script is checking for something before executing. This behavior could be part of legitimate scripting, but it's also a common tactic in malware to ensure files are present before dropping payloads or to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where 'whoami.exe' is executed. While this can be used for legitimate purposes like checking user permissions, in the context of multiple PowerShell executions and file operations, it could indicate an attempt to gather system information for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThe files referenced in the command lines (like Get-Keystrokes.ps1) sound suspicious because their names imply keylogging or data extraction activities. The repeated attempts to access these files across different paths might be an indicator of a script trying multiple locations to find and execute malicious code.\n\nMoreover, the events show various tasks like 'File created', 'Process Create', and 'Image loaded'. These are common in both benign and malicious activities. However, combined with the use of PowerShell and the specific file names mentioned, it increases the suspicion level.\n\nI also notice that some events don't have associated files, which could mean they're part of a larger chain of events where only certain steps trigger file interactions. This might be an attempt to fly under the radar by not generating too much file activity at once.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs that could indicate malicious behavior: repeated PowerShell use with specific command structures, checks for potentially harmful scripts, execution of whoami.exe, and references to files with suspicious names. While each event alone might not be alarming, the combination suggests a possible attack vector or at least unusual activity worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions checking for specific script files, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events involve powershell.exe. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The first four events show Powershell loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are related to the .NET framework, which isn't unusual on its own, but combined with other actions, it might be worth looking into.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe is executing a command line script: \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}\". This looks suspicious because the command-line arguments are using multiple aliases for 'Get-ChildItem' (like ls and gci), which could indicate an attempt to list files in directories. Using multiple aliases might be a tactic to avoid detection or make the command harder to analyze quickly.\n\nLooking further, I see that several of these events have \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks associated with them. These are related to the PowerShell engine starting up or initializing modules, which could be normal if it's part of the script execution process. However, paired with the file enumeration command, it might suggest that the script is performing some reconnaissance on the system.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created by Powershell in the user's AppData directory: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\". This could be storing configuration data or logs from the script. Since it's in a non-standard location and named with 'StartupProfileData', it might not be something typical, so that's another point to consider.\n\nAnother event involves Registry value being set by Powershell.exe. Changing registry values can have various legitimate purposes, but without knowing exactly what was changed, this could be a sign of malicious activity aiming to persist across reboots or alter system configurations.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml configuration file in the Downloads directory. While this is more likely benign since it's part of log management software, it doesn't add much to the suspicious activities but does indicate that monitoring tools are running.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated Powershell activity with potentially malicious script execution, loading various DLLs, creating files in non-standard locations, and modifying registry values. These behaviors could be indicative of a broader attack or unauthorized access attempt.\n\nI also note that the same command line appears multiple times across different events, suggesting it's part of a loop or repeated process. This might not necessarily be malicious but does warrant closer examination to ensure there isn't an ongoing exploit or data exfiltration happening.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some activities could be legitimate (like Powershell scripts for system admin tasks), the combination of multiple unusual behaviors and potential indicators of compromise points towards something that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious commands, loading DLLs, creating files in non-standard locations, and modifying registry values suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
