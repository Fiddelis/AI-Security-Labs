I'll go through each event one by one and look for patterns or red flags that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'calc.exe' loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal since calc is a common process, but I'm noting the file path as it's system32. Next, Calculator.exe doing the same thingâ€”nothing unusual there either.\n\nLooking at the third entry, svchost.exe accessing something via registry. Svchost is part of legitimate services, so unless it's doing something unexpected, this might not be a red flag yet. The fourth event has whoami.exe being executed without any file access, which could be normal or potentially for privilege escalation if used inappropriately.\n\nThe fifth and tenth events involve ApplicationFrameHost.exe and chrome.exe respectively, both accessing registry values. Chrome is a common process, so this might not raise concerns immediately. However, repeated registry accesses could be worth monitoring.\n\nThe sixth event has powershell.exe being accessed, which is often flagged because it's a powerful tool that can execute commands. Then, in the seventh event, cmd.exe is used with a command to delete 'notepad.exe' via wmic. This deletion of processes is interesting because notepad is usually benign, but automated deletions could be part of a script.\n\nThe eighth and ninth events involve WMIC.exe executing process deletions as well. WMIC is another tool often used for remote commands and can be malicious if misused. The fact that it's deleting processes could indicate an attempt to remove traces or prevent logging.\n\nLooking at the twelfth event, cmd.exe again with a command to copy 'sethc_backup.exe' over 'sethec.exe'. This replacement of system files is a big red flag because sethc.exe is related to system restore. Replacing it might allow an attacker to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\nFurther down, there's another powershell.exe event accessing something via registry and cmd.exe deleting a scheduled task named 'win32times'. Deleting tasks can be part of cleaning up after malicious activity, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nMultiple instances of whoami.exe and powershell.exe being executed without clear justification also stand out. These tools are often used in attacks for information gathering or execution of commands, so their repeated use could indicate an attacker probing the system.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of events that include process creations, deletions, file replacements, and registry modifications using tools known for malicious activities. The combination suggests possible unauthorized access attempts, potentially indicating a breach. While some events on their own might not be concerning, the cluster of suspicious actions over multiple entries makes this batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes including powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe executing commands like process deletions, file replacements, and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in malicious scripts and command-line attacks. But sometimes it's also legitimate for system administration tasks. I'll note that there are several ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe.\n\nThen, cmd.exe appears a couple of times with command lines that look like \"\/c\", which usually means they're executing some other commands. This might be part of a script or batch process. Not immediately suspicious, but combined with powershell, it's something to watch.\n\nI also see whoami.exe being run. Whoami is typically used to display user information, so not inherently bad, but in the context of these logs, maybe someone is trying to find out the current user, which could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nThere are some registry value sets and image loads involving DLLs. For example, amsi.dll is related to antivirus scanning, so if that's being loaded, perhaps an attempt to bypass detection? Or it might just be normal operation. Similarly, mscoreei.dll is part of the .NET framework, so again, not sure.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe creates a temporary file (__PSScriptPolicyTest...), which is then deleted shortly after. This pattern can sometimes indicate malicious activity where scripts are written to disk temporarily and then cleaned up quickly to avoid detection. Alternatively, it could be legitimate scripting testing policies, but the combination with other activities might raise concerns.\n\nThere are also events involving cmd.exe and whoami.exe being created multiple times. The repeated use of these tools in a short period could be indicative of automated or malicious scripts trying different commands.\n\nAdditionally, the last few entries mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" for powershell.exe. This might not be too concerning on its own but could relate to how the script is initializing or terminating processes.\n\nOverall, the batch shows multiple signs that could indicate suspicious activity: repeated use of powershell with varying command lines, creation and deletion of temporary files by powershell, execution of whoami.exe, and other tools like cmd.exe. These actions together might suggest a potential attack, such as script testing, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of events indicates possible malicious behavior, even though individually they might not all be suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe accesses and file operations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. I'm looking at each JSON object provided.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first event is running whoami.exe as a process. That's usually a benign command used by users or scripts to check permissions. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple PowerShell processes starting with \"&\" and some if statements checking for file paths. These look like they're testing whether certain files exist. This could be part of legitimate script execution, but it might also indicate something malicious trying to check if a specific file is present before proceeding.\n\nLooking further, I see events where PowerShell is accessing other modules and files, like clrjit.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are standard for .NET applications running in PowerShell, so that's not unusual.\n\nBut wait, there's an event where a file is being deleted: FileDeleteDetected for \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1\". Deleting files can be part of cleaning up after a script runs, but it could also indicate attempts to remove evidence or delete unwanted files.\n\nThere's another event where a file is being created in the StartupProfileData directory. That's a user-specific folder, so again, might not be malicious, but tracking changes there is good practice.\n\nI also notice several Registry value sets and Pipe Created events. These are common in PowerShell scripts to interact with system settings or create communication channels between processes. However, depending on what they're doing, this could be malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.\n\nThe last event stands out: it's a Process Create where the command line includes creating new items and setting content in batch files. Specifically, writing \"dir\" to a file suggests it might be setting up a script that could execute directory listing commands. This could be part of data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several red flags: multiple PowerShell processes with unusual command lines, file deletions and creations in user directories, registry modifications, and attempts to write scripts. These activities could indicate an adversary trying to establish persistence, test for existing files (potentially to check if certain tools are present), or attempting to execute commands that might be part of a larger attack.\n\nWhile some events on their own aren't suspicious, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior, especially considering the repeated use of PowerShell with non-standard command lines and file system interactions. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell processes with unusual command-line arguments, including file creation\/deletion activities and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most of them involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities and how it can be weaponized.\n\nThe first few events are about Registry value sets and image loads. They're setting registry values and loading various DLLs which are part of .NET Framework. This might seem normal, but when combined with other suspicious actions, it could indicate something's off.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe is being called with specific command lines. The commands create new items (files) in different directories and set their content to \"dir\". Creating multiple files in various locations might be an attempt to establish persistence or write malicious scripts. The fact that each event creates a .bat file and writes \"dir\" suggests they're setting up something, possibly for later execution.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where PowerShell accesses the ProcessAccess task, which could be related to privilege escalation or process injection. Also, some events show loading of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which might not be malicious on its own but can sometimes be used in attacks to mimic legitimate processes.\n\nAnother point is the file creation under the user's AppData directory for PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This could be an attempt to store configuration or scripts that run at startup, again indicating potential persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files across different directories with specific naming conventions and content, combined with process access events and known malicious behaviors associated with PowerShell scripting, make this batch suspicious. The repeated pattern of file creation and the use of RegistryEvent tasks could be part of an attack chain, such as dropping malware components or establishing persistence.\n\nI'm confident that these activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior, so I'd classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances creating files in various locations with suspicious naming patterns and content, possibly indicating malicious script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, most of the logs are from PowerShell executions. They check for specific files using `Test-Path` and exit with 0 or 1. This seems like a script checking if certain files exist. It's possible someone is verifying file presence, which could be benign, but might also indicate something malicious like ensuring payload components are in place.\n\nThere's an event where PowerShell deletes a file: `FileDeleteDetected`. That stands out because deleting files can be part of data exfiltration or covering tracks. I need to consider if this deletion is suspicious, especially since it's logged by the system.\n\nAnother event involves creating a `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file. This seems related to the WinlogBeat tool configuration. It might be legitimate, but if this process isn't expected, it could indicate tampering with log collection tools.\n\nA `whoami.exe` execution is logged too. While common for user identification, it's worth noting if this runs without a clear purpose or in an unexpected context.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell checks across various paths, one file deletion, and configuration changes. This combination could be part of reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence. The repeated use of PowerShell with conditional checks on files is concerning because it suggests automated behavior possibly related to malicious activities.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some events could be benign, the volume and nature of these actions together raise suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with conditional checks on file existence, a file deletion event, and creation\/modification of system files suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The command lines in these events check for the existence of specific files using Test-Path. That seems suspicious because attackers often use PowerShell to check if certain files exist as part of a persistence mechanism. If the file exists, they might exit; otherwise, they proceed with something else.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe deletes a file in the Temp directory. Deleting log files or traces is a common tactic to cover tracks. This could indicate malicious activity trying to remove evidence.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe was run twice. While this can be legitimate, it's often used by attackers to check user privileges or lateral movement within a system. The cmd.exe command checking for the existence of a file in the Temp directory might be part of a script to execute commands conditionally, which could be malicious.\n\nLooking at the tasks: Process Create, Image Load, File Delete, Registry access, and Pipe Creation. Some of these are normal, but combined with the suspicious command lines, they raise red flags.\n\nThe repeated Process Access events on powershell.exe might indicate attempts to inject code or manipulate the process. Also, loading various DLLs could be part of a loader or payload execution.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows several indicators of potential malicious activity: multiple PowerShell instances checking for file existence, deletion of files in Temp, use of whoami and cmd.exe with specific commands, and registry access.

Each event shows the process name as 'powershell.exe' and various tasks like Provider Lifecycle, Image Load, and File Creation. The command lines in some events are checking if specific files exist and exiting based on that. This repeated check might be part of a script testing file presence, which could be normal for scripts or tools but might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking at the paths in the Test-Path commands: they vary across different directories like C:\\modulo_secundario, C:\\unidade_base, etc., and some mention files with .cs and .ps1 extensions. PowerShell scripts (.ps1) are common targets for malicious activities because they can execute arbitrary code. The fact that multiple .ps1 files are being checked suggests possible attempts to verify their existence or maybe download them.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation event in the User profile directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This could be related to PowerShell profile scripts running at startup. Malware often uses such profiles to maintain persistence across reboots.\n\nAlso, several Image Load events for DLLs like MpClient.dll and clr.dll are logged. These might be legitimate, but sometimes attackers load malicious DLLs or abuse legitimate ones for their purposes.\n\nThe process creation events indicate that PowerShell is starting multiple times, which could be normal if running scripts, but repeated starts without clear reason might raise suspicion.\n\nTaking all this into account, the combination of repeated PowerShell executions, file checks, and profile modifications suggests potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that someone has given me. Each line is a JSON object representing some system activity. My job is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, let's break down each event:\n\n1. The first event shows PowerShell.exe creating a file in the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. I know that PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has so many capabilities, both legitimate and malicious. The creation of a new file could be part of setting up persistence or storing some configuration.\n\n2. Next, there's another event where PowerShell.exe sets a registry value. Registry modifications are common in attacks to maintain persistence, change system configurations, or hide malicious activities. I should note that this is the second time PowerShell has been involved in an activity.\n\n3. The third event involves conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is usually related to console windows and isn't typically associated with malicious activities on its own. However, if it's being used alongside other suspicious processes, it might be worth looking into whether this is part of some exploit or persistence mechanism.\n\n4. Then there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack component for log shipping. Its activity here seems normal unless it's accessing unexpected locations or showing unusual behavior, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\n5. Another PowerShell.exe event sets another registry value. This repetition of registry writes from the same process could indicate that something is trying to establish persistence in multiple places or change system settings.\n\n6. Finally, there's a ProcessAccess event from PowerShell.exe. This suggests that PowerShell is accessing some other process, which might be legitimate if it's interacting with system services, but it could also be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation if the accessed process isn't expected.\n\nPutting this all together, I'm concerned because several events involve PowerShell.exe performing actions that are common in attack chains. The combination of file creation and multiple registry modifications stands out as potentially malicious behavior. While conhost.exe's activity is less concerning on its own, it's worth considering whether it's part of a broader attack vector.\n\nI should also consider the context: Are these events spread out over time, or are they happening in quick succession? Without timestamps, it's hard to say, but the repetition of registry writes and involvement of PowerShell could indicate malicious activity like setting up persistence mechanisms or deploying payloads.\n\nMoreover, the file created by winlogbeat.exe seems legitimate, so that event on its own isn't a red flag. However, if all these events are part of a user's normal activity, they might not be suspicious. But given that multiple registry writes from PowerShell and conhost could indicate tampering with system configurations.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of activities involving PowerShell.exe and potential registry modifications is concerning. There's a pattern suggesting possible malicious behavior, though I can't be 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve powershell.exe performing actions that may indicate malicious activity, including file creation and registry modifications, which are common in attack chains.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
