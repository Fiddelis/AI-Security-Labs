{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are two events where \"python.exe\" is loading images from the Python DLLs path. That seems normal because Python uses these DLLs for its operations. No red flags here; it's just standard behavior.\n\nNext up, I notice that \"winlogbeat.exe\" created a file in the data directory with a .yml.new extension. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting and forwarding log data, so creating configuration files is expected. It doesn't look suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are three events involving \"SDXHelper.exe\" making DNS queries. SDXHelper might be part of some legitimate software or monitoring tools that need to check in with a server. However, multiple DNS queries could indicate something more if the domain queried seems malicious or if it's contacting known bad domains. Without knowing the specific domains, it's hard to say, but repeated DNS lookups can sometimes be signs of malicious activity like command and control communications.\n\nLastly, \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" is setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is a Windows process that typically handles user runtime privileges, so this action is normal and not concerning on its own.\n\nPutting all these events together, the only potentially suspicious part is the multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe. If I were to investigate further, I'd check the specific domains being queried to see if they're associated with known threats or if there's an unusual pattern in the requests. However, based on the information given, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior beyond that.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe and file creation events may indicate potential malicious activity or irregular system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be a red flag if there's unusual activity. The first event shows that powershell.exe deleted a file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1 in the Temp directory. That's interesting because scripts with .ps1 extensions are PowerShell scripts, and deleting them might indicate something malicious trying to remove traces.\n\nNext, there's a series of Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe. These seem normal as they're part of the process initialization, but combined with other events, they might warrant closer look.\n\nThen, HxTsr.exe is setting a registry value. I'm not familiar with this process off the top of my head, so that's a bit concerning. Registry modifications can be legitimate or malicious, depending on context. It doesn't stand alone as suspicious, but it adds to the picture.\n\nLooking at Python-related processes: py.exe and python.exe are being executed. The command lines show they're launching from the Python Launcher and the actual Python installation. There's a lot of Image Load events for various DLLs and .pyd files, which is typical when running Python scripts as they load their modules. However, if these processes are part of an automated or unexpected script execution, especially alongside the PowerShell activity, it might be worth investigating.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of deleting a potentially malicious script (the .ps1 file), multiple process creations and accesses, along with registry modifications and Python executions, raises some red flags. It's possible that this batch of events is part of an attack chain where an adversary is trying to execute scripts, perhaps using both PowerShell and Python for different stages or to bypass detection.\n\nWhile there's no concrete evidence of malicious activity yet, the pattern looks non-ordinary enough that it should be flagged for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe and file deletions along with process creations and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior requiring investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" with Image Load tasks loading system32 files like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems normal because these are common Windows system files being loaded by a process. It happens often when applications start up.\n\nNext, there's taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is also standard since Task Scheduler uses that DLL. Then services.exe has a Logon event, which could be legitimate as part of service initialization.\n\nI notice several Dns query events from SDXHelper.exe. While DNS queries can be malicious in some contexts, this alone doesn't raise a red flag without seeing unusual domains or repeated failed attempts.\n\nThere's an entry for winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so it's normal for it to create configuration files there.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe events: It loads various .NET and CLR components, which is expected when PowerShell runs scripts. The creation of a temporary .ps1 file could be suspicious, but without seeing the content or other indicators like dropped files or network traffic, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, svchost.exe and Explorer.EXE have registry events. Svchost is known for running services, so that's normal. Registry changes can be part of legitimate operations, especially during software installations or updates.\n\nThere's a process creation event for powershell.exe with an empty command line. That's a bit odd because usually you see the script being executed. But without more context, it might just be a hanging process or something not fully initialized.\n\nI don't see any clear signs of malicious activity like unusual file accesses, failed logins, network connections to known bad IPs, or execution of binaries in unexpected places. Most events are standard Windows processes loading normal DLLs and performing typical operations.\n\nSo putting this all together, while there are some points that could potentially be concerning, they don't collectively indicate malicious behavior. Therefore, the batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes and activities without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
