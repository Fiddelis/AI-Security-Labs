{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. That seems normal since it's likely the log collection service. Next, powershell.exe accessing a process and ssh.exe making a network connection. Hmm, SSH is a common tool, so that might be okay unless it's connecting to something suspicious.\n\nThen again, another winlogbeat creating a file. Powershell accessing processes again and creating a file in the user's .ssh folder. That could be interesting because .ssh is where keys are stored, but since it's powershell accessing it, maybe it's just routine.\n\nThere's an Explorer.EXE modifying the registry—that’s normal for Windows operations. Then several events of powershell.exe being created and loading various DLLs. The command line shows it's running as a regular PowerShell instance, which is standard unless there are signs of malicious scripts.\n\nI notice multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from PowerShell; that might indicate something like module loading or configuration, but without more context, it's hard to say. Then powershell.exe creates and deletes a temp file related to script policy testing. That could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies, which raises some flags.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"ImageLoad\" events for various DLLs, which is normal when running scripts or applications that require those libraries. The network connection from SSH might just be establishing an expected session, but without knowing the destination, it's a bit concerning.\n\nPutting this all together: There's a lot of PowerShell activity, especially creating and deleting files in temp directories, which could be indicators of malicious behavior like script testing or persistence mechanisms. However, some events are normal system operations, so I'm not sure if they're just part of the system running smoothly.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe performing actions that might indicate suspicious activity, such as creating and deleting temporary files which could be used for malicious scripts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in temp directory suggest potential script execution or testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nThe first few lines involve processes like winlogbeat.exe creating files and powershell.exe accessing processes. Then there are network connections detected by ssh.exe. Not too suspicious yet, but I'll keep an eye out for anything that repeats or seems out of place.\n\nI notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. Specifically, it's loading images and accessing various DLLs. That's not unusual on its own since PowerShell uses these components for scripting. However, the frequency might be a point to consider.\n\nThere are events where powershell.exe creates temporary files in the user's AppData directory. For example, creating \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1\" and then deleting it shortly after. This could indicate script execution as part of policy testing or legitimate script activity. But sometimes attackers use such files to execute malicious scripts temporarily.\n\nLooking at other events, there's a lot of file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely related to log shipping or monitoring. Ssh.exe also creates network connections, possibly for remote access but not inherently suspicious unless it's connecting to known bad IPs or behaving abnormally.\n\nA few events stand out where svchost.exe creates files in the Xbox Live directory and an AuthStateCache.dat file. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by services, so it's normal for it to create files. Unless there's evidence of tampering with these files or unusual access patterns, this might not be concerning.\n\nI also see repeated entries where powershell.exe loads the same DLLs and creates\/deletes temporary files. This repetition could suggest automated script execution or testing, but without additional context like timestamps or other anomalies, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nConsidering all these points, most activities appear to be part of normal system operations. The use of PowerShell for scripting is common, and processes like winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe performing file operations are expected. There's no clear indication of malicious behavior or unauthorized access in the provided events.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of event logs does not indicate any suspicious or malicious activity from a cybersecurity perspective. Most of the activities are related to normal system operations, including logging, monitoring, and legitimate process executions."}
