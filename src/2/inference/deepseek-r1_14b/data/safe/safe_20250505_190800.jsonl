{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's probably just the log shipping tool doing its job, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, mmc.exe setting a registry value. MMC is commonly used for managing system components, and it's normal to see registry changes from legitimate processes like this. Not a red flag.\n\nThen, Explorer.EXE also sets a registry value. Again, Windows Explorer interacts with the registry regularly, so that's expected behavior.\n\nThe next several events are all related to powershell.exe. The first one is just creating the process. Then there are multiple ImageLoad tasks, which means PowerShell is loading various DLLs. Some of these paths look like standard .NET framework and system components, which isn't unusual.\n\nThere are a few Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell. These are part of its normal operation when initializing or shutting down.\n\nI notice that a script file was created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. This is interesting because creating and immediately deleting a script might be an attempt to bypass some security policies, like script execution restrictions. Malware often does this to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe. While PowerShell can create pipes for legitimate reasons, combined with the script creation\/deletion, it raises some suspicion.\n\nThe events also show that the same command line is used multiple times for Provider Lifecycle tasks, which could indicate repeated attempts or process spawning, possibly part of a larger script execution.\n\nConsidering all these points together, especially the temporary script file and the pipe creation, this batch does seem relevant for further investigation. It's possible that malicious activity is being masked or tested here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows PowerShell creating a temporary script file and immediately deleting it, which may indicate an attempt to bypass security policies or test execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe is creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely updating its configuration. Then, powershell.exe creates a file called teste.ps1 in the Downloads folder. PowerShell scripts can be malicious, but just creating one isn't necessarily suspicious unless it's doing something bad.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creates another .winlog.yml.new file again. Maybe it's retrying or part of an update process. Not a red flag on its own.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing and loading images (DLLs). That's standard for PowerShell since it uses the .NET framework, so those image loads don't seem unusual.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe runs with some command-line arguments: ExecutionPolicy Bypass. Using -ExecutionPolicy Bypass is a common technique in scripts to bypass execution restrictions, which could be malicious, but sometimes admins use it legitimately too. It's something to note.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs related to .NET and others like mscoree.dll. These seem normal as part of the PowerShell environment.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates a temporary file in the local Temp folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. The name suggests it's testing script policy, but creating such files can be part of malicious activities to avoid detection or execute code.\n\nAfter that, it deletes the same temp file immediately. Deleting scripts after execution could indicate an attempt to cover tracks, which is a red flag for potential malware behavior.\n\nAnother FileCreate event in the StartupProfileData folder. That might be related to user profile initialization and not necessarily suspicious.\n\nLastly, there's an event labeled \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any file or process info. This could mean PowerShell executed something remotely, which again raises eyebrows because remote commands can be used maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe with ExecutionPolicy Bypass, creating and then deleting temp files quickly, along with executing a remote commandâ€”these are behaviors that often correlate with malware or script-based attacks. While some events could be benign, the combination is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe activities including execution policy bypass, file creation\/deletion in temp directory, and remote command execution suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
