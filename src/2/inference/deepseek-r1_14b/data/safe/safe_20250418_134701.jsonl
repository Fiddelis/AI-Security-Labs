{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm looking at this batch of events, all in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event. The first thing I notice is that every event has the same structure: it mentions \"git.exe\" as the process name, the task is \"File created\", and the file path points to different .d.ts files within a node_modules directory.\n\nHmm, so each event is about a file being created by git.exe. The paths all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. Then there are various filenames like pick.d.ts, pickAll.d.ts, and so on.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this batch is interesting for investigation. Let me break it down. git.exe is commonly used for version control in software development, especially with Node.js projects. The node_modules directory suggests that this might be part of a project setup or something related to npm packages.\n\nThe files being created are TypeScript definition files (d.ts). These are usually generated by tools like TypeScript to provide type information for JavaScript code. Cypress is a testing tool for web applications, and lodash is a popular utility library in JavaScript. So, these files are likely part of the Cypress types for lodash functions.\n\nNow, considering that each event is about creating such files, I'm thinking about what's normal here. When you install or update dependencies in a Node.js project, npm would download packages including their type definitions. Git might be involved if it's tracking these changes, perhaps during a build process or when initializing the project.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created sequentially could indicate that this is part of an automated setup process. It's possible that someone is setting up a new development environment and running commands that trigger these file creations. Alternatively, it might be part of CI\/CD pipelines where dependencies are being installed as part of the build steps.\n\nBut wait, why would git.exe create files? Normally, git itself doesn't create files; rather, it's used to manage existing ones. So maybe this is a script or command that runs git and also creates some supporting files during installation or setup.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior here? Well, the process name is a legitimate tool (git.exe), the task is a standard file creation event, and the paths are within a typical project structure. There's no sign of unusual file names or locations that would raise red flags. All these files are expected in a Node.js project using Cypress and lodash.\n\nI should also consider if repeated file creations could be a sign of something else, like a script running multiple times or a bug that causes redundant file writes. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure. However, based on the information given, these events don't exhibit any hallmarks of malicious activity such as access to sensitive files, execution of binaries, or communication with known bad domains.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes log parsers can flag certain activities as suspicious even if they're benign. In this case, multiple file creations by git.exe might not be common, but it's possible in a development scenario where scripts are automating setup processes.\n\nI'm leaning towards the conclusion that these events are normal and not indicative of any security issues. They likely stem from legitimate software development activities rather than malicious actions.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events describes multiple file creation operations by `git.exe` within a Node.js project's `node_modules` directory, specifically related to Cypress and lodash type definitions. These activities are typical during project setup or dependency installations, indicating benign software development processes rather than malicious behavior.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification:** Each event involves `git.exe`, which is a legitimate tool used for version control in software projects, especially with Node.js environments.\n\n2. **Task Analysis:** The task logs \"File created,\" which is standard for file system operations during setup or installation processes.\n\n3. **File Path Analysis:** The files are located within `node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp`, indicating they are part of a typical Node.js project's dependencies, specifically TypeScript definitions for Cypress and lodash utilities.\n\n4. **Event Frequency:** Multiple sequential events suggest an automated process, such as installing or updating project dependencies via npm, which might trigger these file creations.\n\n5. **Malicious Indicators Check:** There are no signs of suspicious file names, access to sensitive areas, or unusual network activities that would indicate malware behavior.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The activities are consistent with normal development practices and do not exhibit characteristics of malicious intent.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events are indicative of legitimate software development activities, specifically the creation of TypeScript definition files during a project setup or dependency installation using Node.js tools like npm and git. These actions do not suggest any cybersecurity threats or suspicious behavior."}

File creations during development are pretty standard, especially when working with tools like Git or Node.js. These events don't show any signs of being out of placeâ€”no unexpected file paths, unusual filenames, or deviations from typical user activity.\n\nI should consider the source of these files. The path includes \"node_modules,\" which is a common directory in JavaScript\/Node.js projects for storing dependencies. Lodash is a popular library used for utility functions, so it's expected to see its types being handled here.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and frequency isn't possible since I don't have that context, but each event shows the same process (git.exe) creating files in the same directory structure.

However, if these files were created at irregular intervals or outside of expected development hours, that could be more concerning.\n\nAnother angle is the use of git.exe.

It's normal for tools like Git to interact with node_modules as parts of version control operations, especially if scripts are running that modify these files.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The consistent use of Git and the creation of expected types files under node_modules aligns with typical software development workflows. Thereâ€™s no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file paths, or activities outside the scope of a developer environment.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesnâ€™t raise any red flags. It's likely just part of building or updating the project, so it's not interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by Git during development operations, specifically related to node_modules and Lodash types in a Cypress project.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, they all have the same process name: git.exe. That's interesting because Git is a version control tool commonly used in software development. It's not typically associated with malicious activities, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nEach event also mentions \"File created\" under winlog with the task being FileCreate. So it seems like these are file creation events triggered by the Git process. The paths all point to files inside a node_modules folder, specifically under cypress\/types\/lodash. Node Modules is where npm packages are stored, and Lodash is a popular JavaScript utility library. This makes sense because when working with frameworks like Cypress, you'd have various modules installed here.\n\nNow, looking at the file names, they're all .d.ts files, which are TypeScript declaration files. These are part of the type definitions for different functions and classes in TypeScript projects. It's normal for these files to be created or modified during development, especially when setting up a project with node_modules.\n\nThe repetition of similar eventsâ€”each one creating a file under the same directory structureâ€”suggests that this is part of a standard setup process. Git might be cloning a repository, installing dependencies via npm, which then creates all these type definition files. This is pretty typical in development environments when you're initializing a new project or updating existing ones.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The paths are all within expected locations for a development setup, and the process involved (git.exe) is commonly used in such contexts. There's no indication of unusual file creation patterns or access to sensitive areas outside the project directory. Each event seems consistent with legitimate software development activities.\n\nSo putting it all together, these logs likely come from a developer setting up or working on a JavaScript or TypeScript project using Git and npm. Since there's nothing irregular in the files being created or the process involved, I don't see any signs of malicious behavior or security incidents here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development setup and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The key details in each are:\n\n- **Process**: The name is \"git.exe\". So whatever action happened was done by the Git executable.\n- **Winlog Task**: It says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". That means a file was created, and there's a rule associated with that event called FileCreate.\n- **File Path**: Each event has a different path under the same directory. The paths are all inside a folder named after a course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\") which translates to \"Quality of Software\" in Portuguese. Specifically, they're creating files in `node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash`.\n\nLooking at the file names: isError.d.ts, isFinite.d.ts, etc., these seem like TypeScript definition files for various utility functions from lodash. Lodash is a popular JavaScript library with utilities, and having type definitions makes sense when using it in projects that use TypeScript.\n\nSo all events are about creating files related to Lodash types during a Git process. Since the user's path includes \"node_modules\" and \"cypress\", it looks like they're working on a project that uses Node.js (hence node_modules) and possibly Cypress for testing, which often involves TypeScript.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The files being created are standard type definitions, and the process is git.exe, which could be part of a script or build process adding these files to the repository. There's no indication of anything suspicious like access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, attempts to execute code, or creation of unexpected files.\n\nThe fact that all events are similar and involve creating multiple .d.ts files under the same path is consistent with normal development activities, especially if this is part of a build step where types are being generated or added. It's unlikely to be malicious since such activity wouldn't typically involve creating so many specific type files in a loop unless it's automated by a tool.\n\nAlso, considering that each file creation event is for a different utility function from lodash, it reinforces the idea that this is part of setting up type definitions for a project using these utilities. There's no deviation or anomaly in the paths or filenames that would raise red flags.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor such events, there's nothing here that suggests malicious behavior or a security incident. It looks like standard file creation during development.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of TypeScript definition files for Lodash utilities during a Git process, which is typical in a software development environment and does not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each event is a JSON object with information about a file creation task involving the git.exe process. All the events are from the same user and path, which seems to be related to node_modules and Cypress types. \n\nFirst off, I notice that every single entry has the same process name: git.exe. The tasks are all \"File created\" under the same rule, FileCreate. The file paths vary but they're all within a node_modules directory for Cypress and Lodash. This suggests that these files are part of a development environment, likely someone working on a software project using tools like Git, Node.js, and Cypress.\n\nI'm thinking about whether this activity is normal. Git is commonly used in development environments, especially when dealing with version control. The creation of multiple files under node_modules could be related to installing or updating dependencies. Since all these events are happening in the same directory, it seems like a standard part of the build process for a project.\n\nI also consider if there's anything unusual about the file paths. They're all .d.ts files, which I believe are TypeScript declaration files. This is typical when working with TypeScript projects as they define interfaces and types. There's nothing malicious in these file names or locations that I can seeâ€”nothing related to known malware or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if these events occurred over a short period, it could indicate a bulk operation like installing multiple packages at once. Alternatively, it might be part of a script running during setup or build processes. Either way, this doesn't raise any red flags for me.\n\nI also check if there's any variation in the process name or other fields that might hint at something more serious. Everything is consistent, which aligns with normal development activities rather than anything nefarious.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory during setup or build processes are expected behaviors in a software development environment. There's no indication of unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or data exfiltration here. The activity is consistent with legitimate user actions, making the batch not particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal file creation activities by git.exe during development, specifically related to node_modules and Cypress types.

Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and decide if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nLet me start by examining what each event looks like. They all have similar structures: a \"process\" field with the name set to \"git.exe\", a \"winlog\" field indicating that a file was created, and a \"file\" path pointing to various locations in a directory structure under \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\".\n\nI notice that each event is about creating a new file. The file paths are all within the \"node_modules\" folder of a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Specifically, they're in the \"cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\" directory, which suggests these are TypeScript files related to Cypress testing tools.\n\nThe same process name is repeated: git.exe. Git is commonly used for version control and often runs scripts or commands that might involve file creation as part of its operations, like cloning repositories or running tests. The activity here seems consistent with normal development workâ€”perhaps someone is setting up a project, installing dependencies, or running tests.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't provided, but considering there are multiple entries with similar structures, it's likely these events happened in quick succession as part of a script or automated process during a build or test run. This kind of activity is typical in CI\/CD pipelines or when developers work on projects using tools like npm or yarn.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All the file paths are within expected project directories, and the process name aligns with normal git operations. There's no indication of access to restricted areas, attempts to execute foreign scripts, or other red flags that would suggest malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, the creation of multiple files in a row under a known development tool's directory (node_modules) is a common occurrence when installing or updating packages. For example, if someone runs `npm install` and Cypress is being installed or updated, it might create several type definition files as part of the installation process.\n\nTherefore, considering all these pointsâ€”consistent file creation under a standard project structure by a legitimate processâ€”it doesn't seem like this batch of events would warrant further investigation. They appear to be normal development activities rather than signs of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe within the node_modules directory, which is typical during development or installation processes and does not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

This suggests it's part of a script or automated process since multiple files are being created in quick succession. The file paths are all within the node_modules folder, which is typical for npm packages. Specifically, these files are type definitions (.d.ts) from the lodash library used by Cypress.\n\nThe fact that the same process creates multiple files isn't unusual on its own. Developers often clone repositories or run scripts that generate several files. However, I should consider if this activity is out of the ordinary for a system. Since git.exe is involved, it's likely related to version control operations like cloning, updating, or checking out files.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. The file paths are standard and expected in a development environment using Node.js and Cypress. There's no indication of unusual file names, execution paths, or access patterns that might suggest an attack.\n\nBut wait, could there be something I'm missing? Sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious activities. Could git.exe be part of a larger campaign? In this case, though, the files being created are standard type definitions, which don't execute code on their own. They're just metadata for TypeScript.\n\nAlso, considering that all events are from the same user (fiddelis) and target an educational directory (S206 - Qualidade de Software), it seems like normal development activity. There's no evidence of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or other red flags typical in malicious activities.\n\nI should also think about confidence levels. Since all events are consistent with expected behavior and there's no deviation from what's normal for a git process creating files, the confidence that this batch is not interesting is high. Maybe around 0.95 on a scale of 0 to 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the events are part of a legitimate development process, specifically related to setting up or updating a project's dependencies.

The winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created. The file paths all point to different .d.ts files inside the node_modules folder for cypress and lodash.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's normal in a system environment. Git is often used for version control, especially in development environments. Node.js modules like Cypress are common in web development for testing. Lodash is a popular utility library for JavaScript, so it makes sense that these files are present.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all end with .d.ts, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files.

It's not uncommon for build tools or package managers to use Git commands during their operations.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual processes, no access to sensitive files, and all activities are within the expected scope of a development environment. The repetition is due to multiple TypeScript declaration files being created, which aligns with typical software development workflows.\n\nConsidering confidence, I'm fairly certain these events aren't suspicious.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that the user provided. Each event is a JSON object representing some activity on a Windows system. Let me try to parse what's going on here.\n\nFirst, each line starts with \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\" which tells me that the Git executable is involved in these actions. That makes sense because Git is often used for version control and might be running scripts or commands that interact with files.\n\nNext, looking at the \"winlog\" field, every event has a task description of \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So each of these events is indicating that a file was created. The \"file\" field then specifies the path where the file was created, which all seem to be under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames like sample.d.ts, sampleSize.d.ts, and so on.\n\nI'm noticing that each file path ends with .d.ts. From what I recall, .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files. These are typically generated automatically by tools to provide type information for JavaScript or TypeScript projects. In the context of Node.js modules like Cypress (which is a testing framework), having multiple .d.ts files being created makes sense during development or when dependencies are installed or updated.\n\nThe process name being git.exe suggests that Git might be running some command, perhaps installing or updating packages via npm, which could trigger the creation of these TypeScript declaration files. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a build process where these files are generated as part of compiling TypeScript code.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: 18 separate file creations, all in the same directory, all with .d.ts extensions, and all initiated by git.exe. This seems like a normal occurrence during development work, especially if someone is using Git for version control alongside tools like npm or yarn for managing packages.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The files are standard TypeScript declarations, which are usually not malicious in nature. Malicious activities might involve creating hidden files, modifying system configurations, accessing restricted areas, or showing up at unusual times (like late at night with no user activity). Here, everything is happening in a predictable location related to software development tools and modules.\n\nAlso, the consistency across all eventsâ€”same process name, same task type, similar file paths and extensionsâ€”doesn't raise any suspicion. If there were variations or inconsistencies, that might warrant closer investigation, but as it stands, this looks routine.\n\nAnother point is that the paths are deep within a user's Downloads folder under an \"inatel\" directory, which seems like it could be a school or institution's name. This suggests it's a personal development environment rather than a server or production system, where such activity would be more expected during development hours.\n\nI also consider whether Git itself could be involved in malicious activities, but Git is a version control tool primarily used for collaboration and tracking changes. While it can execute arbitrary code through hooks, unless there's a known vulnerability or specific configuration, it's not inherently dangerous just because it's running.\n\nIn summary, these events don't indicate any suspicious activity. They appear to be part of the normal build or setup process for a TypeScript project using tools like Git and npm. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, file deletions, or other signs that would suggest a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events represents normal development activities involving the creation of TypeScript declaration files by Git.exe.
