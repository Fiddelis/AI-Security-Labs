{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving different processes like PowerShell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe, conhost.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Each event has a 'process' field with the name of the executable and sometimes the command line arguments, along with a 'winlog' task indicating what action was taken.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't provided here, but I can infer activity based on the events. The tasks include Process Create, Registry value set, File created, and Process accessed. Notably, there are several instances where PowerShell.exe is accessing processes and modifying registry values. For example:\n\n- Multiple entries show 'powershell.exe' being accessed or creating files.\n- cmd.exe is used in command lines that add registry entries to HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, which typically relates to startup programs.\n- reg.exe is also used to modify the same registry key, further indicating potential persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe repeated use of these tools suggests an attempt to maintain persistence or execute malicious activities. The creation of files like 'modulo_padrao.txt' and changes in '.winlogbeat.yml.new' might be part of setting up a beacon or for other malicious purposes.\n\nConsidering the combination of process creations, registry modifications, and file operations, especially using tools commonly associated with scripting attacks (like PowerShell), it's reasonable to suspect potentially malicious behavior. While some events could be benign, the pattern here raises red flags.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole is classified as INTERESTING because it exhibits signs that might indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations and registry modifications using tools like PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe suggest potential malicious activity, such as establishing persistence or executing scripts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
