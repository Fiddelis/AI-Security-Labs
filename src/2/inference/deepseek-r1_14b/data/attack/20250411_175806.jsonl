{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm looking at a batch of system log events in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event with process info, windows logs, and sometimes files involved.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is accessing or creating processes. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities like executing commands or downloading files. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might raise some flags.\n\nThen there are cmd.exe instances running REG ADD commands. These look like they're modifying the Windows Registry, specifically targeting HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That path is often where startup programs are stored, so adding entries here could indicate an attempt to create a persistent backdoor or malicious software that runs on startup.\n\nLooking further, I see reg.exe being used as well. REG.EXE is a legitimate tool for modifying the registry, but when combined with unusual commands and other suspicious activities, it might be part of an attack vector. The command lines show adding values like \"registro_auxiliar\" and \"entrada_principal,\" which don't seem to have standard meanings—could be custom keys used by malware.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe creating a file in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modules padrão.txt, which might not be suspicious on its own, but when combined with other activities, it could be part of an infection process where malicious files are being written or downloaded.\n\nAdditionally, conhost.exe is involved in registry changes. Conhost.exe usually hosts console windows for applications like command prompt, so if it's modifying the registry without a clear purpose, that might not be normal and could hint at some background activity.\n\nAnother thing to note is the multiple instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks. Frequent access to processes or registry modifications can be signs of malicious behavior, especially when combined with other indicators like using powershell.exe multiple times.\n\nLastly, the winlogbeat.exe entries seem legitimate, as it's an ELK stack tool used for log shipping, but if it's being manipulated in a way that affects logs or data integrity, that could be concerning. However, from the provided events, they don't show any malicious activity beyond creating files, which might be part of their normal operation.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of powershell.exe access, registry modifications via cmd.exe and reg.exe, and file creation by multiple processes points towards potential malicious activities aimed at establishing persistence on the system. While there's no direct evidence of harmful actions like downloading malware or executing malicious scripts in these logs, the pattern suggests a high likelihood of an attack being prepared or executed.\n\nI should also consider whether this activity could be part of legitimate administration tasks. However, the use of multiple tools and the specific registry keys targeted make it less likely to be routine admin work. The repeated attempts to modify system settings through various means are red flags that need attention.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation and registry modifications involving potentially malicious tools like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe indicate possible unauthorized system activity. The targeted registry keys suggest attempts at creating persistent backdoors or installing malware.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
