{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. So, I'm looking at a batch of events from various processes, mainly PowerShell and whoami.exe. My task is to determine if these logs are interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst off, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed (ProcessAccess) and created (ProcessCreate). That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's being launched several times might indicate something suspicious, like script execution or payload delivery.\n\nLooking closer at the command line of one of the powershell.exe processes, I see an encoded command: \"& {import-module \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\\\"...\". That's a red flag. Encoded commands or scripts are commonly used to bypass detection mechanisms and execute malicious code. The script is being imported, which suggests it might be doing something nefarious.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events for different DLLs when running PowerShell. While some of these are legitimate .NET framework components, the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender could indicate that the process is attempting to load antivirus components, possibly to disable or evade detection mechanisms.\n\nThere's also a file creation event in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1\". This seems like a temporary script file created by PowerShell. The fact that it's deleted shortly after might be an attempt to clean up evidence, which is common in malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the PipeCreated event from powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but in this context, it could be part of a more complex attack chain, such as setting up a reverse shell or command and control communication.\n\nThe whoami.exe process seems less concerning on its own, as it's typically used to get user information. However, when combined with the other events, it might not contribute much unless it's part of a larger sequence.\n\nI also notice that svchost.exe is creating a log file in SoftwareDistribution and making registry changes. While svchost is a legitimate process, unusual activity from it could indicate a service being misused or a potential backdoor.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines, script execution in Temp, DLL loading that includes antivirus components, and file deletions all point towards potentially malicious behavior. The encoded script and attempts to load defender-related DLLs suggest an attempt to hide or escalate privileges.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, including encoding and script importation, along with file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me start by looking through each one and seeing what's going on.\n\nThe first event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Runtime Broker handles various Windows services and often interacts with the registry. Next, HxTsr.exe also sets a registry value—HxTsr might be part of some system tool or service. Then there's svchost.exe doing the same thing; svchost is known to run many services, so this could just be regular activity.\n\nThe fourth event switches to sppsvc.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\store\\... SPP is related to Software Protection, so that makes sense. Powershell.exe comes up next, both creating a file and setting registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The fact that it's writing to the StartupProfileData might be interesting—it could indicate script execution on startup.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe is involved in multiple ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are standard DLLs for URL handling and background intelligent transfer service proxy, so nothing unusual there. However, I notice that svchost.exe is creating several files under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download... This path seems a bit off because it's not the typical location where svchost would operate. It might be trying to create or drop files in non-standard directories.\n\nThe fact that multiple events involve the same process (svchost.exe) writing to similar paths raises my concern. While svchost is a common process,批量创建文件在非典型路径可能表明异常行为，尤其是在没有明显关联的情况下。此外，powershell的活动也值得警惕，因为它常被用于恶意脚本执行。\n\n综合来看，虽然单独的事件看似正常，但组合起来可能存在隐藏的恶意行为，比如潜在的进程注入或文件操作异常。这种情况下，需要进一步调查这些文件的目的以及它们是否与已知恶意软件相关联。\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe in unusual paths, along with PowerShell activity, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Most of them are from svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process and usually not suspicious on its own. The tasks involved are mainly registry changes and file creations.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries where svchost.exe sets registry values—this could be normal system activity or part of some malicious behavior trying to hide itself. However, looking at the files created, they seem related to Windows updates and logs, like waasmedic.etl and edbtmp.log. These types of files are typically associated with legitimate system processes.\n\nThere's a file creation in C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download... which is where Windows Update stores its files. That doesn't raise any red flags for me because it's part of the update process. The other entries with .etl extensions are likely event trace logs, which are standard for various services.\n\nI don't see any unusual file paths or indicators of malicious activity like executable writes to unexpected locations or attempts to execute scripts. The repetition of svchost.exe might seem concerning, but given that it's performing tasks like registry edits and creating log files, it aligns with normal operations.\n\nIn summary, while the frequency of events is notable, there's no clear evidence of malicious intent in these logs. Therefore, I classify this batch as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show svchost.exe performing normal system tasks such as registry modifications and file creation related to Windows updates and logs, which are typical activities and do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything that stands out.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. The process is svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal because svchost is a common Windows process used by services. Registry writes are typical for it.\n\n2. Another event from svchost.exe creates a file in C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install. This path seems standard for Windows updates or patches. So, creating files here isn't unusual.\n\n3. The next event again is svchost.exe creating another file: AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. It looks like a patch file, which fits with the update directory. Still, nothing suspicious so far.\n\nThen I see events from MpSigStub.exe. This is related to Windows Defender. The process loads some DLLs and creates several files in C:\\Windows\\Temp. These seem to be temporary files for updating virus definitions or handling patches. Creating temp files is normal during such processes.\n\nThere are multiple FileCreate tasks by MpSigStub.exe, each with unique filenames. They all end with .vdm or similar extensions, which I think are related to Defender's update process. So these activities are expected and not concerning.\n\nNext, setup.exe creates several files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. These include BHOs (Browser Helper Objects), cookie exporters, and other services. This is part of normal software installation and updates, especially for Edge, which might be updating its components.\n\nThen there's MsMpEng.exe loading a DLL, which again ties to Windows Defender's engine. It's standard behavior for that service.\n\nFinally, RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value—normal as it's part of the Windows runtime services—and powershell.exe being accessed, which is common and doesn't indicate anything malicious unless other indicators are present.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual processes or activities outside normal operations. All the processes involved (svchost, MpSigStub, setup.exe, MsMpEng, RuntimeBroker) are standard Windows components or legitimate software update mechanisms. The file paths and tasks align with their expected behavior.\n\nNo events show unauthorized access, writes to unexpected locations, or other red flags like network communications or encryption activities that might indicate malware. Everything looks routine, which makes me lean towards this batch not being particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis concludes that the batch of log events does not exhibit any concerning or unusual behavior indicative of a cybersecurity issue. All processes and activities are within normal operational parameters for standard system updates and legitimate software operations.\n\n**Answer:** The batch is not interesting; it represents normal system and software update activities without any signs of malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal; it's a common tool used to get user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The second event shows powershell accessing something, then setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're often part of legitimate scripts but also commonly used by malware for persistence or configuration.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, the command line is quite long and suspicious. It includes creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to some .exe file. This stands out because creating a new service could be a way for malicious actors to establish persistence on the system. The path seems unusual too, with backslashes and what looks like encoded text.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell is accessing files, loading images, and creating pipes. These activities aren't inherently bad but when combined with previous actions can raise flags. For example, loading various .NET frameworks might be normal for script execution, but the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory look suspicious. Creating a temp file and then deleting it immediately could be an attempt to evade detection or test permissions.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry writes by both powershell.exe and services.exe. Services often interact with the registry, so that might not be alarming yet. However, if these writes are modifying sensitive areas like service configurations or security policies, they could indicate malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a sequence starting with whoami, then powershell accessing and modifying the registry, creating a new service, loading various libraries, creating and deleting temp files, and establishing pipes. This chain of events resembles typical behaviors of malware trying to establish persistence, execute commands, and clean up evidence. The creation of a new service suggests an attempt to run code at startup, which is a common tactic for attackers.\n\nWhile some actions could be legitimate (like script execution), the combination—especially the creation of a new service with a suspicious binary path—is concerning enough to merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell activities, including registry modifications and file operations, which may indicate malicious behavior such as creating a new service or attempting persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's take a closer look at the data provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that there are multiple entries from \"tarefa_logico.exe\" loading various .NET framework files. These include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. This seems like normal behavior because these are standard components of the .NET framework used by many applications. So individually, each event might not raise any red flags.\n\nThen, there's a shift in the events where \"powershell.exe\" starts appearing. The first event from powershell.exe is about creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory under the user's AppData folder. That's a bit unusual because non-interactive profiles shouldn't have much activity, so this could be something to look into.\n\nNext, there are events where PowerShell sets registry values and executes remote commands. The remote command path is pointing to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script name is a bit generic, but the fact that it's being executed remotely could indicate malicious activity like script execution from untrusted locations.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where PowerShell is invoked with a command line that imports this same script and tries to execute Invoke-entrada_principal. The script is attempting to run in the user's Temp directory, which is another red flag because it's writing to a common area where malicious actors might drop files.\n\nThe repetition of these PowerShell commands six times (from lines 9 to 14) suggests persistence or multiple attempts to run the same script, possibly indicating an attempt to hide or retry execution after failure. This kind of repetitive behavior is often seen in attacks to ensure the payload runs successfully.\n\nAlso, there are events where both process and winlog fields are \"None,\" which might indicate incomplete logging or potential tampering with logs, making it harder to track the activities accurately.\n\nPutting all this together: normal .NET loading from a single process followed by suspicious PowerShell activity, including file creation, registry changes, remote command execution, repeated script imports, and attempts to write to temporary directories. These actions don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate malicious intent like installing malware or creating persistence mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, the batch is interesting for investigation because it shows signs of potentially unauthorized or harmful activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activity including remote command execution, repeated script imports, and attempts to write to temporary directories, which may indicate malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system activity. My job is to analyze the entire batch together and decide if it's something we need to investigate.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that many of them are PowerShell commands being executed. The command lines show scripts importing modules and creating services. Specifically, there's a script called `componente_auxiliar.ps1` in a path like `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario`. That seems a bit off because those folder names translate to \"logical unit\" and \"secondary registry,\" which are terms that might not be standard, possibly indicating something malicious.\n\nThen, there's the use of `New-Service` cmdlets to create a service named `objeto_ativo`, which translates to \"active object.\" Services created by scripts can sometimes be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The fact that this is happening multiple times across different events makes me think it's not just an isolated incident but part of a larger process.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the `Import-Module` command in the first event, which suggests they're loading some module from a specific path. Malware often uses such techniques to hide its components or load malicious scripts. The fact that this script is being imported and then executed with `Invoke-entrada_principal` (which translates to \"invoke-main entry\") further raises suspicions.\n\nLooking at the winlog fields, I see tasks like 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle', which are related to service creation and management. While these are legitimate activities, the combination of multiple such events in quick succession might indicate automated or malicious behavior trying to establish persistence on the system.\n\nAlso, there's an event where `Execute a Remote Command` is logged, pointing to the same script path. This could mean that the script is being executed remotely, which is another red flag for potential remote access attacks or command execution.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of these events—like creating the same service multiple times and executing the same PowerShell commands—is concerning. It suggests either a legitimate process that's running in a loop unnecessarily or something more nefarious like a botnet activity or persistence mechanism being established.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious activities: using PowerShell to create services, importing modules from non-standard paths, and executing remote commands. These indicators could be part of an attack vector trying to maintain presence on the system or spread further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to create a service using PowerShell, execute scripts from non-standard paths, and remote command execution. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are several entries here, and they all seem to be in JSONL format. Each line is a separate JSON object containing information about processes, Windows logs, and file paths.\n\nStarting with the first event: it has \"process\" set to None, which might mean no associated process was detected or logged. The \"winlog\" field shows that the task was 'Execute a Remote Command'. That immediately raises some flags because executing remote commands can be a common tactic in cyberattacks, like remote code execution or command and control communication.\n\nThe file path mentioned is 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. This looks suspicious for a few reasons. PowerShell scripts are often used by attackers due to their powerful scripting capabilities and the ability to execute commands. The presence of a .ps1 file in this context could indicate malicious activity, especially if it's being executed remotely.\n\nLooking further down, I notice that there are multiple entries with the same \"winlog\" task of 'Execute a Remote Command' and the exact same file path. This repetition suggests potential automated or batched execution attempts. Such patterns are often seen in attacks where an adversary tries to execute malicious scripts repeatedly to gain access or persistence.\n\nThere are also a couple of events where the process is 'services.exe' with tasks like 'Logon'. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but when combined with repeated logon activities, it could indicate credential dumping or lateral movement within the network. Additionally, some entries have 'Special Logon', which might be indicative of non-interactive sessions that are sometimes used by attackers for persistence.\n\nThe fact that many events don't reference any file path and others do makes me think there's a mix of activity—some legitimate processes alongside potentially malicious ones. However, the sheer number of 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks with the same PowerShell script is concerning.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems like this batch could be relevant for investigation. The repetitive execution of a remote command via a PowerShell script is a red flag that might indicate an ongoing attack or at least suspicious activity that needs to be looked into further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks targeting the same PowerShell script suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. They're all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event: It has \"process\":\"None\", so no process information. The \"winlog\" field shows that the task was \"Execute a Remote Command\". There's also a file path provided, pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". That seems suspicious because it's a PowerShell script, which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's being executed remotely could be a red flag.\n\nI check the next few events and notice they're all identical to the first one. Each line has the same structure: \"Execute a Remote Command\" task and the same file path. This repetition makes me think this activity is part of a larger pattern or possibly a script that's running multiple times. Now, seeing that several entries are exactly the same could indicate either legitimate repeated tasks or something more nefarious like an automated attack.\n\nAs I go further down the list, I see some variations. There are events where \"winlog\" task is \"Windows Update Agent\", which seems normal as Windows regularly checks for updates. Then, towards the end, there's another event with the same remote command and file path again. So overall, most of the events are about executing a remote command on this specific PowerShell script.\n\nI should consider whether repeated attempts to execute the same remote command could be malicious. It might be part of an attack where the script is trying to establish persistence or perform some unauthorized task. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate process that's running multiple times for different reasons, but the exact repetition and the use of PowerShell are concerning.\n\nThe file path itself looks unusual. \"C:\\unidade_logico\" translates to \"Logical Unit\" in Portuguese, which isn't a standard directory on Windows systems. That might indicate that this is a custom or potentially malicious script being stored in an atypical location. Also, the fact that it's called from multiple events suggests it's being executed by different processes or under different contexts.\n\nAnother point is that most of the entries have \"process\":\"None\", which means there's no associated process information. This could mean that the logs are either incomplete or that the event is being captured at a lower level where process details aren't available. In some cases, attackers might use such events to mask their activities by not associating them with specific processes.\n\nI also notice that near the end of the log, there's an entry where \"winlog\" task is \"None\", and both file and process are null. This breaks the pattern a bit but could be either an error in logging or part of the normal update agent logs I saw earlier. However, it doesn't change the overall picture that most events are about executing this remote command.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some legitimate-looking entries like Windows Update Agent tasks, the overwhelming majority are repeated attempts to execute a remote PowerShell script from an unusual path. This combination of factors raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The repetition could indicate automated behavior, which is often a sign of compromise or attack.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows signs of possible unauthorized access or suspicious activities that merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to execute a remote command on a PowerShell script from an unusual file path, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
