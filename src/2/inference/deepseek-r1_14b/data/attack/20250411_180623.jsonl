{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a bunch of log events to analyze, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the batch, there are multiple entries from different processes: powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The tasks involve file creation, registry events, and process access. \n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit unusual because typically, scripts or tools might want persistence here. I've heard that attackers sometimes use PowerShell for malicious activities, so this could be a red flag.\n\nThe second and third events are both about registry value sets by powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're often used in attacks to maintain persistence or modify system configurations. However, without more context, it's hard to say if these are malicious.\n\nNext, there are two entries from winlogbeat.exe creating a file related to its configuration. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log management, so this seems normal unless the file path looks suspicious. The path here ends with .winlogbeat.yml.new, which appears standard for updates or backups, so I'm not too concerned about that.\n\nThen there's another powershell.exe event creating a file named estrutura_logico.txt in the Downloads folder. This name is Portuguese and translates to \"logical structure,\" which might be benign but could also hint at data collection or exfiltration.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing a processâ€”this kind of activity can be part of legitimate scripts, but it's also something attackers might do to hide their processes or inject code into existing ones. \n\nThe last entry is another winlogbeat file creation, which as I thought earlier, seems routine unless there's an inconsistency in how it's being used.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with actions that could be malicious. The combination of registry modifications and creating files in non-standard locations might indicate malicious activity. While some events are normal, others raise enough flags to warrant investigation. I'm not entirely sure, but my confidence is around 0.7 because while there are red flags, it's possible these activities are part of legitimate processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with file creation and registry modifications, potentially indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening here.\n\nThe first event is about chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That seems normal because Chrome often accesses the internet and would need to resolve domain names, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext up are several events related to powershell.exe. The second event shows that powershell set a registry value. I know that PowerShell can do a lot of things with the registry, but setting values in itself isn't necessarily bad unless it's for malicious purposes. However, without more context on what exactly was changed, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThe third event has PowerShell being created with a command line argument running {Get-Date}. That seems like a benign script because Get-Date just returns the current date and time. So that doesn't raise any red flags for me.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes, which again, is something PowerShell does regularly when scripting or executing commands. Not unusual unless it's accessing something it shouldn't.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad tasks from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, which PowerShell relies on, so that's expected behavior and not concerning on its own.\n\nNow, looking at the next few events, a file was created in the Temp directory by fiddelis with a name __PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1. That seems like it could be part of some script testing or policy checking. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. This create-delete sequence within a short time frame might be something to look into because attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting files they created.\n\nThere are also multiple Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe. These seem routine as part of PowerShell's operation when starting or stopping services, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell if these are part of a larger malicious process.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where a pipe was created by powershell.exe. This could be used for inter-process communication, which can be legitimate but also potentially malicious if used for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at all the events together, the repeated use of PowerShell with various operations including file creation\/deletion, registry changes, DLL loading, and pipe creation makes me cautious. While many of these actions are normal, the combination might indicate something more than just routine system activity. Especially the quick create-delete of a script in the Temp directory could be part of an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely certain because it's possible that this is part of legitimate administrative tasks or automated scripts running on the system. But given that there are multiple potentially suspicious activities linked to PowerShell, which is often targeted by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities, I think there's enough here to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple unusual PowerShell activities including file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, repeated registry modifications, and image loads. These actions could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
