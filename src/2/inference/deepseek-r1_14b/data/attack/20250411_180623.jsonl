{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at the events, I see a lot of entries from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in malicious activities. The first thing that catches my eye is the command line: \"& {Get-Date}\". Get-Date is a cmdlet that just returns the current date and time, so it's not immediately suspicious on its own. But when combined with other actions, it might be part of a larger script or payload.\n\nI notice multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading images. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware to ensure they restart after a system reboot. The image loads point to various DLLs, which could be normal for PowerShell if they're part of its operation, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries.\n\nThere's also a file creation and subsequent deletion event: the script creates a temp file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1 and then deletes it. This is concerning because creating and deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection or to test if scripts are allowed to run, which might indicate policy testing for bypassing restrictions.\n\nThe events mention different tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image load, File create, and delete. The fact that these all happen within the same process (powershell.exe) suggests a coordinated activity, possibly executing multiple steps in a script. The repetition of similar actions could be part of a loop or repeated commands, which is common in scripts meant to perform tasks over time.\n\nThe justification for classifying this as INTERESTING is because the combination of events indicates potential malicious behavior. Using powershell.exe with specific command lines and performing actions like registry modifications and file operations that could be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm confident at about 0.8 on a scale from 0 to 1 because while individual actions might not be suspicious, the pattern across multiple events raises red flags typical in attack campaigns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances show registry modifications and file operations that may indicate malicious activity such as persistence or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe doing file creation and registry changes. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Also, creating files in places like the Startup folder could mean persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is usually related to console windows but seeing it modifying the registry might be odd unless part of legitimate scripts.\n\nThere are two entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log management, so if that's running legitimately, those events are normal. But the path seems specific, and having .new in the filename could indicate a backup or something being written there.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing a process â€“ not sure what that's about without context, but it's another red flag.\n\nNow, looking at the combination: multiple PowerShell instances doing file and registry operations, conhost making changes, and winlogbeat creating files. It seems like a lot of activity from different processes that could be part of an attack chain. Maybe someone is trying to establish persistence or move laterally.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's just normal system behavior? If the user is running scripts or has certain tools installed, some of these activities might be legitimate. However, considering the frequency and types of actions (file creation in Startup folder, registry writes), it leans towards potentially malicious activity.\n\nI'm not 100% sure, but there's enough here to warrant closer investigation. So I'd classify this as interesting with a high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell.exe performing file creation and registry modifications, along with other processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe showing unusual activity that may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
