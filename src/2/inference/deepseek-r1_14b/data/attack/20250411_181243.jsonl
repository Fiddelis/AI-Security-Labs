{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nStarting with the first few events: there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and created. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The fact that it's appearing multiple times might indicate something suspicious, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events: it has a script that runs several commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe, and others. These commands are used to retrieve system information, which could be part of reconnaissance. The fact that they're chained together suggests an automated process or perhaps an attempt to gather information for later use.\n\nThere's also a file being created and then deleted in quick succession: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1. The creation and deletion of temporary files is common in malware to avoid detection, as it might try to remove evidence after execution.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry accesses and image loads from powershell.exe. This makes me think that the script is trying to modify system configurations or load certain modules, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes running scripts with administrative commands, temporary file creation\/deletion, and potential registry modifications. These activities are red flags for possible malicious behavior. The repeated use of powershell.exe and the specific commands used add to the suspicion. While not conclusive proof of an attack, these signs are significant enough that an investigation would be warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell execution with potentially malicious scripting, including file creation\/deletion and system commands indicative of Reconnaissance or Lateral Movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The commands inside the PowerShell script look suspicious. They include things like 'net user', which can list users, and 'get-localgroupmember -group Users' to get group members. There's also 'cmdkey.exe \/list' which shows saved credentials. Additionally, commands like 'ls C:\/Users' and 'dir C:\\Users' suggest the script is enumerating files in the Users directory. These actions could be part of credential dumping or lateral movement.\n\nLooking at other events, there are process creations for net.exe and net1.exe with command lines that also seem to target user enumeration. The repeated use of these commands across multiple events makes me think this activity is deliberate rather than random.\n\nThen there's the 'winlogbeat.exe' event creating a file. I know winlogbeat is used for log management, but seeing it create a new configuration file could be normal, but in this context, maybe it's being used as part of malicious activity to change logging settings or exfiltrate data.\n\nThe fact that so many events are related to user accounts and groups (Security Group Management) makes me concerned about potential privilege escalation or lateral movement. These activities often precede more serious attacks like ransomware or data breaches.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell scripts with specific commands, multiple attempts to access user information, and repeated group management tasks suggests a coordinated attack. The confidence level is high because these actions are common in early stages of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating suspicious PowerShell activity with commands potentially related to credential dumping and user enumeration, combined with repeated security group management tasks that may indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first two events are about Security Group Management tasks without any process or file information. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own.\n\nThen there's an event where cmdkey.exe is used with the command line \"\/list\". I know cmdkey.exe is related to managing credentials, so using it to list stored credentials could be a red flag if not expected. It might indicate credential dumping, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nNext, there are several PowerShell-related events. The first one shows that powershell.exe was accessed, and then it created a file named 'elemento_logico.txt' in the Downloads folder. That caught my attention because creating files with custom names can be part of malicious activities, especially if the name doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother event shows net.exe being used to list local groups. Using command-line tools like net.exe for group management is common but could also be a way to gather information about system groups during an attack.\n\nThere's a PowerShell file creation in the AppData folder related to StartupProfileData. This seems suspicious because attackers might try to create persistence mechanisms in such locations, especially using non-interactive profiles which are often targeted.\n\nMultiple registry writes by various processes, including powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe, stand out. Registry modifications can be part of installing malware or creating persistence points. The fact that multiple processes are doing this is concerning.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a config file in its own directory. While this might seem normal, it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like ELK components for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nNotepad and Calculator events don't look malicious at first glance, but the Calculator one loads urlmon.dll, which is unusual for such an application. URLMON.DLL is related to URL handling and could be used in malicious scripts.\n\nSeveral instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry are present. SvcHost is a common process, but it's often abused by malware, so these events need closer scrutiny.\n\nFinally, whoami.exe is run without arguments, which seems benign on its own but can be part of information gathering during an attack.\n\nPutting all this together, there are multiple red flags: use of cmdkey.exe for credential dumping, PowerShell activity with file creations in unusual paths, registry modifications by various processes, and the use of command-line tools like net.exe. These activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, especially since they cover multiple aspects of system compromise and persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including credential dumping with cmdkey.exe, PowerShell file creation in non-standard locations, registry modifications by various processes, and potential lateral movement tools being used.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
