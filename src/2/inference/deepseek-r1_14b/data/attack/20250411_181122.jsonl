Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a process named whoami.exe being created. That seems normal because it's a standard Windows tool used to display user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed multiple times with different tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access might be worth looking into.\n\nLooking further, there's a process where powershell.exe is run with a command line that includes searching for strings related to \"pass\" in various file types. The command uses findstr and select-string, which are tools often used to search for patterns. This specific pattern—looking for \"pass\" in common document types like .xml, .doc, .txt, .xls—could be an attempt to gather sensitive information such as passwords or credentials.\n\nAdditionally, the logs show that a temporary PowerShell script was created and then deleted shortly after. The creation of a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1 suggests it might have been part of some automated process or test. However, combined with the search for sensitive information, this could indicate an attempt to run malicious scripts without leaving a trace for long.\n\nThere are also several Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this is normal when running PowerShell scripts, the combination with other activities makes me cautious.\n\nAnother point is multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks being logged with the same command line. This repetition might indicate that the malicious process is attempting to run in different contexts or restart after failure.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe, searching for sensitive data, creation and deletion of a temporary script, and multiple attempts suggest potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing system resources and executing commands that could indicate credential harvesting.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

The user provided multiple events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Powershell Command Line Event**: There are several entries where powershell.exe is executed with a command line that includes searching for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. This might indicate data harvesting or credential extraction attempts because the script is looking for sensitive information in files.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat File Creation**: Winlogbeat.exe created a new configuration file. That's normal if it's being set up, but I need to consider if this could be part of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Notepad Registry Edit**: Notepad was used to set a registry value. While not impossible for legitimate use, scripts or malware can also modify the registry.\n\n4. **Process Access and Image Load Events**: Multiple instances where processes access other images or files, such as urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll. These are standard system files, but repeated accesses by different processes might warrant attention.\n\n5. **svchost.exe Registry Changes**: svchost is a legitimate process, but multiple registry writes could indicate malicious activity trying to hide itself.\n\n6. **Calculator.exe Activities**: Calculator.exe accessing urlmon.dll and setting registry values seems unusual. Typically, it's not expected for such benign processes to perform these actions, which might suggest either persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.\n\n7. **Conhost.exe and Other Host Processes**: These are often used by legitimate applications but can be exploited by malware.\n\n8. **Chrome Events**: Pipe creation and registry writes by chrome.exe could be part of normal operation, especially if extensions are involved, but it's worth checking if these activities are out of the ordinary.\n\nNow, considering all events together:\n\n- The repeated use of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines stands out as potentially malicious.\n- Multiple processes (powershell, findstr, notepad) modifying registry and file system could be part of persistence or privilege escalation.\n- Calculator.exe's actions are particularly concerning because it's a common default app that wouldn't typically perform such operations.\n\nThe combination suggests possible unauthorized access, credential harvesting, or installation of malware. The confidence level is high due to the repeated suspicious activities across different processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious powershell.exe commands searching for sensitive data and other unusual process activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL events, each with process info, windows log task, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from 'chrome.exe' performing various tasks like setting registry values, DNS queries, image loads, and network connections. These seem pretty standard for Chrome as it's a common browser that interacts with system resources. The repetitive RegistryEvent tasks might be normal since browsers often tweak settings or extensions.\n\nThere's also an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file, which I think is related to log management software, so that's probably benign. Then there's a 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, but the filename doesn't raise any immediate red flags. It could be part of normal scripting or user activity.\n\nLooking at the network connections from Chrome again, while unusual activity here might indicate something fishy, in this case, it's just standard browsing behavior like DNS lookups and connections, which are typical. There's a DnsQuery from 'process' None as well, but since it's not tied to any malicious process, that doesn't add concern.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior here. The events don't show signs of known attack patterns or unusual combinations. So, I think this batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal user activities such as Chrome browser operations, DNS queries, and file creations from legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe are creating files. Specifically, powershell.exe is creating estrutura_ativo.txt in the user's Downloads directory. That might be normal if it's part of a script or legitimate activity, but I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several events involving schtasks.exe deleting scheduled tasks. The command lines show that tasks like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and others are being deleted. This could be normal maintenance, but it's also a common tactic for malware to remove competing threats or cover its tracks.\n\nI notice multiple instances where svchost.exe is modifying the registry. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, but unusual activity here could indicate malicious behavior, like creating new services or disabling security features.\n\nThe use of cmd.exe with specific commands to delete scheduled tasks and set registry values stands out too. While command prompt is commonly used for administrative tasks, automated scripts deleting multiple tasks might be part of a larger campaign.\n\nThere are also Process Create events for whoami.exe and conhost.exe. Whoami is often used to check user permissions, which could be part of privilege escalation, but it's hard to tell without more context. Conhost.exe is typically related to console windows; its use here might not be malicious on its own, but combined with other activities, it's worth noting.\n\nThe high frequency of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry is concerning. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The repeated ProcessAccess tasks could indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at all these events together, there are several red flags:\n1. Multiple deletions of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe.\n2. Registry modifications by svchost.exe and cmd.exe.\n3. Extensive PowerShell activity with file creation, process access, and registry changes.\n4. Use of command-line tools to delete tasks and modify system settings.\n\nWhile each event on its own might not be alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The batch shows a pattern that could indicate an attacker trying to clean up traces, disable security mechanisms, or establish persistence. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as Powershell executing commands, deletion of scheduled tasks, and registry modifications, which could be signs of an attack or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what's happening here.\n\nFirst, I notice several cmd.exe processes being created with command lines that execute other commands. For example, the first event shows cmd.exe running \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That looks like it's trying to delete Notepad processes. Then there are similar events using net.exe and net1.exe to delete user accounts. These commands seem a bit suspicious because they're administrative actions that could be part of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used for malicious activities because it's powerful and can do many things. The events show it accessing registry values and other processes, which might indicate script execution or lateral movement within the system.\n\nThere are also instances where WMIC.exe is involved. WMIC is another tool often used by attackers for command execution and process management. The fact that it's loading various DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll could be an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms or execute malicious code.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, I see events related to Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, and Process accessed. These are all indicators of potentially malicious activities because attackers often need to create processes, modify registry settings, load specific modules, and access other processes to carry out their objectives.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple attempts to delete user accounts using net.exe and cmd.exe commands. This could be an attempt to remove traces or escalate privileges by deleting administrative accounts, which would make it harder for defenders to track the attack.\n\nThe use of conhost.exe is another red flag. Conhost is often used in command-line attacks as a host process, and seeing it alongside other suspicious activities strengthens the case that something malicious is happening.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a clear pattern of system manipulation using multiple tools and techniques. The combination of deleting processes, accessing registry values, loading specific DLLs, and attempting to delete user accounts suggests a coordinated attack rather than random or legitimate activity.\n\nMoreover, the repeated use of different command-line tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe, net.exe) indicates that the attacker is trying to stay under the radar by using various methods to execute commands. This diversity in tactics makes it harder for standard security measures to detect and block them.\n\nThe confidence level here is pretty high because each individual event could be considered suspicious, but when taken together, they form a coherent narrative of malicious behavior. The fact that multiple indicators across different categories (process creation, registry modifications, image loading) are present further solidifies the conclusion that this batch is indeed interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of process creation and deletion attempts, including use of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe with suspicious command lines.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is either 'powershell.exe' or other command-line tools like 'cmd.exe', 'net.exe', and 'whoami.exe'. The tasks being logged include things like Process Create, Registry value set, and User Account Management. \n\nI notice a pattern of processes accessing system components: 'powershell.exe' accessing the registry and creating processes, 'cmd.exe' deleting users in the domain with commands like '\/del \/domain'. Also, there are attempts to delete services using 'sc delete', which is unusual activity. The use of net.exe and sc.exe for user deletions and service removals stands out as potential indicators of malicious behavior.\n\nMoreover, multiple entries show Registry modifications across different processes, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. The consistent use of these tools to modify system settings suggests a possible attack rather than normal user activity.\n\nGiven all these signs—process creations for potentially harmful commands, registry manipulations, and repeated attempts to delete users and services—I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting as it shows several red flags indicative of a potential cyberattack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation and registry modifications using tools like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, and sc.exe.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an execution of 'whoami.exe' which is pretty common and usually not malicious on its own. Then, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or used. Powershell can be both legitimate for scripting and administrative tasks but is also frequently abused in attacks because it has powerful features. The events show powershell accessing the registry, which could be setting up persistence mechanisms or modifying system configurations.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process deleting files in the Temp directory. This might seem innocuous, but if these files are being deleted without proper authorization, it could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt normal operations. The file paths mentioned include .exe and .txt files, which raises suspicion as they might be temporary files created by malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, I notice multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events for powershell.exe. These are related to how PowerShell initializes and manages its runtime environment. While these can occur during normal operation, repeated or unusual instances might suggest something more nefarious, like script injection or the use of obfuscated commands to hide malicious activity.\n\nThe command line arguments for some processes include 'powershell.exe & {}', which is a bit odd. This syntax doesn't look like standard PowerShell usage and could be an attempt to run powershell in a way that's not easily detectable by simple monitoring tools. It might be part of a script or payload trying to hide its execution.\n\nThere are also instances where powershell.exe loads various .dll files, which is normal for scripting environments but could indicate the loading of malicious libraries if those files aren't legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not raise red flags, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. Multiple powershell executions with suspicious command lines, file deletions in Temp directory, and registry modifications could be indicators of an attack chain, possibly involving persistence mechanisms, credential dumping, or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with suspicious command lines, file deletions in the Temp directory, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event and seeing what's going on.\n\nThe first few logs show that PowerShell.exe is loading images like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. These are pretty standard for .NET processes, so nothing unusual there. Then there's an event where a file is created in the Windows Defender directory, MpOAV.dll. I know sometimes security software updates or installs files, but it's running through PowerShell, which could be suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a file creation of __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 in a temporary folder and then immediately deleting it. That seems odd because why create and delete a script file quickly? It might be trying to test if certain scripts are allowed or to erase evidence.\n\nThen there's a pipe created by PowerShell, which could be used for communication between processes. Not sure if that's bad yet. Another event shows the command line as powershell.exe & {}, which looks like an empty command. Sometimes attackers use this to execute commands without being too obvious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of registry value sets and process accesses by PowerShell. This could be normal admin activity, but repeated access might indicate something more nefarious, like trying to gather information or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe. That doesn't seem harmful; it's probably configuration for log shipping software. But then whoami.exe is being run multiple times. Using whoami in PowerShell could be part of privilege escalation attempts or just reconnaissance to see what user context they're running under.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with various operations like file creation\/deletion, registry access, and creating pipes might indicate a script trying to establish persistence or drop malicious files. The quick creation and deletion of the script file stands out as possibly trying to avoid detection. Also, using whoami.exe multiple times could be part of an attack chain.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because it shows behavior that's not typical for normal operations. However, without seeing actual malicious commands or more context on what these scripts are doing, it's hard to say definitively. My confidence is around 0.7 because there are red flags, but maybe they're just legitimate activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows unusual PowerShell activity including quick file creation\/deletion and multiple registry accesses, possibly indicating malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of process creations and accesses. For instance, 'whoami.exe' is being created multiple times. That's usually a common tool for users to check their permissions, so unless there's something unusual about how it's being used, it might not be suspicious on its own. Similarly, 'powershell.exe' is accessed several times. PowerShell can definitely be malicious if used for scripting or executing commands, but just accessing it doesn't necessarily mean it's being misused.\n\nThere are also entries like 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and others performing registry operations. Registry events can indicate configuration changes, which could be part of legitimate software operations, especially during setup or updates. Without seeing specific keys being modified, it's hard to say if this is malicious activity.\n\nI notice that some processes are loading DLLs, like 'urlmon.dll'. This might not be suspicious on its own since many applications load system DLLs for various functions. It's more concerning if it's part of a broader pattern indicating malware behavior, such asDLL injection or unauthorized file access.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and sequence, there doesn't seem to be an obvious chain of events that would raise red flags. The repeated network connections from 'chrome.exe' could be normal browsing activity. Without seeing unusual URLs or multiple failed connection attempts, it might not indicate malicious behavior.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file by 'winlogbeat.exe'. If this is related to log management software, it's likely benign. However, if the filename suggests something suspicious, like an unexpected extension or path, that could be a concern. In this case, the path seems standard for such tools.\n\nI also see multiple events from different processes accessing the registry and files without any apparent correlation. This lack of coherence makes me lean towards these being normal operational activities rather than coordinated malicious actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: individual events don't stand out as malicious on their own. The repetition is more in line with routine system usage or log noise. There's no clear pattern indicating an attack or unauthorized access across the entire batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are consistent with normal system operations, including process creations and registry modifications, without evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
