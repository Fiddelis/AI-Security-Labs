{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed. That in itself isn't necessarily suspicious because PowerShell is a common tool used by both admins and attackers. But I should keep an eye out for how it's being used.\n\nThe second event shows whoami.exe being executed without any arguments. It seems straightforward; maybe the user is checking their permissions or something. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNow, looking at more powershell.exe events: there are several instances where PowerShell is accessing files and registry values. The third event has a command line that's trying to compress some directories into a zip file in the TEMP directory. That might be a red flag because creating compressed archives can be part of malicious activities like exfiltration.\n\nI notice that after creating these zip files, there are events where the files are deleted. So someone is creating and then immediately deleting temporary PowerShell scripts. This behavior could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or delete evidence quickly.\n\nAnother thing I see is multiple calls to Compress-Archive with different paths each time. The paths seem to vary slightly but follow a pattern, which might suggest some automated process or perhaps a script trying to access various directories.\n\nThere are also several Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. This is normal for PowerShell scripts as they load necessary libraries, so probably not an issue here.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with commands that create and then delete temporary files, along with multiple compression activities, raises some eyebrows. It could be a legitimate admin task, but given the deletions after creation, there's a possibility of malicious intent like testing for file creation permissions or attempting to move data without being detected.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of these behaviors. The confidence isn't super high, maybe around 0.7, since it's possible that an admin is performing routine tasks. However, the combination of actions makes me cautious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with file creation and deletion patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is powershell.exe with command lines involving Compress-Archive. This seems like Powershell is being used to compress files into zip archives. The paths in these commands look legitimate, pointing to various directories on the system. While using Powershell for compression isn't inherently malicious, it's a common technique for attackers because of its scripting capabilities.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe is involved without command lines, just process names or other log tasks like Image loaded or Process accessed. These don't seem suspicious on their own but could be part of normal operations. However, combined with the compression commands, they might indicate a script running in the background.\n\nLooking at the file paths and modules loaded, I notice that Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive is being used. This module is standard for compression tasks in Powershell, so it's not unusual unless there's something else to suggest misuse.\n\nThere are also entries from other processes like winlogbeat.exe creating files, which makes sense if that service is running. Notepad and calc.exe accessing registry values could be part of their normal operation too. The RuntimeBroker.exe and conhost.exe activities don't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nThe events involving file creations in the TEMP directory for zip files made by Powershell are worth noting. Attackers might use such techniques to bundle malicious files or exfiltrate data. Additionally, the repeated use of Compress-Archive commands could indicate a script attempting multiple compression tasks, which might be part of data gathering or preparation for an attack.\n\nI also see that some events have file paths being created, like .winlogbeat.yml.new and the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. These seem related to configuration files, possibly from legitimate processes, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while each individual event might not be suspicious, the combination—especially multiple Powershell processes compressing files into TEMP directories—could be indicative of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or preparing for a payload delivery. The frequency and specific use of Compress-Archive in different contexts across various events increases my concern.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because there are patterns that could signal malicious behavior despite each event appearing normal on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes compressing files into zip archives in the TEMP directory may indicate potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or preparation for payload delivery.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I need to determine if the entire set is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first few entries are from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process in Windows, often used by legitimate services, but it can also be malicious because many malware use it to hide their activities. However, seeing multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry might not immediately raise red flags unless they're doing something unusual.\n\nNext, there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal since system32 files are standard. Then, winlogbeat.exe creating a file—that’s expected if it's part of log management software.\n\nLooking further, ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry values is another common process often associated with the Start menu or application windows. It's not uncommon to see such events.\n\nThere are several entries from Calculator.exe and powershell.exe accessing registries and processes. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and evil. The command line in one of the powershell.exe events isn't provided, but just accessing process information might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nChrome.exe has multiple registry writes and loading system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate actions; chrome often interacts with these components for security or functionality. The repeated registry writes could be part of normal operation, though unusual if they're frequent or accessing unexpected keys.\n\nThe whoami.exe process creating a new process is standard user info retrieval and likely not malicious unless it's used in an attack chain.\n\nConsidering the entire batch, most events are from known processes performing tasks that align with their expected behaviors. The only possible red flags might be multiple registry writes by svchost.exe or powershell.exe accessing other processes, but without more context on what exactly is being modified or accessed, it's hard to say they're malicious.\n\nHowever, the repetition of registry set events in chrome.exe and svchost.exe stands out a bit. Malware often uses these techniques for persistence or configuration changes. But since all other activities seem normal, and there's no indication of failed attempts or unusual file operations beyond what is expected, I'm leaning towards not classifying this as interesting.\n\nI think the confidence here should be medium because while some activities are notable, they don't strongly indicate malicious behavior without further context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events involve normal system processes and common activities like registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, which are not inherently suspicious. The winlogbeat.exe file creation is expected for log management. No clear indicators of malicious behavior across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
