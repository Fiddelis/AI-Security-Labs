{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The goal is to determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from different processes: cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Each event has a process name, a task type (like Registry value set, Image loaded, File created), and sometimes a file path.\n\nLooking at the tasks:\n- Several events are \"Registry value set\" by chrome.exe. I know that legitimate software often interacts with the registry, so this alone might not be suspicious.\n- Chrome is also loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those sound like standard system files, which isn't concerning.\n- svchost.exe created a file related to Windows Delivery Optimization. Svchost is known for legitimate services, so that's normal.\n- powershell.exe created two files: componente_principal.txt and elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers but can also be innocent scripts. The filenames are in Spanish, which isn't necessarily malicious, but could be a red flag depending on context.\n- winlogbeat.exe created a .yml file, which is expected if it's an agent collecting logs.\n\nI don't see any signs of direct malware indicators here. No unusual files being executed or network activities. The events seem to be normal system operations and legitimate software actions.\n\nSo, overall, while there are multiple entries that could look suspicious at first glance, nothing stands out as malicious when considering the entire batch together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes interacting with registry and file operations without signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that Chrome.exe is making DNS queries and establishing network connections. That seems normal because browsers do need to connect to servers and resolve domain names. Nothing unusual there.\n\nThen, moving further into the logs, I notice a lot of activity from PowerShell.exe. The first event shows that PowerShell set a registry value. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're often used in attacks for persistence or configuration changes, so that's something to keep an eye on.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for different DLLs when using PowerShell. That's also typical since PowerShell might load various libraries depending on what it's executing. But the fact that these are being loaded during a script execution could be suspicious if they're unexpected.\n\nI spot a File Create event followed by a File Delete event for the same file path: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1\". This pattern—creating and then deleting a temporary file—is often seen in malicious activities where attackers don't want to leave traces. It's a red flag because legitimate scripts usually don't delete their own files quickly unless there's an error, but it could also be part of cleanup.\n\nThere are several Provider Lifecycle events with command lines invoking PowerShell to start processes running batch files. The paths in the command lines look like they're navigating up directories using \"..\" which might indicate that the script is trying to access different locations or perhaps attempting to reach certain files. This behavior can be risky if those scripts are executing malicious commands.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell activity—registry changes, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and invoking batch scripts—raises concerns about potential malicious behavior. While individual actions might not be suspicious, the sequence and volume suggest a possible attack vector or unauthorized script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including registry modifications, image loads, file creation\/deletion, and command-line scripts indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where powershell.exe is starting other .bat files using Start-Process. That seems a bit unusual because typically, you wouldn't expect Powershell to spawn multiple processes like that unless it's part of some automated task or script execution. I should keep an eye out for any suspicious paths. The paths in the command lines are pointing to different locations on C:\\, but they don't look obviously malicious at first glance.\n\nNext, there's a process named ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing the Registry. That seems normal because that's part of Windows Shell and it often interacts with the Registry. Calculator.exe also does a Registry access; that's also not concerning since it's a standard app.\n\nThen, I notice multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting Registry values multiple times. Chrome sometimes accesses the Registry for various settings, so this isn't immediately suspicious unless it's doing something out of the ordinary. But in this case, it's just several normal operations.\n\nLooking further down, there are more powershell.exe instances doing different things. One starts a new process to run another .bat script, which again is similar to earlier entries. There's also a cmd.exe running a batch file. This could be part of a legitimate script execution or something else. The path in the command line seems generic.\n\nI see some events where powershell.exe loads DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. These are standard Windows components, so that doesn't raise flags. However, I should check if these DLLs are being used appropriately or if there's any indication of tampering.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be part of user profile initialization but could also be a spot for persistence mechanisms. It's something to note but not necessarily alarming on its own.\n\nOverall, many of these events involve legitimate processes like Chrome, Calculator, and system utilities accessing registries or loading DLLs. The repeated use of Powershell and cmd to execute .bat scripts might be a red flag because attackers often misuse these tools for command execution and persistence. However, without specific indicators of compromise (like known malicious file hashes, unusual registry keys, or network activity), it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the actions could be part of normal system operations, especially if there are scripts running in the background or legitimate automated processes. But I'm a bit uncertain because Powershell and cmd are commonly exploited tools, so any batch script execution could potentially hide malicious activities. Without more context or specific anomalies, it's safer to classify this as not interesting unless further evidence suggests otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include legitimate system processes and normal Registry interactions. While some activity with Powershell and cmd.exe could be suspicious, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior in the provided logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}\n```"}
