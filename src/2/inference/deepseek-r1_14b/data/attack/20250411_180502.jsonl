{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. So first, I'll go through each event one by one and try to spot any patterns or red flags.\n\nStarting with the first few events: all are from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome is a common browser that does make network requests and DNS lookups regularly. No immediate issues here, but I'll keep an eye out if there's something unusual in the frequency or destination of these connections.\n\nNext, I notice events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate administration tasks, but it can also be abused by attackers. The first event shows a registry value being set. That could be part of legitimate scripting, but it might also indicate malicious activity trying to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nLooking further, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with a command line that starts another process executing a .bat file. This is a bit concerning because invoking other scripts or processes can hide malicious activities. The command lines in these events are obfuscated with escaped quotes and paths that might be trying to avoid easy detection.\n\nThen, there's a series of image load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. Again, this is somewhat normal, but the specific DLLs loaded can indicate if something suspicious is happening. For example, mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll are related to .NET runtime, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other actions could be part of malicious code execution.\n\nThere's also a file creation event for a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1) followed immediately by its deletion. This behavior is a bit unusual because creating and then deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms. It might be part of testing script policies, but it's worth investigating why the file was created only to be deleted right after.\n\nAnother set of events shows multiple Provider Lifecycle tasks from powershell.exe with different command lines starting various .bat files. These batch files are located in different paths, and their names like \"unidade_principal_script.bat\" or \"modulo_logico_script.bat\" seem generic but could be obfuscating malicious scripts. The fact that multiple such processes are created adds to the suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe is being used to execute other scripts (bat files), which might contain malicious commands. The creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts could be an attempt to run arbitrary code without leaving a trace, or perhaps trying to bypass certain security policies. Additionally, the repeated use of Powershell with different command lines suggests automated or script-driven activity, which is often indicative of attacks.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be legitimate (like system administration tasks), the combination—especially the file creation\/deletion and multiple process creations with obfuscated paths—raises red flags. Therefore, this batch shows signs that might warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show powershell.exe executing multiple .bat files through Start-Process and creating\/deleting a temporary PowerShell script file, indicating potentially malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of system log events. The first thing that catches my attention is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines starting processes for various script files. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts, so multiple instances might indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several entries where chrome.exe is accessing registry values repeatedly. While Chrome can interact with the registry normally, multiple such events without a clear reason could be suspicious, possibly indicating tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nI also notice cmd.exe being used to run batch files. This is another red flag because command-line tools are often exploited by attackers for executing malicious scripts. The presence of these suggests possible script execution and persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the file paths in the powershell events, they point to different locations like C:\\objeto_padrao\\tarefa_ativo\\.. etc. These paths don't seem standard and could be temporary storage areas for malicious scripts or tools.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where processes load specific DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While some of these might be legitimate, the combination with other events makes me cautious. Malware often injects into processes or loads specific modules to hide its activities.\n\nRegistry accesses across multiple processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe) are another point of concern. Attackers frequently use registry modifications for persistence and to ensure their malicious activities survive system reboots.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a pattern of script execution using powershell and cmd, repeated registry interactions, and loading of specific modules. These indicators collectively suggest potential malicious behavior that could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts, command-line processes for batch files, and repeated registry accesses across different processes indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where different processes are setting registry values. For example, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and chrome.exe all have tasks labeled as \"Registry value set\". That seems a bit unusual because regular applications don't often modify the registry unless they're installing something or making configuration changes. But seeing this across several processes might indicate some suspicious activity.\n\nThen there's an event from Chrome where it loaded two different files: amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those sound like legitimate Windows files, so that might not be too concerning on its own. However, the fact that Chrome is involved in multiple registry modifications could still raise flags.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances of svchost.exe creating a file in the NetworkService's AppData directory. Svchost is often used by malware because it's a common process name for services, so this might be something to look into. The filename 'keyValueLKG.dat' isn't familiar to me, so that's a point of interest.\n\nThere are two powershell.exe events creating files in the user's Downloads folder. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. Creating files could be part of malicious activities like dropping payloads or storing configuration data.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe created a .yml file, which makes sense if it's related to log management software. However, since this is in the user's Downloads folder, it might be something unusual depending on how the system is set up.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes making registry changes, powershell and svchost activities, and files being created in non-standard locations. These are red flags that could indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications by different processes, including suspicious activity from powershell.exe and svchost.exe creating files in user directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
