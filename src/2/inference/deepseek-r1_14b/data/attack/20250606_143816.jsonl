{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is a process access on powershell.exe. Not unusual, but powershell can be used maliciously, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run without any command-line arguments. That's a common system utility and not typically suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing the process—again, nothing too alarming on its own but worth noting if it happens multiple times.\n\nThen there's a registry value set by powershell.exe. This could be normal administration, but it's also a common activity for malware to create persistence points in the registry.\n\nThe next event stands out. It's a new process creation of powershell.exe with a command line that includes downloading a script from GitHub and executing it. That's a red flag because downloading scripts from external sources can indicate malicious activity, especially if it's using known repositories linked to malware (in this case, 'WinPwn' which I recall is associated with malicious scripts).\n\nLooking further, there are several image load events for powershell.exe, loading various .NET framework components. While these are legitimate DLLs, the fact that they're being loaded in the context of a script execution from an external source could be concerning.\n\nThere's also a file creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script. The creation-deletion pattern is often used by attackers to clean up their tracks after executing malicious scripts.\n\nOther events include pipe creation and more registry writes, which again could be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n\nFinally, there's a process for sppsvc.exe accessing taskschd.dll, which is related to task scheduling. That's usually benign but worth monitoring if it occurs alongside other suspicious activities.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell instances, execution of external scripts, registry modifications, temporary file creation\/deletion, and persistence mechanisms like pipes—all point towards potential malicious behavior. While individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests a possible attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious activities including downloading scripts from external sources, registry modifications, and temporary file operations suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. There are a bunch of events logged from different processes, mainly involving powershell.exe and some other system utilities like svchost.exe and whoami.exe. The user wants me to analyze this batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any anomalies or red flags.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because svchost is a common system process that often interacts with the registry. Next, sppsvc.exe creates a file in the cache directory; again, this looks routine as it's part of software protection services.\n\nThen there are multiple events from powershell.exe. It accesses processes and files, which by itself isn't suspicious since PowerShell is widely used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, the command line in one event catches my eye: \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". Breaking this down, it's creating a new PS Drive mapped to \\Target\\C$. The use of \"unidade_auxiliar\" seems off—it doesn't look like standard PowerShell syntax. This might be an attempt to create a drive to access another system, possibly indicating lateral movement in a network.\n\nAnother event shows the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file. Creating and then deleting scripts can be a tactic used by attackers to avoid detection since the malicious code isn't left behind on disk. Additionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs when running powershell.exe. While this is normal during script execution, combined with other actions might raise suspicion.\n\nWhoami.exe being executed without any unusual command line arguments doesn't seem concerning on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated use of PowerShell, especially with custom scripts and potential network drive mappings, along with file creation\/deletion in temp directories, could indicate malicious activity. These actions don't definitively prove an attack but do suggest behavior that merits closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving powershell.exe performing potentially suspicious activities such as creating a new PS drive, accessing files, and setting registry values.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by understanding each event.\n\nFirst, there are several events where the process is powershell.exe executing a command line that downloads and runs a script from a GitHub repository. The script path is 'https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\/WinPwn.ps1'. I remember that S3cur3Th1sSh1t is known for malicious activities, so this script might be harmful.\n\nThe task in the winlog varies between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These tasks are part of Windows event logging and usually relate to service or driver events. But when paired with powershell.exe executing scripts, especially from external sources, it raises flags.\n\nI notice that there are multiple instances where the same command is run. Seven events have the download script, and another seven have a different command involving creating a new drive (New-PSDrive). The second command seems to be attempting to map a network drive or access remote files, which could indicate lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThe fact that these commands are repeated multiple times suggests persistence attempts or part of a larger campaign. The use of powershell.exe is common in attacks because it's built-in and can execute scripts directly, making it hard to detect sometimes.\n\nConsidering all events together, the combination of downloading malicious scripts and creating network drives points towards potential exploitation or attack activity. There's also the possibility that these are part of an automated tool like WinPwn, which is used for persistence and privilege escalation in Windows environments.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows signs of malicious behavior because it combines known indicators with repeated attempts to execute potentially harmful scripts. The repetition might indicate a failed attempt being retried or part of a multi-step attack process.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs are indeed interesting from a security standpoint as they likely indicate an active threat.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Process and Command Line:**\n   - The `process` field shows `powershell.exe`, which is often used for executing scripts in Windows.\n   - The `command_line` contains two types of commands:\n     a. Downloading and running a script from a GitHub repository (`https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn...`).\n     b. Using `New-PSDrive` to create a new drive, potentially accessing remote files.\n\n2. **Analyze the Script Source:**\n   - The script is hosted on GitHub under the user S3cur3Th1sSh1t, known for malicious activities.\n   - WinPwn scripts are associated with cyberattacks and can enable persistence and privilege escalation.\n\n3. **Examine Event Repetition:**\n   - Multiple events (7 each) indicate repeated attempts to execute these commands, suggesting possible automation or retry logic in an attack.\n\n4. **Assess Task Types in winlog:**\n   - Tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' relate to system services. Combined with powershell.exe, they may hide malicious activities.\n   \n5. **Determine Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - Use of known malicious scripts from a suspicious source.\n   - Repeated attempts to execute potentially harmful commands.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The logs indicate likely malicious activity, such as persistence or attack preparation, warranting further investigation and response measures.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of logs is determined to be **interesting**, indicating potential malicious activity. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"interesting\",\n  \"reason\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe executing potentially harmful scripts and commands, suggesting malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. The user has provided a batch of JSONL events and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it mentions \"powershell.exe\" with a command line that includes creating a new PowerShell drive pointing to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". That immediately raises a red flag because using powershell.exe can be common in malicious activities, especially when combined with remote paths. The use of New-PSDrive suggests they're trying to access another system's file system.\n\nThen, the next 17 events all have \"Execute a Remote Command\" in their winlog task. This repetition is concerning. It could indicate an attempt to execute multiple commands remotely, possibly part of a script or automated process. The fact that each event is similar might mean it's part of a loop or batch execution.\n\nConsidering the context, these actions can be signs of potential malicious activity. Creating a remote drive and executing commands on another system without proper authorization could be indicative of an attack, like lateral movement in a network. But I should also think if this could be legitimate, maybe a backup script or admin tool running checks. However, combined with the PowerShell command, it's more likely suspicious.\n\nI need to assess the confidence level. The first event is specific and potentially malicious, while the others are repetitive but not individually conclusive. There's a pattern that suggests an attack, so my confidence is high but not certain. Maybe around 0.8 or 0.9?\n\nSo, I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows signs of potential unauthorized remote access and repeated command execution, which should be investigated.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating repeated attempts to execute remote commands, potentially indicative of malicious activity such as lateral movement or unauthorized system access. The initial event shows a PowerShell command attempting to create a new drive mapping to a remote target, while subsequent events show continued remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
