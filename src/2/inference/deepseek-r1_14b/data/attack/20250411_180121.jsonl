First, I notice that most of the initial logs are from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal, especially for a browser, so probably not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen, there's a shift to powershell.exe activity. The command lines show that PowerShell is downloading files from various GitHub repositories into temporary locations. This caught my attention because using PowerShell to download files from remote sources can be common but also a red flag if the sites are suspicious or known malicious domains. \n\nLooking deeper, each of these events uses DownloadFile from System.Net.WebClient to fetch LICENSE.txt files from different branches under various project names like 'modulo_temporario', 'unidade_base', etc., saving them as temporary files such as entrada_comum.txt and unidade_ativo.txt. While LICENSE files are usually benign, the repeated downloads from different repositories might indicate testing or deployment of malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there's a script policy test file being created and then deleted shortly after. This could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies by testing their effectiveness before executing more harmful code. The fact that multiple such events occur suggests a pattern rather than isolated incidents, which raises the suspicion level.\n\nThe combination of these activities—downloading files from external sources, temporary script creation\/deletion, and repeated similar patterns—points towards potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few entries show powershell.exe processes with command lines that download files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files under different branches and modules. This is a bit concerning because downloading files using PowerShell can be a common tactic in malicious activities, like downloading malware or scripts. However, sometimes legitimate scripts also use similar methods, so I need more context.\n\nNext, there are several entries where chrome.exe sets registry values multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, repeated writes could indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not typical user actions. But without knowing the exact changes made, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThen, I notice a series of Registry value set events from various processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and others. These could be normal operations, but repeated writes might warrant closer look.\n\nThere are also some DNS query events and file creation events related to the winlogbeat.exe tool, which is likely part of log management. The paths seem legitimate, so this might not be an issue unless there's something unusual about how it's being used.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, the powershell.exe activities stand out because they involve downloading files from external sources. These could potentially be malicious scripts or indicators of compromise. Additionally, the repeated registry modifications and file creations across different processes might suggest some form of persistence or configuration changes that are worth investigating.\n\nHowever, some events might just be normal system activity. For example, powershell.exe is a common tool, and Chrome setting registry values is part of its operation. The winlogbeat.exe entries seem related to log management, which wouldn't raise red flags on their own.\n\nConsidering the combination of these activities—downloading files via PowerShell, multiple registry changes, and repeated file creations—it's plausible that this could be malicious behavior. While not all events are suspicious on their own, together they create a pattern that might indicate an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the powershell downloads and the unusual number of registry modifications are concerning. The confidence isn't too high (maybe around 60%) without more detailed information, but there's enough here to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits a combination of activities that collectively raise suspicions of potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system access.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of system logs to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. I'll go through each event and look for patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few events, there are multiple instances where `svchost.exe` is modifying registry values. That's a bit concerning because svchost is commonly used by malware since it's part of legitimate system processes but can be abused. The fact that these are repeated makes me think someone might be trying to hide their tracks or establish persistence.\n\nNext, I notice `powershell.exe` being accessed several times with different events like process access and registry modifications. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. Frequent accesses without clear legitimate reasons could indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe processes: `\/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F`. This seems like an attempt to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting tasks they've created to avoid detection. The fact that this is done with output redirected to null suggests it's part of a script trying not to leave traces.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event uses `REG DELETE` targeting the Run key under HKCU, specifically removing an entry named \"modulo_temporario\". This looks like another attempt to remove something from the startup registry to prevent it from running on next boot. Again, this is a common tactic in malware to erase evidence of their presence.\n\nThere's also a process where `schtasks.exe` is run with similar deletion commands, which reinforces the idea that tasks are being removed. Additionally, `reg.exe` is used for more registry modifications, likely trying to cover all bases by deleting keys and values related to persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe repeated use of `whoami.exe` could be part of information gathering, perhaps checking user privileges or system details before executing further actions. While standalone it's not necessarily malicious, the combination with other activities makes me suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple processes (svchost.exe, powershell.exe) being used for registry modifications and deletions; attempts to remove scheduled tasks and registry entries related to startup programs—these are classic signs of a potential malware or APT attack trying to cover their tracks. The repetitive nature of these events over several logs suggests a prolonged session where an attacker is methodically trying to erase evidence.\n\nHowever, it's possible that this could also be part of legitimate system cleanup processes or automated scripts, but given the combination and specific commands used (like deleting specific task names and registry entries), the malicious angle seems more likely. To confirm, I'd recommend deeper analysis, perhaps checking for known indicators in the timestamps and event IDs, as well as looking into network traffic to see if any data was exfiltrated or commands received from external sources.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Repeated Process Activities:**\n   - `svchost.exe` frequently accessing\/modify registry values (lines 2,5, etc.) – suspicious as it's often used by malware.\n   \n2. **Note PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` being accessed without clear legitimate use, a red flag for potential malicious scripts.\n\n3. **Examine Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks (e.g., `\/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn`) – attackers often remove traces of their activities.\n   \n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Use of `REG DELETE` targeting startup entries in HKCU suggests attempts to erase persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\n5. **Combine Observations:**\n   - The pattern of registry edits, task deletions, and PowerShell usage points towards potential malicious activity aiming to cover tracks.\n\n6. **Assess Likelihood of Malware:**\n   - Given the nature and combination of these activities, it's highly indicative of an attack, possibly involving APTs or malware attempting system persistence and cleanup.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe logs indicate potential malicious activity, with signs of attackers attempting to delete traces and establish persistence. It is highly likely that this batch is interesting for further investigation due to the suspicious patterns observed."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, including executing commands and scripts that can be part of an attack chain. So I need to assess whether these actions are typical or potentially suspicious.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field, there are several types: Process accessed, Provider Lifecycle, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, and Engine Lifecycle. The combination here is notable because it shows multiple interactions with system components, which could be part of a script's execution or malicious activity.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe accessing something via 'ProcessAccess'. Then there are several events where the command line is 'powershell.exe & {}', which looks like PowerShell being called without any arguments. The Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks suggest that the PowerShell engine is starting up, which isn't unusual on its own but combined with other actions might be worth noting.\n\nThere's a Registry value set event, which could indicate configuration changes. Malware often modifies registry entries to persist itself or change system settings. Additionally, there are multiple Image loaded events pointing to legitimate DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. These are common and likely not malicious, but in combination with other actions, they might be part of a larger script execution.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe creates a temporary file, __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1, then deletes it immediately. This behavior is interesting because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection or to test if the system allows certain operations without user intervention. It could be part of a script's setup phase but might also be indicative of trying to run unauthorized code.\n\nThere are Pipe Created events, which allow interprocess communication. This is common for legitimate scripts but can also be used by malware to communicate with other processes or to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This might relate to PowerShell profile configuration, but again, it's something that could be part of legitimate scripting but could also hint at persistence mechanisms if modified improperly.\n\nThe events involving conhost.exe are less frequent but still present. Conhost is often associated with console windows and can sometimes be used by scripts or malware for command-line interactions.\n\nPutting all these together, while individual actions might seem benign, the repeated use of powershell.exe across various system components (registry, file creation\/deletion, pipes) raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The script appears to be performing multiple operations that could indicate testing system configurations, creating persistence points, or attempting unauthorized access.\n\nHowever, without additional context like timestamps showing rapid succession of events or specific indicators of compromise, it's challenging to definitively label this as an attack. But the pattern is non-trivial and warrants closer examination by a security professional. The user might be running a script that has legitimate purposes but could also have malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity:** The events primarily involve `powershell.exe`, a tool often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\n2. **Analyze Task Types:** Various tasks such as Registry modifications, Image loading, File creation\/deletion, and Pipe Creation suggest multiple system interactions, which could be part of malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Examine Script Execution Patterns:** The temporary file creation and deletion by `powershell.exe` might indicate testing or hiding code execution, potentially to avoid detection.\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Actions like modifying registry entries and creating files in Startup directories can be signs of persistence techniques used by malware.\n\n5. **Assess Communication Channels:** Pipe Creation events allow interprocess communication, which can be legitimate but also suspicious if part of a larger attack chain.\n\n6. **Consider Contextual Clues:** While individual actions aren't necessarily malicious, the combination and frequency raise concerns about potential exploitation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits behavior that is potentially indicative of malicious activity due to the repeated use of `powershell.exe` across multiple system components and script execution patterns. While not definitively conclusive without further context, these activities warrant a closer security review to assess for any potential threats or compromises.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe cybersecurity expert concludes that the batch of events involving powershell.exe exhibits potentially malicious behavior, particularly due to the repeated use across various system interactions and suspicious scripting patterns. Therefore, this is classified as **interesting** from a security perspective.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{Interesting}"}

My job is to analyze all these events together and determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nLooking at each event, I notice that most of them involve processes like whoami.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. The tasks associated are things like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete logged. \n\nPowershell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, so seeing multiple instances of it being executed might be concerning. Additionally, there are events where powershell.exe is setting registry values, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuring system settings in an unusual way.\n\nThe batch also shows that powershell.exe is creating and then deleting a file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1) in the user's temporary directory. This pattern—creating and immediately deleting a script file—is often used by attackers to test if their malicious scripts would be detected or blocked by antivirus software before executing them.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks under powershell.exe are unusual and could indicate some form of communication or activation mechanism that doesn't follow standard behavior. The command lines for some processes are either empty or have \"& {}\" which might be attempts to obfuscate the actual commands being executed.\n\nWhile individual events involving these tools aren't necessarily suspicious, the combination here raises red flags. Multiple powershell.exe instances with varied tasks, file operations in temp directories, and registry modifications could be signs of malicious activity like script testing, persistence setup, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nHowever, without more context, such as timestamps indicating quick succession of these events or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain.

The first few events involve processes like Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe performing tasks such as creating pipes and setting registry values. Some of these are repeated multiple times, especially with chrome.exe having several RegistryEvent entries.\n\nThen, I notice a process named 'whoami.exe' being created. That's interesting because whoami is typically used to get user information, which can be part of reconnaissance activities in attacks. It could be used by malicious actors to gather system details.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. This isn't unusual on its own but could indicate that PowerShell is executing scripts or commands, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nOne event stands out where powershell.exe is started with a command line argument: \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This command tries to delete a file in the TEMP directory. The use of Remove-Item suggests it's clearing evidence, which is a common tactic in attacks to remove logs or files that could trace back malicious activities.\n\nAlso, there are multiple RegistryEvent and ProcessAccess tasks from powershell.exe. Accessing registry keys can be part of legitimate operations but also often used by malware for persistence or configuration.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious commands, the deletion attempt, and the whoami.exe process suggest a possible attack chain. This could indicate someone trying to maintain access, gather information, or cover their tracks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch shows signs that might be indicative of malicious activity.

This caught my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, but it's also commonly used legitimately.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing different registry values and loading various image files. Some of these are related to .NET framework components, which is normal since PowerShell relies on those libraries. However, the repeated FileDeleteDetected event might be a red flag because it indicates that a file was deleted without explicit permission.\n\nI notice several instances where temporary script files are being created and then immediately deleted. This behavior could be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace of executed scripts on disk. For example, there's a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 that gets created and then deleted right after.\n\nAnother thing I'm noticing is the use of whoami.exe being run from the system32 directory. While whoami is a legitimate tool, its execution can sometimes be part of privilege escalation techniques if executed in certain contexts or combined with other actions.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe is accessing pipes and creating files in various directories, including the user's Downloads folder. The creation of an object file there might not be suspicious on its own but could be part of a larger operation.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of PowerShell to delete temporary files, create and then immediately remove script files, and access system components is concerning.

Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from 'chrome.exe' where the task is a Registry value set. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions. I don't think that's suspicious on its own, especially if it's repeated multiple times—maybe during an update or configuration change.\n\nThen, I notice events involving 'RuntimeBroker.exe', which I know is related to user accounts in Windows. It's part of the User Account Control (UAC) and usually handles elevation. If this process is writing to the registry, that could be normal activity, especially if a user is doing something that requires admin rights.\n\nNext up are multiple entries from 'powershell.exe'. The tasks here are labeled as Process accessed. PowerShell is such a versatile tool and often used both for legitimate administrative tasks and by attackers. However, just seeing it accessing processes might not be enough to raise flags unless the specific commands or actions are malicious.\n\nThere are also several instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed with its command line path. Whoami is commonly used to determine user information, which in itself isn't suspicious. It's a standard utility and could be part of scripts checking user permissions or debugging.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe', which I recognize as part of the Elastic Stack for log management. It created a file related to its configuration. That seems benign; it's just setting up its data files.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate task by powershell.exe pointing to 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename is in Portuguese, which translates to \"active package.\" Without knowing more about the context, this could be part of some script or legitimate process. However, the fact that it's created by PowerShell might raise an eyebrow since attackers often use PS scripts for malicious activities.\n\nPutting all these together: a lot of normal processes like Chrome, RuntimeBroker, whoami, and winlogbeat are present. The multiple PowerShell accesses stand out, but without additional indicators like unusual commands or access patterns, they could still be legitimate admin tasks. However, the creation of 'pacote_ativo.txt' by PowerShell adds some weight to considering this batch as potentially suspicious. It's a combination that might indicate script execution or lateral movement.\n\nI'm leaning towards INTERESTING because while many events are normal, the presence of several PowerShell accesses and the file creation could be signs of malicious activity or at least warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and creating files, which may indicate potential malicious activity.
