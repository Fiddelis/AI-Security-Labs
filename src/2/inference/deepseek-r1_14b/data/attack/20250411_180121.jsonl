Let's see what each event shows.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where different processes like conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe are being executed. These commands seem pretty standard but might be part of malicious activities if used in a certain way.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes: Process Create is common when new applications start. Registry events—like value sets or deletions—are normal for configuration changes but could indicate tampering, especially if they're modifying known registry keys related to startup programs.\n\nI notice cmd.exe and reg.exe being used to delete entries in HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This key typically holds information about applications that run at startup. Deleting or modifying these might be an attempt to remove traces of previously executed malicious software or to prevent certain programs from running automatically.\n\nThere are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessed, sometimes with command lines like \"& {}\". That seems odd because it's just a placeholder. Malware often uses PowerShell for tasks like this because it can execute scripts and commands with system-level permissions.\n\nAlso, some events show provider lifecycle tasks related to PowerShell, which could be part of how the script initializes or terminates. Repeated Process Create and Access events for powershell.exe might suggest that it's being invoked multiple times, possibly as part of a larger script or loop.\n\nPutting it all together: deleting entries from the Run key, using PowerShell with unusual command lines, repeated process creations, and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each line is a separate event with some process information, Windows log data, and sometimes file details. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLet me go through each event one by one. \n\nThe first few events are from chrome.exe with network connections. That's normal because Chrome does make lots of DNS queries and connects to websites. So nothing suspicious there. Then, I see powershell.exe events starting around the 7th line. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the powershell.exe processes: it's using WebClient to download a file from GitHub. The URL points to \"modulo_padrao.txt\" under a repository named \"objeto_base\". I'm not familiar with that repository, but automated downloads can be part of script execution. \n\nThere are multiple events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading various image files. That's common for script execution too, as scripts often interact with the system. However, the fact that there are multiple file creations and deletions in the Temp directory is a red flag. Specifically, creating a script named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" and then deleting it shortly after could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if scripts are allowed.\n\nAlso, I notice several different GitHub URLs being downloaded into temp files with varying names like \"entrada_comum.txt\", \"unidade_ativo.txt\", and \"tarefa_auxiliar.txt\". Each of these is a new file in the Temp directory. The fact that multiple such downloads occur from different repositories suggests automated activity or possibly script-based downloading.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like there's some malicious script execution happening using PowerShell to download files from GitHub. The repeated attempts with various filenames and URLs, along with the registry access and process activities, make me think this could be part of a larger attack or data exfiltration.\n\nSo overall, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because there are multiple signs of potentially malicious activity involving script execution and file downloads from suspicious sources.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activities using PowerShell to download files from GitHub, including suspicious file operations in the Temp directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events and figure out if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub. Each time, it's using the DownloadFile method to get a LICENSE.txt file into the TEMP directory under different names like tarefa_geral.txt and estrutura_temporario.txt. This is a bit concerning because PowerShell scripts often are used for malicious purposes due to their scripting capabilities and how they can execute commands.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the User's Downloads folder named elemento_padrao.txt. While downloading files isn't inherently bad, combining it with the other events where multiple files are being downloaded might raise flags.\n\nThen, looking at the 'winlog' field, several entries mention tasks related to Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle for powershell.exe. These types of logs often indicate process creation or termination, which in itself isn't malicious but could be part of a larger sequence of events.\n\nI also see multiple instances where chrome.exe is modifying registry values through RegistryEvent tasks. While Chrome does make changes to the registry during normal operation, a high number of such events without context might warrant closer inspection to ensure they're legitimate.\n\nThere's an event where conhost.exe interacts with the registry, and another involving winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. These could be related to log management or other system processes, but again, in isolation, they might not seem suspicious unless they're part of an unusual pattern.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe and the associated downloading of files from various GitHub repositories. Each download event uses a slightly different repository path, which could indicate testing or multiple attempts to fetch resources. Additionally, the fact that each file is saved under a different name in the TEMP directory might be an attempt to avoid detection by using varying filenames.\n\nThe presence of multiple process creations and file operations without corresponding events that would explain their purpose (like user interaction or legitimate script execution) adds to the suspicion. It's possible that these activities are part of a broader attack vector, such as downloading malicious scripts or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is the consistency in the tasks associated with powershell.exe, like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, which could be normal for PowerShell use but combined with the file downloads might indicate command execution or script loading.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created by powershell.exe in the StartupProfileData directory. This location isn't typically where user scripts are stored, and having a file here without known reason could be a sign of persistence, meaning the malicious code could run on subsequent system restarts.\n\nThe high number of registry modifications from chrome.exe is another area to consider. While Chrome does perform many registry operations during normal use (e.g., extension installations, settings changes), an unusual spike or specific patterns might indicate tampering, especially if it's done in a way that's not consistent with usual user behavior.\n\nTaking all these factors together, the combination of multiple file downloads from external sources using powershell.exe, coupled with registry modifications across different processes, suggests potential malicious activity. The events don't provide clear evidence of harm but create a concerning pattern that merits investigation to rule out threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub and creating temporary files, along with significant registry modifications across different processes, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is running. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. I also notice that some of these powershell.exe events have tasks like 'Registry value set' or 'Process accessed.' These actions can be indicators of unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother thing I see is cmd.exe being used with command lines that involve SCHTASKS and other commands. For example, one event shows \"cmd.exe \/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1.\" This looks suspicious because deleting a scheduled task named 'spawn' might be an attempt to remove persistence. Malware often schedules tasks to run at startup, so removing them could be part of covering tracks or trying to stop further execution.\n\nThere's also SCHTASKS.exe being executed with similar commands. The process create event for schtasks.exe and the image load from taskschd.dll might indicate that someone is manipulating scheduled tasks, which is another common tactic in attacks to maintain persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where svchost.exe is modifying registry values. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be used maliciously by replacing it with a counterfeit service. The repeated registry changes could be part of setting up or removing malicious services or keys.\n\nNotepad and Calculator are innocent enough on their own, but sometimes attackers use them to open files or execute commands, so I need to check if there's anything unusual in their events. In this case, notepad.exe accessing the registry might be normal for certain operations, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe is another process that's typically part of Windows services, but seeing it set registry values could be a sign of something amiss, though not necessarily malicious. Still, combined with other activities, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe whoami.exe process running without any output redirection might just be a user checking their permissions, but again, in context with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nLooking at file operations, I see powershell.exe creating files or accessing them, and winlogbeat is updating its configuration files. There's also an 'entrada_base.txt' being created, which could be part of data exfiltration or storing malicious scripts.\n\nThe network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe is interesting because that's a legitimate process for antivirus\/antimalware software. If it detects a connection, maybe there was some attempt to communicate over the network, which could indicate data being sent out or receiving commands.\n\nImage loads like urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll are part of normal Windows operations, but seeing them loaded by multiple processes might suggest they're being exploited or used in a way that's not standard.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: powershell.exe with suspicious task actions, cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks, schtasks.exe manipulation, and svchost.exe registry modifications. These activities collectively point towards potential malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence, data collection, or lateral movement within the system.\n\nWhile some of these events could be legitimate (like a user running PowerShell for administrative tasks), the volume and combination suggest they might not be normal. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe process accesses, cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks, schtasks.exe manipulation, and svchost.exe registry modifications indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few cmd.exe and conhost.exe processes setting registry values. That might be normal admin activity, but it could also be part of malicious behavior. Not sure yet.\n\nThen I notice multiple powershell.exe entries. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks. The events show that PowerShell accessed processes, created new instances, and loaded various images like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are standard .NET components, so that's expected. But the fact that they're being accessed repeatedly might be a red flag.\n\nThere are also events where PowerShell creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. This seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script could indicate an attempt to bypass file persistence detection, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from PowerShell instances. I'm not entirely sure what that signifies, but it might relate to event subscription or provider registration, which could be part of setting up malicious activities.\n\nThe last few events involve ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry and other processes doing similar things. It's hard to say if these are related without more context, but combined with the PowerShell activity, they might contribute to a concerning pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing, accessing system files, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, and repeated Registry modifications across different processes. This combination could indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell for command execution, persistence, or lateral movement within the system. The fact that there's both file creation and deletion of a script suggests possible scripting to evade detection.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern doesn't look like normal user activity, especially with the temporary script handling and multiple process creations\/accesses. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context or indicators of compromise.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve PowerShell executions. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities due to its built-in capabilities and widespread presence on Windows systems. The repeated occurrence of 'powershell.exe' in the process name stands out.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are several ImageLoad events where specific DLL files are being loaded. These includeclr.dll, mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and mscorlib.ni.dll. PowerShell relies on these .NET framework components, so this isn't unusual on its own. However, combined with other activities, it could be part of malicious scripting.\n\nI see a FileCreate event for a temporary file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 in the user's Temp directory. This is suspicious because creating a new PowerShell script in a temporary folder can be a sign of script execution, which might be used to test or execute malicious code. The fact that this file is created and then deleted quickly (FileDeleteDetected) adds more concern—malware often deletes traces of its activity.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events from PowerShell, which could indicate communication with other processes or external commands. Pipes can be a method for attackers to maintain persistence or control.\n\nAnother notable event is the creation of a file in the Windows PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This location is used for profile data when PowerShell runs non-interactively. Malware might use this to execute scripts at startup, making it another point of concern.\n\nRegistry value set events from both PowerShell and conhost.exe are present. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to hide traces. This activity could indicate an attempt to maintain access across reboots.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe execution, which is commonly used by attackers to gather information about the system or user context. It's not inherently malicious but combined with other activities might suggest reconnaissance.\n\ncmd.exe executions and registry interactions further the suspicion. cmd is another tool often abused for command execution and script spawning. The combination of these tools' usage across different log entries creates a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a sequence of actions typical in an attack chain: script creation\/deletion, process creation, registry modifications, and system information gathering. While individually some activities are benign, the volume and combination point towards something potentially malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell executions, file creations\/deletions in temp directory, registry modifications, and potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The tasks include creating pipes, accessing processes, and setting registry values. These actions alone aren't suspicious, but repeated attempts might raise flags.\n\nI notice that chrome.exe is also involved in several Registry value set events. While legitimate software can modify the registry, multiple such events from the same process could indicate something's off. Additionally, the presence of conhost.exe interacting with the registry adds another layer to consider since it's often used by scripts or malicious processes to hide their activity.\n\nThere's an interesting entry where whoami.exe was executed. This command is typically used to check user information and permissions. If this happens in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could be a sign of privilege escalation or information gathering by malware.\n\nA notable event is the powershell.exe process that runs a command line with a script attempting to remove a .zip file from the TEMP directory. This might suggest an attempt to clean up evidence or delete malicious files, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the file events, there are ImageLoad and FileCreate tasks for various DLLs and profile data. These could be legitimate operations, but the combination with other activities makes them worth monitoring.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions might not be suspicious on their own, the volume of powershell.exe activity, including registry modifications, process access, and script execution, along with attempts to delete files and check user information, raises concern.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell and Chrome activities. The first few entries show that powershell.exe is loading various .NET framework DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These seem normal because PowerShell relies on these libraries to function. I don't see any immediate red flags here.\n\nThen there's an event where a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 is created and then deleted in the TEMP directory. This could be part of some script testing or policy checking, which isn't unusual. Sometimes scripts create temporary files to test permissions or configurations.\n\nNext, there are several events where PowerShell is used with Remove-Item commands targeting .zip files in the TEMP directory. The paths being removed vary but follow a pattern like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. This looks like an attempt to clean up or remove specific files from the system. While it's not inherently malicious, such behavior could be part of legitimate script execution, but it might also indicate some automated cleanup after potentially malicious activities.\n\nThe events involving chrome.exe are mostly about loading DLLs and registry changes. These don't seem suspicious on their own. However, one event shows a registry value being set, which could be normal operation or part of malicious activity if the value is used for persistence.\n\nConsidering all these together, I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because there's a combination of PowerShell command-line activities that delete multiple files in a patterned manner. This kind of behavior can sometimes be indicative of malicious scripts trying to remove evidence or clean up after themselves. While individual events might not raise alarms, the overall pattern suggests something worth looking into.\n\nThe confidence level is about 0.7 because while there are concerning elements, they aren't definitively malicious without more context. It's a gray area that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating and deleting temporary files, along with specific file deletions in the TEMP directory, suggest potential suspicious activity such as script execution or cleanup behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

This could be suspicious because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement or to execute malicious commands. The fact that these commands are removing files might indicate an attempt to clean up traces or delete evidence.\n\nNext, I notice some events related to file creation by powershell.exe in different paths like the Download folder and AppData. Creating files in these locations could be part of establishing persistence or storing malicious scripts. It's also worth noting that one of these files has \"objeto_padrao\" which might not be standard naming convention.\n\nThere are several instances where Registry values are being set by various processes, including chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. While some legitimate software does modify the registry, multiple writes could signal configuration changes for persistence mechanisms or to alter system behavior.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe is another point of interest. It's often used to check user privileges, which might be a precursor to more malicious activities like privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nAdditionally, processes like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe interacting with the registry could be red flags if these aren't standard actions for those processes.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple indicators that suggest potential malicious activity: powershell script execution, file deletions in TEMP, creation of files in user directories, registry modifications by non-standard processes, and use of whoami.

The user wants me to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being accessed. There are several entries where the task is 'ProcessAccess' and others where it's 'ProcessCreate'. Then there are some whoami.exe executions. These seem normal because both PowerShell and whoami are standard tools used for various legitimate purposes.\n\nWait, but why so many ProcessAccess events? Maybe someone is accessing multiple processes or checking process lists. Also, the file events: one from winlogbeat creating a configuration file, which makes sense since it's the log shipping tool. Then there's a FileCreate event from PowerShell.exe for pacote_ativo.txt. The filename looks suspicious, \"pacote_ativo.txt\", which translates to \"active package\" in Portuguese. That could be a red flag because malicious actors often use such names for files related to payloads or commands.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell accesses and the creation of an unusually named file. This combination might indicate something fishy like script execution or data exfiltration. The high frequency of these events also raises concern as legitimate usage usually varies more in timing and actions.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the file creation by PowerShell with a suspicious name stands out, especially alongside repeated process accesses which could be part of lateral movement or data collection activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and creating files, including one named 'pacote_ativo.txt', which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. The first event shows File created related to the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's a bit unusual because I don't recall this file being commonly referenced in standard log files, especially when combined with multiple registry events.\n\nThen there are several Process Create and Registry value set tasks by powershell.exe. These actions could be normal administrative tasks, but they might also indicate something more nefarious like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. The fact that these events occur repeatedly is concerning.\n\nLooking further, I see whoami.exe being executed. While whoami is a standard command to check user information, its execution alongside other suspicious powershell activities could be part of an attack chain to gather system information or elevate privileges.\n\nThere are also multiple calls to remove files in the TEMP directory using powershell commands. These Remove-Item commands suggest that someone is trying to delete specific files without leaving traces. Persistent attempts to delete files might indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities, like deleting logs or evidence of previous actions.\n\nThe Image loaded events for various DLLs by powershell.exe are interesting. While .NET and CLR components are legitimate, their loading could be part of a larger script execution. If these are part of a script that's being run repeatedly, it might be a sign of a running malicious payload or a script attempting persistence.\n\nLastly, the File Create and subsequent File Delete events for __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 are worrying. This file name isn't standard; scripts with such names could be testing policy enforcement or trying to bypass certain security measures. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly suggests a possible attempt to avoid detection by dropping a malicious script temporarily.\n\nPutting all these together, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe performing actions that are often associated with malicious behavior—registry modifications, file deletions, potential persistence mechanisms, and attempts to delete logs. The combination of these activities raises red flags about potential unauthorized access or malicious activity on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious actions including registry modifications, file deletions, and creating\/removing temporary files.
