{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome is a browser that makes a lot of network requests. Nothing suspicious here on the surface.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe appearing several times. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious because it's often used for scripting but also by attackers for command execution. The events show ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDeleteDetected. These actions could indicate script execution or file manipulation.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines of powershell.exe:\n- One has a long command line with Get-ChildItem and setting LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". This looks like an attempt to modify file timestamps, which is a common tactic in malware to hide activity by making files appear older or newer than they are.\n- Another command line has similar patterns with different paths, suggesting multiple files might be targeted.\n\nThe FileCreate event creates a temporary script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1) and then immediately deletes it. This is a red flag because creating and deleting scripts quickly can be a way to evade detection or execute malicious code without leaving a long footprint.\n\nOther processes like whoami.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe also show some events, but they don't seem as concerning on their own. Notepad's RegistryEvent is also normal for legitimate use.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell with these specific commands suggests potential malicious activity, especially the file timestamp modifications and the quick creation\/deletion of a script file. This batch should be interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe instances performing suspicious activities including modifying file timestamps, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and accessing registry values, which are common indicators of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several events where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that modify file last write times. The commands are using Get-ChildItem to target specific files and then setting their LastWriteTime to January 1, 1970. This looks suspicious because changing file timestamps can be a tactic in obfuscating the age of malicious files or to make changes appear older than they are, which is common in attacks like steganography or persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there's an event where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll, and later Calculator.exe does the same. While this isn't immediately suspicious on its own, if combined with other behaviors, it could indicate that a calculator process is being used for some malicious activity, perhaps to execute code or load libraries outside of normal operations.\n\nThen, I notice svchost.exe making multiple Registry value sets. Svchost is a common process but can be abused by malware since it's a legitimate Windows process. Malware often uses svchost as a host for malicious activities, so these registry modifications could be setting up persistence or altering system configurations to allow further access.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are involved in file creation and registry events. Conhost is typically used by command-line tools, but if it's being spawned unexpectedly, it might indicate a malicious process trying to hide itself. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log management, so its involvement in creating files or modifying the registry needs context, but without more info, it could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. Chrome is a common application, and while these events might just be normal activity, repeated Registry modifications can sometimes be part of an attack to inject malicious code or alter system settings.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of powershell.exe modifying file timestamps, svchost.exe making registry changes, conhost.exe's involvement, and unusual processes accessing the registry could indicate a potential breach. The use of powershell for command-line operations is especially concerning because it's a tool often used by attackers for its legitimate appearance and powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear signs of immediate compromise, but these activities do raise red flags that suggest further investigation is necessary. It would be prudent to check the file integrity, review the recent changes made by svchost.exe and conhost.exe, and look into why powershell is modifying timestamps on those files.\n<\/think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the system log events, here's a structured conclusion:\n\n1. **Suspicious Powershell Activity**: Multiple events show powershell.exe modifying file last write times to January 1, 1970. This tactic may be used by attackers to hide recent malicious activities.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by svchost.exe**: The frequency of registry changes by svchost.exe is concerning, as it can be a vector for malware persistence or system configuration alteration.\n\n3. **Conhost and Winlogbeat Involvement**: Conhost.exe's unexpected spawning might indicate command-line tool misuse, while winlogbeat.exe's file creation could warrant further investigation.\n\n4. **Registry Changes by Chrome and ApplicationFrameHost**: Although less concerning individually, these changes should be monitored for any signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these events suggests potential cybersecurity risks. Further investigation is recommended to assess the integrity of affected files, review registry changes, and ensure no malware persistence mechanisms are in place."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and is asking me to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each event represents. Looking at the events:\n\n1. Most events are from `chrome.exe`, with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded'. These are common activities for Chrome as it interacts with system components.\n2. There's an event from `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file, which is likely part of log shipping or monitoring tools.\n3. An event from `powershell.exe` creating a file named 'unidade_logico.txt'â€”PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script injection, so this could be suspicious.\n\nNow, considering the batch as a whole, while individual events might not look malicious on their own, the repeated registry writes by Chrome could indicate something more. Malware sometimes uses legitimate processes like Chrome to hide its activities. The PowerShell event stands out because it's creating a file, which could be part of malicious script execution or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, without additional context, such as unusual timestamps, multiple failed attempts, or other anomalies, the batch doesn't show clear signs of an active attack. The events are spread out and don't exhibit rapid succession or indicators like privilege escalation.\n\nSo, while there's some cause for concern, especially with PowerShell, the overall pattern isn't alarming enough to warrant immediate investigation without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values and loading system files, as well as a file creation event from powershell.exe. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior or unusual system activity warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
