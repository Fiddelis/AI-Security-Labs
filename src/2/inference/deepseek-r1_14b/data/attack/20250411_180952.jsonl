{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: svchost.exe is a common Windows process, usually legitimate but sometimes used by malware. MpDefenderCoreService.exe is related to antivirus, so that seems normal.\n\nThen there are multiple chrome.exe entries with network connections and DNS queries, which makes sense because Chrome browses the web and connects to various domains.\n\nThe whoami.exe process caught my eye. It's a common tool for users to check their permissions, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nI noticed several powershell.exe instances with tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, and file creation. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The fact that it's accessing processes and registry values without obvious reason might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines for cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe, I see they're adding users and groups to the domain with names like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and commands like \"\/add \/domain\". This seems like an attempt to create new user accounts or add them to administrative groups, which could be part of a privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThere are multiple instances where net.exe and net1.exe are used in similar ways, creating users and adding them to Domain Admins. This repeated activity is concerning because it looks automated and possibly malicious, maybe from a script trying to compromise accounts.\n\nThe file creations by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe don't immediately seem suspicious, but the fact that they're modifying files in specific paths could be part of establishing persistence or logging activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several signs of potential attack: creating multiple admin-level users, using PowerShell for registry changes and process access, and repeated network connections. These behaviors are often indicators of a possible breach or attempted compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities such as creation of multiple domain admin accounts via command-line tools like cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe, which may indicate unauthorized access attempts. Additionally, the use of PowerShell for registry modifications and process access, along with repeated network connections, suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
