{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few entries show powershell.exe being executed with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The commands are setting up new tasks using New-ScheduledTaskAction, triggering at logon, and running under the Administrators group with highest privileges. The names of these tasks vary: unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc. This seems suspicious because creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThen there are some events where powershell.exe is just being run without command line details, but the winlog indicates things like Registry value set and Process accessed. That makes me think that PowerShell might be modifying registry settings or accessing other processes, which can be part of lateral movement or persistence in an attack.\n\nThere's also a process event for chrome.exe creating a pipe and setting registry values. While this isn't as immediately concerning as the PowerShell activity, it's worth noting because sometimes legitimate applications can have unusual behaviors, but I'm more focused on the PowerShell entries here.\n\nLooking further down, there are ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are part of .NET framework. This is normal for PowerShell as it uses .NET, so not a red flag on its own, but combined with the other activities, it adds context to the process's behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges across different names suggests that an attacker might be setting up persistence mechanisms. Scheduled tasks running at logon with admin rights can allow persistent access and execution of malicious code upon user login. The use of varied task names could indicate attempts to bypass detection or create multiple backdoors.\n\nAdditionally, the registry modifications and process accesses could be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement within the system. These activities don't necessarily prove an attack but are indicative behaviors that are often seen in cyberattacks.\n\nI'm also considering whether these events might be legitimate. Could a user or application legitimately need to create multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights? It's possible, but it's less common and usually would involve more structured logging or be part of a known process. The fact that the command lines are obfuscated within powershell.exe calls makes me lean towards malicious intent.\n\nSo, overall, this batch shows concerning behavior that could indicate an attack in progress or post-attack activity. The combination of creating multiple high-privilege scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and image loading from a process known for its scripting capabilities (PowerShell) is enough to classify this as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges suggest potential malicious activity. The creation of multiple tasks under the Administrators group and varied task names may indicate persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's look through each event.\n\nFirst, I see several events from powershell.exe where files are being loaded. These look normal because PowerShell often loads various DLLs when running scripts. The paths mentioned like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll are legitimate parts of the .NET framework, so that doesn't raise a red flag right away.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but when it's a PowerShell script, especially one with \"Script Policy Test\" in the name, it might be testing something related to script execution policies. But on its own, this could just be a test script or part of some automated process.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is running a command that schedules a task using New-ScheduledTaskAction and sets it to run calc.exe at logon with highest privileges. That definitely stands out because creating a scheduled task to execute calc.exe, which is typically harmless, but when combined with administrative rights and being set at logon, it could indicate persistence mechanisms. This might be an attempt to create a backdoor or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry value sets from chrome.exe. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, so many events without any other suspicious indicators could just be normal activity. However, they're worth keeping an eye on in combination with other events.\n\nFinally, there are several \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process or file information. These are concerning because executing remote commands can be a sign of command-line attacks or remote execution vulnerabilities. Without knowing the exact command, it's hard to say, but multiple such events increase suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together: The scheduled task setup using powershell.exe to run calc.exe at logon with admin rights is a red flag. It suggests potential malicious activity aiming for persistence and privilege escalation. Additionally, the remote command executions add more concern as they could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including creating and deleting a script file, setting up a scheduled task to run calc.exe with admin privileges, and multiple remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That sounds suspicious because executing remote commands can be a common tactic in cyberattacks, like command-line attacks or remote code execution. But looking at these entries, they all have 'process' as None, which might mean there's no specific process associated with them. Maybe it's just logging the fact that a remote command was executed without any further details.\n\nThen, there's an event where PowerShell is being used to create a scheduled task. The command line shows some Powershell code that creates a new scheduled task. This part catches my attention because using Powershell for creating tasks can be malicious. For example, attackers often use scheduled tasks to persistence on a system, meaning they can come back later after a reboot. The task is set to execute calc.exe at logon, which seems benign, but the way it's executed and the fact that it's being created programmatically might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where svchost.exe is modifying registry values multiple times. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but it's often used by malware to hide their activities because many processes run under this name. Multiple registry modifications without clear reason could be an indicator of malicious activity, as attackers might set registry keys for persistence or configuration.\n\nThere's also a file creation event by svchost.exe pointing to 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum'. That path seems arbitrary and not following standard Windows naming conventions. It might be creating a custom task in the system's Task Scheduler, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or a way to execute malicious code at startup.\n\nAnother event has powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell. That location is typically used by PowerShell for profile data, but non-interactive profiles are usually not expected to have much activity unless there's some script being executed upon login or session start. This could be part of a malicious script trying to establish persistence.\n\nThere are also events involving chrome.exe and conhost.exe making registry changes and loading various DLLs. While Chrome is a legitimate application, it's worth noting that in this case, it's modifying the registry and loading specific DLLs which might not be standard behavior. Additionally, conhost.exe is another process that can be used by attackers to execute commands or hide malicious activities.\n\nFinally, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which seems benign as it's likely part of log collection software, but the path in the AppData folder and the fact that it's being created might not be suspicious on its own unless there's more context.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple remote command executions, Powershell script execution creating a scheduled task with calc.exe (which could be a test or a payload), svchost.exe making numerous registry changes and creating files in unusual paths, and other processes modifying the system in ways that don't align with normal user activity. The combination of these events suggests potential malicious activities like persistence mechanisms, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some individual actions might not be suspicious on their own (like remote command execution without context), the repetition and the specific actions taken by processes like Powershell and svchost.exe point towards a coordinated attack. The use of scheduled tasks and registry modifications for persistence is a common tactic in cyberattacks, so this batch likely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including remote command executions, Powershell script execution creating a scheduled task, and svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files in unusual paths. These events indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this step by step. I have a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format with three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, looking at the events:\n\n1. The first seven entries are all from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's normal for Chrome since it often adjusts settings via the registry.\n2. Then there's an entry where chrome.exe makes a DNS query. Again, this is typical for browsers accessing websites.\n3. Next, winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely just updating or creating configuration files as part of its operation.\n4. Finally, powershell.exe creates a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. This catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nI need to determine if this entire batch is interesting. Most events are normal: Chrome adjusting settings, DNS queries, and Winlogbeat managing its files. However, the powershell.exe creating a file stands out. While it's not inherently suspicious on its own, combined with multiple registry writes from chrome.exe could indicate possible lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\n\nBut wait, the first seven entries all have the same process and action—maybe they're part of an update or legitimate activity. The only unusual thing is the powershell.exe creating a file in 'Downloads', which might be a red flag but not conclusive without more context. \n\nConsidering all events together, there's one event that raises suspicion but isn't enough to definitely classify it as malicious. Therefore, while interesting due to the potential misuse of PowerShell, it doesn't reach a high confidence level for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple Registry value set events by chrome.exe and a FileCreate event by powershell.exe which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
