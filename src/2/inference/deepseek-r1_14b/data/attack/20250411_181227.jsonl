The commands are creating tasks using `Register-ScheduledTask`, which suggests something is trying to run at logon or startup. The actions point to calc.exe, which seems harmless on its own but could be a precursor to malicious activity.\n\nThe repeated use of BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest indicates an attempt to elevate privileges, which is a red flag because attackers often try to escalate their access. Also, the task names like 'unidade_ativo' and 'tarefa_base' don't seem standard, so that's suspicious.\n\nLooking at other events, there are instances where PowerShell accesses registry keys and processes. This aligns with common techniques used in attacksâ€”using legitimate tools for malicious purposes. The fact that several of these events occur in quick succession makes me think it's part of a broader attack campaign.\n\nThe last few events show image loads related to .NET components, which is normal for PowerShell but could be part of obfuscating malicious code or loading libraries needed for the attack.\n\nPutting this all together, it looks like someone is attempting persistence on the system by creating scheduled tasks. This could lead to unauthorized access or data exfiltration later. The combination of multiple suspicious activities points towards a potential security threat that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands to create scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, potentially indicating malicious activity such as persistence or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this cybersecurity problem. I'm given a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Powershell.exe loads MpOAV.dll. Defender components are usually benign, so nothing suspicious here.\n2. **Event 2**: Powershell creates a temporary file. This is common when running scripts, especially PS1 files. But the naming looks random, which might be normal but could indicate script execution.\n3. **Event 3**: The same temp file is deleted. Deleting temporary files after use isn't unusual, but if it's part of malicious activity, they might delete to cover tracks. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n4. **Event 4**: Powershell creates a pipe. Pipes are used for interprocess communication. Could be legitimate or part of a larger attack chain.\n5. **Event 5**: Powershell command line shows creating a scheduled task with calc.exe at logon as admins. This is concerning because calc.exe isn't typically run at logon by admins. Scheduled tasks created via PS might indicate persistence mechanisms for malware.\n6. **Events 6-13**: Chrome.exe modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome does alter the registry, multiple changes could be part of normal operation but might warrant a closer look if they're unusual or in bulk.\n7. **Events 14-28**: Multiple \"Execute Remote Command\" events with no process or file info. These are vague and could indicate remote execution attempts, which is a red flag for potential attacks like RDP brute force or command injection.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- The batch shows multiple powershell.exe instances creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon as admins. This is suspicious because calc.exe isn't typical in such contexts; more likely, this would be a way to run malicious code with elevated privileges.\n- There are also repeated attempts to execute remote commands, which could be an attacker trying different methods or tools to gain access.\n- While some events might be legitimate (like Chrome registry changes), the combination of powershell creating scheduled tasks and multiple remote command executions strongly suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nI'm moderately confident about this assessment because while individual events aren't all suspicious, the pattern together raises red flags. The confidence is 80% because it's possible these could still be legitimate actions if part of a specific software's normal behavior, but given the scheduled task setup and remote commands, it leans towards malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Powershell.exe is flagged for creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe at logon as admins, which is unusual.\n\n2. **Analyze Event Patterns:**\n   - Multiple \"Execute Remote Command\" events suggest potential unauthorized access attempts.\n\n3. **Consider Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - Creation of admin-level scheduled tasks and remote command executions are IoCs for possible malware persistence or attack.\n\n4. **Assess Context and Impact:**\n   - These activities could indicate a breach, allowing attackers to maintain persistence and escalate privileges.\n\n5. **Determine Confidence Level:**\n   - Given the combination of events and their potential impact, confidence is high that these logs are indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch contains suspicious activities including Powershell creating admin-level scheduled tasks and multiple remote command executions. These suggest possible unauthorized access or malware persistence. The assessment concludes they are likely **interesting for investigation**, with a high confidence level indicating potential security concerns. \n\n**Answer:**  \nThe events are indicative of malicious activity, making them highly interesting for investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through them one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. Hmm, WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, which can be legitimate but sometimes used maliciously. Loading taskschd.dll sounds normal for scheduling tasks, so maybe not too suspicious yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, often involved with services. But seeing it set registry values could indicate something, especially if done repeatedly. However, it's also possible this is part of normal service operations.\n\nThen, another svchost creates a file in the Tasks folder. That's where scheduled tasks go, so maybe setting up a task. Not sure if that's bad on its own, but combined with other events could be concerning.\n\nThere are two instances of \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This stands out because executing remote commands can be a sign of remote access tools or command-line attacks. It might mean someone is trying to run commands over the network, which could be malicious.\n\nPowershell.exe creating files in user directories. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for scripting and execution. Creating files in the Startup folder sounds like it could be persistence mechanisms, where malware adds entries to run at startup.\n\nConhost.exe and chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. Conhost is a host process for console applications; seeing it modify the registry might not be common. Chrome modifying the registry could be part of its update process or extensions, but repeated writes might indicate something else.\n\nMultiple Dns queries from chrome.exe. Browsers do make DNS requests regularly, so this might not be suspicious unless they're resolving to known malicious domains.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating configuration files is normal if it's an agent running, but seeing the same file path in two events makes me think maybe there's something about how it's being used or configured.\n\nPowershell creating another file in the downloads folder. Could be part of legitimate script execution, but also a way to drop malicious files.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple svchost.exe and powershell activities, remote command executions, and repeated registry modifications. These could indicate potential signs of malware or unauthorized access. Powershell is especially concerning because it's often used in attacks for its execution capabilities. The remote commands might be part of an attack chain, like initial access or lateral movement. The file creations in user directories and startup areas could be persistence mechanisms.\n\nSo overall, while some events are normal, the combination raises flags that this batch could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the log events suggests potential signs of cybersecurity concern:\n\n1. **WmiPrvSE.exe**: Loading taskschd.dll is generally legitimate but can sometimes be used maliciously. However, it's not inherently suspicious on its own.\n\n2. **svchost.exe Activity**: The multiple instances of svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files in the Tasks folder could indicate normal service operations or potential malicious activity. Given the frequency, this warrants closer monitoring.\n\n3. **Execute a Remote Command**: This event is notable as it can be associated with remote access tools or command-line attacks, suggesting possible unauthorized access.\n\n4. **Powershell.exe Activities**: The creation of files in user directories, particularly the Startup folder, could indicate persistence mechanisms commonly used by malware to ensure continued execution upon system restarts.\n\n5. **Conhost.exe and Chrome.exe**: Modifying registry values, especially repeatedly, might not be typical for these processes and could signal unusual activity.\n\n6. **Dns Queries from Chrome.exe**: While browsers regularly make DNS requests, monitoring the specific domains queried could provide further insight into potential malicious activity.\n\n7. **Winlogbeat.exe**: The creation of configuration files is normal if part of its operation, but duplication might indicate misconfiguration or misuse.\n\n8. **File Creation by Powershell.exe**: This could be legitimate script execution or a method to drop malicious files, necessitating further investigation.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these events, particularly the use of Powershell for potential persistence and remote command executions, raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or malware activity. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these log entries and take appropriate action if necessary."}
