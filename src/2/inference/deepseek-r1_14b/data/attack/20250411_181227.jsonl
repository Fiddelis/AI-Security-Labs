{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe being executed with command lines that create scheduled tasks. Each command is similar but has slight variations in the task names (like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc.). The fact that each task is set to run at logon and is assigned to the BUILTIN\\Administrators group with the highest privileges raises a red flag. Such tasks could potentially be used for persistence, allowing malicious code to run every time a user logs in.\n\nLooking deeper, these scheduled tasks execute calc.exe as their action. While calc.exe itself isn't malicious, it's often used by attackers as a decoy or to test if the command execution works. The use of powershell.exe to create these tasks is concerning because PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be abused for various malicious activities, including downloading and executing other payloads.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and processes. These actions might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or gather information, which are common behaviors in early stages of an attack. The file paths loaded by powershell.exe (like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll) are part of the .NET framework, so they're legitimate. However, their loading could be monitored for any unusual activities.\n\nAnother point is that while most events are related to powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks, there's one entry involving chrome.exe creating a pipe and accessing registry values. This might not be directly malicious but could be part of normal operations or something to keep an eye on, especially if combined with other indicators.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks by powershell.exe targeting high-privilege accounts is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. The combination of these events suggests possible persistence mechanisms and unauthorized system changes, which are critical signs for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with high privileges, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is 'Registry value set'. Chrome doing some registry changes isn't unusual because browsers often adjust settings or extensions which require such access. I don't immediately see a red flag here unless these activities are outside normal usage patterns.\n\nNext, towards the end of the events, there's a process named 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the data directory with a .yml extension. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used for log collection, so it making configuration changes or writing to its own logs isn't concerning on its own.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process that created a file called 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. However, without additional context like unusual command-line arguments or writes to known malicious locations, it's hard to say if this action is harmful. It might just be part of legitimate system administration tasks.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, I don't see any events that are clearly indicative of malicious activity. There's a lot of repeated registry changes by Chrome, which doesn't seem abnormal. The only slightly concerning parts are the creation of the .yml file and the PowerShell activity, but without more data, these might just be normal operations.\n\nI'm also considering if there's any correlation between these events. For example, multiple registry writes could indicate something, but since they're all from Chrome, it seems like standard behavior. The winlogbeat file is expected as part of its operation, and the PowerShell script without other signs isn't enough to raise an alarm.\n\nSo overall, while I'm cautious about the PowerShell activity, there's not enough evidence in this batch alone to classify it as malicious or even particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal activities such as Chrome making registry changes and legitimate file operations by winlogbeat.exe. The PowerShell activity is not clearly malicious without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, I've been given a bunch of JSONL events and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Hmm, first I'll start by looking at each event one by one to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all involve powershell.exe loading different files. The tasks are either Image loaded or File operations. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously. But maybe it's just normal activity? I should check more events.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory by powershell.exe and then immediately deleted. Creating and deleting files quickly could be a sign of trying to avoid detection. Also, later on, there's a command line showing some PowerShell script that creates a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with admin privileges might indicate persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThen I see several events from chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. While this could be normal for browser updates or settings, the number of changes is quite high (six times), which might warrant looking into whether it's legitimate activity or something else, like a script running in the background altering system settings.\n\nThe latter part of the logs has several events where \"Execute a Remote Command\" is logged. Since there's no associated process or file, this could imply that a remote command was executed without proper context, which might be an indicator of unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe doing suspicious things like creating\/deleting files in Temp and setting up scheduled tasks, combined with chrome.exe making numerous registry changes, and the remote command executions. These activities don't seem to align with typical user behavior and could be signs of malware or an attack.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about whether the chrome.exe actions are normal, but given that it's part of the same batch as other suspicious events, I should consider them collectively. The overall pattern suggests potential malicious activity, so I think this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe loading potentially malicious files, creating\/deleting temporary files, executing a scheduled task with calc.exe, and numerous registry modifications by chrome.exe. Additionally, remote command executions without associated processes raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let's take a look at what's going on here. Each line is a JSON object representing an event, and there are quite a few of themâ€”let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first ten events, they all have \"winlog\" tasks labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command\". That seems suspicious because executing remote commands can be a common tactic in cyber attacks, like remote code execution. But I should check if there's any other context around these events. Looking at their \"process\" and \"file\" fields, most are \"None\", which means there's no additional info on what process or file was involved. That lack of detail makes it harder to assess the intent, but the repetition is concerning.\n\nThen, event 11 stands out because the process field shows a PowerShell command being executed. The command line has some encoded stuff: it mentions creating a scheduled task with \"calc.exe\" as the action. Using calc.exe might be an attempt to execute malicious code since it's typically used for calculations but can be abused. Also, the scheduled task is set to run at logon with high privileges under Administrators. That sounds like persistence mechanisms attackers use to maintain access. The fact that it's using powershell.exe adds another layer because PowerShell is often misused for attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nMoving on, event 12 shows WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. I recall that WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and sometimes used in malicious activities. The file path seems legitimate, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThe next few events (13-15) involve svchost.exe making registry changes. Svchost is a standard system process, but unusual registry activity can indicate tampering or installation of malicious services. Since these are repeated, it could be an attempt to modify system configurations in bulk, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nEvent 16 shows svchost.exe creating a file under C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks with the name \"unidade_comum\". That's interesting because task files usually have .job extensions. The name seems suspicious, perhaps trying to blend in but not quite matching standard naming conventions.\n\nThen there are events involving powershell.exe again (event 18), creating a file in the user's AppData directory under PowerShell's StartupProfileData. This could be an attempt to execute scripts at startup, another persistence method. Also, event 20 has conhost.exe modifying registry values, which is unusual because conhost is typically related to command-line interfaces and shouldn't need to change registry settings without cause.\n\nEvents involving chrome.exe are a bit tricky. They show loading of system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate processes for anti-malware scans. However, the repeated registry writes might indicate something else is amiss, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThe last few events involve winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files and powershell.exe creating another file in the user's Downloads folder. These could be part of log collection or exfiltration processes if they're related to malicious activities earlier in the logs.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a pattern here that suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated remote command executions, especially with PowerShell, scheduled tasks, and registry modifications under svchost and conhost are red flags. These activities could be part of an attack chainâ€”gaining access, establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and possibly exfiltrating data.\n\nI'm a bit uncertain because some events might just be legitimate system operations or even false positives, especially the ones from chrome.exe which is a common browser. However, considering the combination of PowerShell usage with suspicious command lines, creation of scheduled tasks, and multiple registry modifications under different processes, it's highly likely that this batch of logs indicates malicious behavior that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity including remote command executions, suspicious PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks, and unusual file creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
