{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to `powershell.exe`. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so it's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nLooking at the events, I see several instances where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading images. These actions could be part of normal operation, but they might also indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or load malicious code. For example, setting registry values can be used to persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nThere's also a file creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`) by `powershell.exe`. This is concerning because creating and then deleting a script file could be an attempt to avoid detection, possibly executing malicious code before deleting evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are repeated entries where the command line for `powershell.exe` is empty or only contains `& {}`, which might be an obfuscation technique. Empty command lines can make it harder to trace the exact commands executed, raising suspicion about the intent behind these processes.\n\nOther events include file creations by `winlogbeat.exe`, which seems unrelated, and several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These could be normal for a running PowerShell process but might complement other suspicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command-line arguments, registry modifications, script file creation\/deletion, and obfuscation techniques suggests a high confidence that this batch is interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the registry, creating temporary files, and suspicious command line arguments suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is WMIC.exe loading a DLL file from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal since WMIC is a legitimate tool and the path looks correct.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values. Registry writes can be part of legitimate operations or malicious activity. Since they're common processes, it's hard to say immediately if this is suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines: cmd.exe was used with 'copy' and 'schtasks' commands. The 'schtasks \/delete' suggests someone might be trying to remove a scheduled task, which could be an attempt to cover their tracks or legitimate admin work.\n\nPowershell.exe is appearing several times without any obvious malicious command-line arguments. Powershell can do both good and bad things, so this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nConhost.exe is used by remote desktop services; seeing it here is normal.\n\nThere's a 'whoami.exe' being run, which just gets user information. Not malicious on its own.\n\nSchtasks.exe was used to delete a task called 'win32times'. This might be an attempt to remove persistent malware or legitimate cleanup. Without knowing the context of this task, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple process creations, registry writes, and deletion of a scheduled task. These could indicate someone trying to clean up after malicious activities or just regular system administration tasks. There's no clear evidence of direct malicious behavior in these logs. So I'd classify this as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence because each action alone isn't suspicious enough without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creations, registry modifications, and legitimate use of tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe.

I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, they all seem to be process creations or actions related to processes and registry changes. For example, there are multiple entries for 'cmd.exe', 'powershell.exe', and 'whoami.exe'. These are common tools that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. I remember that attackers often use these tools because they're built-in and less likely to raise suspicions.\n\nI notice a lot of RegistryEvent tasks. So, processes are modifying the registry. That's something to watch because changing system settings can be part of persistence mechanisms or installing malware. On the other hand, many normal system operations also affect the registry, so it's not always suspicious.\n\nThere's an event where 'schtasks.exe' loaded 'taskschd.dll'. Schtasks is used for scheduling tasks, and loading that DLL might be normal, but I'm not sure if this specific path is standard. Maybe it's part of a legitimate operation or could indicate something else.\n\nI see several 'Process Create' events for various executables. Since these are common processes, it's hard to say without more context like timestamps or frequency of use. If they were created at unexpected times or in large numbers, that might be more concerning.\n\nThe event with 'whoami.exe' is interesting because it's often used by attackers to check user information. But again, legitimate users might also run it for system info. So, without additional context, it's hard to judge.\n\nLooking overall, there are a lot of events involving these executables and registry changes. While individually they might not be suspicious, the sheer number could indicate something is off. Maybe an attacker is trying multiple approaches or testing different things. Alternatively, it could just be normal system activity with several users or scripts running.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being 'INTERESTING' because of the high volume of potentially suspicious activities and the use of tools that can have dual purposes. But I'm not entirely sure if each event on its own is enough to conclude something malicious without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist primarily of common system processes and registry modifications, which are typical in a normal operating environment.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see if anything stands out.\n\nFirst, there's RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because RuntimeBroker handles runtime aspects for processes like Windows Store apps. Not suspicious.\n\nNext, notepad.exe doing the same thing—RegistryEvent. Notpad is commonly used, so no red flags here either.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing something via ProcessAccess. Powershell can do legitimate tasks, but it's often a tool attackers use, so I'll keep an eye on how many times it appears and what it does.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator shouldn't need that DLL. URLMON is related to URL handling, which might indicate some malicious activity trying to bypass AMSI or something similar.\n\n_svchost.exe_ appearing multiple times with RegistryEvent tasks. Svchost is a common process for services, but multiple instances could be a sign of something being loaded or modified in the registry, possibly by malware.\n\nAnother svchost.exe event—nothing unusual yet on its own.\n\nCalculator.exe again loading urlmon.dll. That's another point suggesting potential tampering with legitimate processes to hide malicious activities.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file—assuming it's running as intended, maybe for log shipping, so probably fine unless there are other anomalies.\n\nPowershell.exe ProcessAccess again—no immediate issue, but combined with the previous events, could be part of an attack chain.\n\nWhoami.exe executed from command line. A simple info tool, but in some cases used maliciously to check permissions or system details. Still not conclusive on its own.\n\nAnother powershell.exe ProcessAccess event—this is getting repetitive, possibly indicating a script being run multiple times or legitimate usage.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry values—it's part of the Windows shell, so normal activity here.\n\nCalculator.exe again with RegistryEvent—so it's modifying the registry. That might be suspicious if combined with other events pointing towards similar behavior.\n\nMultiple powershell.exe entries show up, which is a red flag because attackers often use Powershell for command execution and persistence.\n\nChrome.exe creating a pipe and setting registry values—standard behavior unless part of a broader attack vector.\n\nCmd.exe running a wmic process to delete notepad.exe. Using cmd with WMIC to delete processes could be legitimate admin activity or an attempt to cover tracks by deleting evidence, like terminating sandboxes or debuggers.\n\nWMIC.exe creating processes to delete notepad.exe—this is a classic technique used in malware for deletion of files or processes without being detected by certain monitoring tools.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, there's a pattern of Powershell and cmd with WMIC commands attempting to delete processes. The repeated use of these tools, especially in conjunction with registry modifications and loading unusual DLLs into legitimate processes like calc.exe and Calculator.exe, suggests possible malicious activity. These actions might be part of an attempt to hide traces or establish persistence.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of multiple Powershell instances, cmd.exe with WMIC deleting processes, andDLL injections into normal apps are all indicative of potential attack tactics. While some events could be benign, the cumulative effect points towards something that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated use of Powershell.exe and cmd.exe with WMIC commands to delete processes, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated use might be a red flag. The command lines in some events have if statements checking for the existence of specific .bat files. If these files exist, they exit with 0; otherwise, 1.\n\nLooking at the file paths like \"C:\\entrada_principal\\\" and others, I notice that they're structured but could potentially be part of a script or module trying to establish persistence or spread across the system. The use of Test-Path suggests they're checking for specific files, which might indicate file creation or deletion activities.\n\nRegistry value sets in the events are also notable because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. Combined with the process access tasks, this could imply that powershell is accessing other processes, possibly to inject code or gather information.\n\nThe mention of MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll loading might be part of legitimate operations, but sometimes malware uses these DLLs for obfuscation or to hide malicious activities under common processes.\n\nConhost.exe being involved in registry events is interesting because it's a host process for console applications. Malware often uses such processes to execute code without being easily detected.\n\nOverall, the repeated powershell use with varied command lines checking for files and accessing the registry suggests possible malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence or lateral movement within the system. The batch shows multiple indicators that could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events involve multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands that check for specific files and modifying the registry, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with command lines checking for file existence and modifying the registry, potentially indicating malicious behavior or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. All the events are related to powershell.exe processes, which immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script injection.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe being executed with a complex command line. The command creates new items in specific paths and sets content to \"dir\", which might be an attempt to create or overwrite batch files. This behavior could be malicious if these files are intended to execute commands on the system.\n\nSubsequent events show multiple ImageLoad tasks, indicating that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs. While this isn't inherently suspicious, it's worth noting because attackers sometimes use legitimate processes to load malicious libraries. However, in this case, the DLL paths seem normal, so maybe not a cause for concern here.\n\nThe later events repeat similar patterns with different file paths and all have the 'Provider Lifecycle' task type. This repetition suggests automated or script-driven activity, which could be part of a broader attack strategy to create persistence points across the system.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event might look benign on its own, the combination—especially multiple writes to various files using powershell.exe and repeated patterns—points toward potential malicious activity. This could be an attempt at creating persistence mechanisms or dropping malicious scripts onto the system. Therefore, this batch should definitely be looked into further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating and modifying files with suspicious command lines, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware might use it to execute scripts or commands without being easily detected.\n\nLooking at the events, there are several instances where files are being created and deleted in temporary directories. For example, one event shows a file being created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest... Then, another event deletes that same file. This pattern of creating and immediately deleting files could be an attempt to avoid detection or to test if certain actions are allowed.\n\nThere's also a process where PowerShell is checking if specific .bat files exist using Test-Path. The command lines in the logs show conditions like {if (Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}. This seems suspicious because it's checking for the presence of files that might not be expected in a normal environment. If these files don't exist, the script exits with an error code, which could be part of a larger malicious process.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading different DLLs, like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, unusual loading patterns or combined with other activities might indicate something more nefarious.\n\nOn the other side, there are several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome can make changes to the registry for its settings, repeated registry writes could be a sign of malicious activity trying to persist across reboots. However, given that they're all from the same process and it's just setting values, I'm not sure if this is enough on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell activities—creating temporary files, deleting them immediately, checking for specific script files, loading various DLLs—and Chrome modifying registry entries raises concerns. These actions don't appear to be normal user behavior and could indicate a potential attack or malware attempting to execute malicious scripts or establish persistence on the system.\n\nI'm confident enough that these events are unusual and potentially indicative of malicious activity, but I wouldn't say it's certain without more context.

Let's see.\n\nFirst, multiple events involve powershell.exe, which is commonly used by both legitimate scripts and attackers. The command lines show the creation of .bat files in different paths, like 'modulo_base' and 'pacote_temporario'. Creating new batch files can be benign but also a red flag for malicious activity.\n\nI notice several file operations: creating and deleting files, which might indicate an attempt to leave or clean up traces. The deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1' after creation is suspicious because attackers often delete temporary scripts to avoid detection.\n\nRegistry modifications are present too. Powershell setting registry values could be configuring settings or persistence mechanisms, which is concerning as it's a common technique in malware for creating autorun entries or disabling security features.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a mix of ImageLoad and Process events. The loading of specific DLLs like MpClient.dll might suggest interaction with antivirus software, possibly an attempt to bypass detection.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe across multiple events without clear legitimate purpose raises concern. Legitimate scripts usually don't create so many files in varied locations or delete temporary files quickly.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows several red flags: creation\/deletion of scripts, registry changes, and repeated powershell activity across different directories.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several events where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific .bat files. The paths in these commands seem structured but not immediately suspicious. They're using 'Test-Path' to check if certain scripts exist and exiting based on that. However, this behavior could be part of a legitimate script checking mechanism or it might be an attempt to verify if malicious scripts are present before proceeding.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell loads the MpOAV.dll file from Windows Defender. This is normal as Defender often interacts with PowerShell for various operations, including antivirus scans and policy enforcement. It doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nThen, I notice a file creation event in the Temp directory by PowerShell: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1'. This filename looks like it's part of Windows' Script Policy Test feature, which checks if scripts are allowed to run. The fact that this file is created and then deleted shortly after could be an attempt to avoid detection, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are also events where PowerShell deletes the temporary script file. This might just be part of a cleanup process, especially if the script ran successfully or failed. However, combined with the creation event, it might indicate that the script was executed and then removed to erase its trace.\n\nLooking further, there are events related to registry access and process access in PowerShell. These could be part of normal operations, like checking for certain configurations or processes, but they can also be signs of malicious activity trying to gather information or modify system settings.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe. This seems related to log shipping and isn't concerning on its own unless there's evidence that this tool was misconfigured or being used maliciously, which there's no indication of here.\n\nLastly, there are events where PowerShell interacts with the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. These could be part of legitimate profile initialization but might also hint at script execution during system startup, which could be problematic if the scripts aren't authorized.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances checking for specific files, creating and deleting temporary scripts, interacting with system components like Defender, and accessing registry entries. While each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated checks and deletions of temporary files might indicate an attempt to hide or test malicious code execution.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags when considering all events together. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context or additional indicators like timestamps or process ancestry.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances checking for specific files and creating\/deleting temporary scripts suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's pretty normal because whoami is a standard tool used for identifying user information, so that doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe accessed. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious depending on usage. But here, it's just being accessed, which isn't unusual yet.\n\nLooking at the third event, there's a PowerShell command line with an If statement checking for the existence of several files. The command is using Test-Path to check if specific .exe files exist in various directories. This seems suspicious because attackers often check for the presence of certain files before executing commands. It could be part of a script trying to verify if previous malicious activities were successful or if certain tools are present.\n\nContinuing, I notice multiple similar events with different paths being checked. Each time, it's checking for a specific file and exiting with 0 if found, else 1. This repetition makes me think it's part of a loop or script that's trying to access several files across the system. Such behavior could be an attempt to establish persistence or check for dropped malware components.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is created again with similar command lines but different file paths. The use of \"&\" in the command line suggests it's executing multiple commands, which can sometimes be a way to obfuscate or chain malicious activities.\n\nAnother event shows that powershell.exe is setting a registry value. This could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, which is a common tactic for persistence—like adding registry entries to run scripts on startup.\n\nLooking further, several events show images being loaded by powershell.exe, including mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework. While these are legitimate DLLs used by PowerShell, their loading can sometimes be part of malicious activities like creating reflective payloads or obfuscating code.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing various files across the system, attempting to create processes, setting registry values, and loading images. These actions don't necessarily indicate a confirmed breach but exhibit behaviors that are often associated with malicious actors trying to establish persistence, gather information, or execute payloads.\n\nThe repetitive pattern of checking for specific files suggests automated scripting, which could be part of an attack chain such as lateral movement or privilege escalation. The combination of process creation, registry modifications, and image loading adds more layers to the potential concern.\n\nTherefore, while not conclusive evidence of a breach, these events collectively present enough red flags to merit closer investigation.

So, the logs are all in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that they involve 'powershell.exe' with various tasks like Image loaded and File creation\/deletion. This catches my attention because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The fact that there's a file named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1' being created and then deleted might indicate some kind of script execution or testing.\n\nThen, I notice several events where 'powershell.exe' is checking the existence of specific files using Test-Path in its command line. This could be a way for an attacker to verify if certain binaries are present before proceeding with malicious activities. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\...\" and others seem arbitrary, but they might be part of some payload delivery or component check.\n\nThere's also an event where 'whoami.exe' is executed, which is often used by attackers to gather information about the system's user context. Additionally, 'cmd.exe' is used with a command that checks for a file named 'objeto_logico.txt', which could be part of a payload execution or persistence mechanism.\n\nThe repeated Registry value sets in PowerShell logs are concerning too because adversaries often use registry modifications to maintain persistence or configure settings for malicious activities. The multiple ProcessAccess and PipeCreated events might suggest the creation of communication channels between processes, possibly to avoid detection or coordinate attacks.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, many of these actions could also be part of normal system operations, especially if there's a lot of script execution or legitimate use of PowerShell. But given the combination of file deletions after creation, specific file checks, registry modifications, and the use of multiple tools like whoami.exe and cmd.exe, it does raise some red flags.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the sequence and variety suggest potential malicious activity.

Each time, I wonder what commands they're running. If these were just access checks without any malicious code execution, maybe not too bad. But combined with the other events...\n\nLooking further, some events show Registry value sets. That could be modifying system settings, which might be part of an attack.\n\nThe next few logs are powershell.exe processes with specific command lines. Each is using an if statement to check for the existence of certain .cs files and then exiting based on that. The paths in these commands seem to point to various locations like \"estrutura_temporario.cs\" or \"unidade_principal.cs\". This seems unusual because why would a script be checking so many different files across different directories? It might indicate some form of file presence check, possibly as part of a persistence mechanism or to ensure certain files exist before proceeding with malicious activities.\n\nMoreover, the repetition of similar command lines in each event suggests that this isn't just an isolated incident but part of a larger script execution. The fact that they're using Powershell with these specific checks could be indicative of scripting behavior often seen in attacks, like checking if the system is already compromised before dropping additional payloads or executing other commands.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where powershell.exe loads various .NET libraries (mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc.).

That's a common tool for both admins and attackers, so it can be tricky. The first few events show ImageLoad and FileCreate tasks from Windows Defender Platform files. That seems normal because Defender scans these areas, but I'm not sure if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there's a file creation in the user's Temp directory with a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. That looks temporary and might be part of Windows' own testing or scripting policies. But the same script is deleted later, which could indicate some kind of process cleanup. Maybe it's part of a legitimate check or maybe something malicious trying to hide its tracks.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands checking if certain files exist using Test-Path. The exit codes based on whether these files exist suggest that someone is verifying if specific scripts or executables are present on the system. This could be part of a legitimate process like deployment checks or automated tasks, but it might also be an attacker ensuring their tools are in place before executing something else.\n\nThere's also a Registry value set event and Process access events for whoami.exe. Using whoami is common for getting user information, which can be both normal and malicious depending on context. The combination of checking files, accessing registry, and running whoami could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts across different paths make me think that an attacker might be trying to execute a keylogger script but is first ensuring it's present. Alternatively, it could be part of some automated process checking for certain files, but the pattern seems too consistent and focused on potentially malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell instances, file creation\/deletion in Temp, registry changes, whoami execution, and repeated checks for specific scripts—it feels like a coordinated attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code. While some actions could be benign, the overall pattern suggests possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, repeated checks for specific scripts, and use of whoami.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that powershell.exe is involved in several activities: creating files, accessing processes, and modifying registry values. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers to execute commands and scripts. The fact that it's accessing different parts of the system could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there are events involving whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is usually benign but can sometimes be used for reconnaissance to gather user information, which might be part of an attack chain.\n\nNotepad.exe writing to the registry seems a bit unusual because notepad isn't typically used for that. Registry modifications can be malicious, especially if they're done by unknown processes.\n\nSVCHost.exe events show network connections and registry writes. SVCHOST is a common process but it's often used by legitimate services as well as malware. The fact that it's making network connections might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other activities, it could raise flags.\n\nThe Calculator.exe event loads urlmon.dll, which isn't the usual behavior for a calculator. This seems odd and possibly malicious, as loading unexpected DLLs can indicate a compromise.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files is interesting because it's an ELK-related tool, commonly used for log management. Its presence might not be suspicious unless it's doing something unexpected like modifying system configurations or making network calls.\n\nThe Chrome events show multiple network connections and DNS queries, which could be normal user activity but also worth monitoring if they're unusually frequent.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are several red flags: powershell.exe accessing various resources, whoami.exe being used, notepad.exe writing to the registry, svchost.exe making network calls, calculator.exe loading an unusual DLL, and winlogbeat creating files. These activities don't necessarily indicate a confirmed breach, but they do raise concerns about potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm considering the confidence level as 0.7 because while each event on its own could be benign, the combination suggests possible malicious activity. However, without more context or additional indicators like failed attempts or known malicious IPs, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe process access, whoami.exe execution, registry modifications by notepad.exe and svchost.exe, network connections from svchost.exe and chrome.exe, unusual DLL load by Calculator.exe, and file creation by winlogbeat.exe. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there's a process named chrome.exe making a DNS query. That seems normal because browsers do that all the time. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed, which is a bit concerning since PowerShell can be used for malicious activities. But not every use of PowerShell is bad; sometimes it's just legitimate admin work.\n\nNext, whoami.exe was run without any command line arguments beyond its own path. That doesn't seem too suspicious on its own—it might be part of some system check or script. Then again, more powershell.exe accesses follow. This repetition could indicate a user running multiple PowerShell commands, which is something to note but not immediately alarming.\n\nThere's an event where PowerShell sets a registry value. Registry modifications by scripts can be legitimate but can also be used for persistence in malware. So this might raise an eyebrow, especially if it's done repeatedly or in unexpected places.\n\nLooking further, there are several Image Load events from PowerShell loading various DLLs. That's standard when running scripts because PowerShell needs to load different components. But the specific paths here look like they're part of .NET Framework and Windows Defender, which seems normal.\n\nThen, a file is created and then deleted in the Temp directory by PowerShell. This could be part of script execution testing or trying to avoid detection. The fact that the file was quickly deleted might suggest something fishy, but it's also possible it was just temporary data being handled.\n\nThe last few events mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" without specific file info, which is a bit vague. It's hard to tell if this is normal operation or part of some malicious activity.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell instances running with certain command lines, accessing the registry, loading various modules, creating and deleting temporary files. This could indicate script execution, possibly trying to enumerate the system (ls, get-childitem commands). The repeated process creations and actions might suggest a user executing scripts for legitimate reasons, but also could be signs of reconnaissance or malicious activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because while some events are common, the combination—like creating temp files, deleting them, setting registry values—might indicate something more than just normal usage. The confidence is high because there's a cluster of activities that together suggest potential malicious behavior, but I can't be certain without deeper analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with suspicious command lines, including file creation and deletion in temporary directories, as well as registry modifications. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first two events both show powershell.exe being executed with the command line arguments involving ls, get-childitem, and gci. These commands are typically used for listing files and directories, which could be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement in an attack. The task in these cases is either Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle, which might relate to how Windows processes start up.\n\nThe third event shows powershell.exe loading a DLL file from the Windows Defender directory. This seems unusual because I don't expect legitimate scripts to load such specific files unless it's part of some malicious activity trying to hide itself by using legitimate tools.\n\nThen there are events involving winlogbeat.exe, which is likely an ELK stack component used for log management. The tasks here involve file creation in the data directory, which might be normal if this tool is running and creating config files. However, I should check if any of these files are being created unexpectedly or with unusual paths.\n\nLooking at the later events, powershell.exe again appears multiple times with tasks like File Created and Registry value set. The fact that powershell is being used extensively could be a red flag because it's a common tool for both sysadmins and attackers. Additionally, registry modifications without legitimate reason might indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also events where conhost.exe sets registry values. Conhost is usually related to console windows but seeing it modify the registry isn't typical and could be suspicious.\n\nOverall, I notice a pattern of powershell executions with potentially malicious commands, loading unusual DLLs, and multiple registry modifications. These activities together might suggest command-line abuse for malicious purposes. The repeated use of powershell and the specific commands used could indicate an attacker exploring the system or establishing persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity, including command line arguments that may be indicative of reconnaissance or malicious behavior, combined with registry modifications and file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
