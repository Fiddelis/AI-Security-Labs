{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`. These commands are often used in legitimate scripts, but I also know they can be part of malicious activities like creating scheduled tasks. The command lines here look suspicious because they're trying to execute PowerShell with the `-ep bypass` flag, which is a common technique to avoid detection.\n\nThere's an attempt to create a task using `schtasks.exe` that runs every day (`\/sc daily`). The target path in the command line points to a non-existing script file. This suggests that the attacker might have tried to execute malicious code but failed, possibly due to typo or incorrect path. However, the fact that they're attempting to run PowerShell with elevated privileges is concerning.\n\nI also see several registry access events from various processes like `svchost.exe`, which can be used to hide malicious activities by integrating into system services. These entries might indicate an attempt to persistence or alter system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry writes (`RegistryEvent`) and file creations involving `.dll` files and task entries. These actions don't seem normal for regular user activity and could be signs of a malware installation trying to establish persistence.\n\nOn the other hand, some events like `winlogbeat.exe` writing a configuration file might just be legitimate log management tools updating their settings. However, the volume of suspicious activities from other processes outweighs this.\n\nPutting it all together, there's evidence suggesting an attempted malicious script execution using PowerShell via scheduled tasks and registry modifications. While not all attempts may have succeeded, the combination of these events raises red flags about potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including attempts to execute PowerShell scripts with elevated privileges, creation of scheduled tasks, and registry modifications suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, I've got five events here, each in JSONL format. My goal is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and decide whether it's worth looking into further.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows that `winlogbeat.exe` created a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`. Winlogbeat is typically used for collecting Windows logs, so this seems normal. It's just creating or updating its configuration file.\n\n2. The second event is from `powershell.exe` creating a file named `entrada_ativo.txt` in the same Downloads folder. PowerShell being used to create files isn't suspicious on its own, but I'll keep an eye out for other actions it might be taking.\n\n3. The third event again involves `powershell.exe`, this time accessing a process. This could mean it's starting another script or interacting with another application. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious, but PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its versatility and built-in commands.\n\n4. The fourth event is the execution of `whoami.exe` from the system32 directory, which is a common utility used to get user information. It's usually harmless, but since it's executed via command line without any unusual parameters, it doesn't raise red flags here.\n\n5. The fifth event again shows `powershell.exe` accessing another process, similar to the third event. Again, this could be part of legitimate activity or something more nefarious.\n\nPutting all these events together, I notice that `powershell.exe` is involved in three out of five events, with two instances where it's creating files and accessing processes. This is a bit concerning because PowerShell can execute commands directly, which makes it a tool often used by attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts.\n\nThe creation of `entrada_ativo.txt` stands out because I'm not immediately sure why that specific file would be created. It might be part of data exfiltration, setting up persistence mechanisms, or something else entirely. Additionally, the combination of creating files and accessing processes could indicate a script being executed to perform multiple tasks.\n\nWhile each individual event might not seem suspicious on its own, the fact that they're all occurring within the same user's Downloads folder and involve multiple actions from PowerShell raises the possibility of malicious activity. There's also the execution of `whoami.exe`, which is often used by attackers to gather information about the current user or system.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, there's enough potential for concern that further investigation would be warranted. The batch doesn't scream \"attack,\" but it does have elements that could indicate something isn't quite right.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple actions involving powershell.exe, including file creation and process access, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
