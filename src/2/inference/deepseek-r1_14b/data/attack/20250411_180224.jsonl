{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're relevant for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe creating tasks with schtasks. The command lines in these processes are trying to execute powershell scripts. However, the script paths mentioned, like NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1, don't exist on the system. This suggests that the script might not be executed properly or intentionally not present, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Svchost.exe is commonly used by legitimate services, but it's also often exploited by malware to hide processes. The fact that it's making several registry changes could indicate an attempt to persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nI notice repeated activities from cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, which are tools often used in command-line attacks. Using these tools to schedule tasks with powershell scripts might be a tactic to maintain access or perform malicious actions over time.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run, which could be used by attackers to check the system's identity and permissions, potentially indicating reconnaissance activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events related to winlogbeat.yml, which is likely part of log shipping or monitoring software. However, considering the other malicious indicators, this might not be relevant unless it's part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple suspicious processes, non-existent scripts, and registry modifications by svchost.exe point towards potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of command-line tools for task scheduling also raises concerns about possible persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe and cmd.exe creating scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts, svchost.exe making registry changes, and repeated use of schtasks.exe. These indicators suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
