{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, multiple entries involve PowerShell and cmd.exe, which are commonly used by attackers. For instance, there's a cmd.exe command that creates a service using sc create with a binPath pointing to a .ps1 script that doesn't exist. This is suspicious because it suggests an attempt to run a non-existent script, possibly to hide malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, several entries show the creation and querying of services (like win32times) via sc.exe. These actions could be part of persistence mechanisms or attempts to create backdoors in the system.\n\nThere are also repeated Registry value sets by various processes, including svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. Unusual registry activity is often a red flag for malware installing itself or modifying system configurations.\n\nLastly, I notice a few events where legitimate processes like calc.exe load urlmon.dll, which might not be inherently malicious but could indicate some form of injection or exploitation if seen in conjunction with other suspicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show signs of potentially malicious behavior, especially the service creation attempts and registry modifications. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe executing commands with potential malicious intent, including creating services with non-existent scripts and unusual Registry activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if the entire collection is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal because it's part of the log management process.\n\nNext, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both setting registry values. Those are standard system processes; they don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe setting a registry value and accessing another process. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. Accessing other processes might indicate malicious activity, so that's something to note.\n\nThere are multiple entries from chrome.exe creating pipes and setting registry values repeatedly. That's a lot of RegistryEvent tasks. While Chrome is a common application, repeated writes could be suspicious if they're not part of its usual operation.\n\nAlso, looking at the files involved: there's an attempt to load amsi.dll, which is related to Microsoft's antivirus scans. An attacker might try to bypass this by exploiting it or injecting malicious code. The other file loaded is from Windows Defender, which could be normal, but combined with other actions, it's worth monitoring.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry writes, chrome.exe doing the same, and the file operations. These activities might be part of a larger campaign or persistence mechanism by an attacker. It's not just one-off events; the repetition and combination make me think something is off.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple signs that could indicate malicious behavior, especially with powershell.exe and the repeated RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe. My confidence is high but not certain, so maybe around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of processes like PowerShell and Chrome showing suspicious activity including registry modifications and process access.
