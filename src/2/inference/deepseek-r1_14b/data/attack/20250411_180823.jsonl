There are nine JSON objects here, each representing a different event.\n\nFirst, I notice that six of them involve 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. While Chrome does update settings sometimes, multiple instances might be suspicious, but not necessarily malicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an event where 'powershell.exe' was accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement, so this could be a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there's a 'whoami.exe' process running without any file path or arguments. Using whoami to gather user information can be part of reconnaissance, which is another concerning sign.\n\nPutting it all together—registry changes, PowerShell access, and whoami execution—it suggests possible malicious activity. This combination increases the risk level beyond just normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving Chrome.exe modifying registry values and a single event of Powershell.exe accessing processes, along with an instance of whoami.exe being executed.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial entries, there are several instances where chrome.exe is making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that does that frequently. But then I notice other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and Calculator.exe appearing in the logs.\n\nOne event catches my attention: cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command is \"\/c calc.exe\", which seems suspicious because it's executing calc.exe from the command prompt. This might be an attempt to run malicious code or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother thing I spot is multiple instances where schtasks.exe is used to create new scheduled tasks. Each task points to cmd.exe and runs calc.exe at startup or logon. This repeated pattern of creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as their trigger is a red flag because it's a common technique for attackers to establish persistence on a system.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and loads images like urlmon.dll. While PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators, the combination of accessing other processes and loading known DLLs could indicate malicious activity, especially when combined with the scheduled tasks created earlier.\n\nThere's also an event where svchost.exe creates files in the Tasks directory. Svchost.exe is typically associated with legitimate Windows services, but it can sometimes be abused by malware to create or modify system files. The fact that multiple events show svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files adds to the suspicion.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated network activity from Chrome, creation of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe pointing to calc.exe, use of cmd.exe with administrative privileges (as seen in the command line), and powershell.exe accessing system processes—these are all indicators that might point towards malicious behavior. It's possible an attacker is setting up persistence mechanisms on the system.\n\nI'm a bit uncertain because some events could be legitimate if these tools are being used by authorized admins, but considering the volume and specific commands (like calc.exe via schtasks), it seems more likely to be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as repeated creation of scheduled tasks pointing to calc.exe using schtasks.exe, which is often used for persistence. Additionally, cmd.exe and powershell.exe are involved in potentially malicious operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything unusual.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process, often associated with services, so this might be normal. But seeing it set registry values repeatedly could be suspicious if done in a short period.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe and conhost.exe also setting registry values.Cmd is a command prompt, which can be used for various legitimate tasks but sometimes by malware too. Conhost.exe is usually related to console windows, so again, not inherently bad, but combined with other activities might raise flags.\n\nPowershell.exe appears twice: once setting a registry value and another accessing a process. Powershell is powerful and often targeted by attackers because it can execute commands and access system information. The fact that one of the events is 'ProcessAccess' on powershell could indicate some form of lateral movement or privilege escalation, which is concerning.\n\nLooking at the files mentioned, most are None except for a couple. One event shows a file being created in the user's Downloads folder with 'winlogbeat.yml.new', which seems like it might be part of an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) setup for log management, so that could be legitimate if someone is setting up monitoring.\n\nAnother file path is 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. The name sounds Portuguese, and 'ativo' means active or alive. The filename might suggest some kind of list or script, but without more context, it's hard to say. If this was created by powershell.exe, that could be a red flag.\n\nI also see multiple instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values and loading various DLLs. While Chrome can interact with the registry for settings and extensions, doing so excessively might indicate some form of browser hijacking or extension abuse.\n\nThe last few events show 'Image loaded' tasks for different DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files related to antivirus and Windows Defender features, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated registry writes by multiple processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe) across various timestamps could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or credential dumping. The creation of files in user directories by these processes adds to the suspicion. While some events are normal, the volume and combination suggest potential compromise.\n\nI'm also thinking about the confidence level. There's a lot here that seems off but not necessarily conclusive. It's possible for legitimate activities to trigger these logs, but given the number of red flags, I'd say there's a high probability this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe) are setting registry values repeatedly. Powershell.exe is involved in file creation and process access, while chrome.exe exhibits unusual registry activity and loads DLLs. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
