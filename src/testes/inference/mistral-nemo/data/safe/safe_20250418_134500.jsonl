{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of events in chronological order:\n\n1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Process Create**\n   - A new instance of Microsoft Edge Update service was created.\n\n2. **Image Loaded (Multiple)**\n   - The process loaded several DLL files from its directory:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\1.3.195.49\\msedgeupdate.dll\n     ```\n\n3. **Process Accessed**\n   - MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe accessed another process.\n\n4. **Network Connection Detected**\n   - The Microsoft Edge Update service established a network connection, likely to check for updates or download files.\n\n5. **Process Terminated (Multiple)**\n   - The Microsoft Edge Update service was terminated multiple times in succession. This could indicate either normal completion of its tasks or forced termination due to an error or issue.\n\n6. **Registry Value Set**\n   - RuntimeBroker.exe set a registry value. This process is typically associated with managing Windows Store apps and their permissions.\n\n7. **File Created**\n   - A new Windows Update log file was created:\n     ```\n     C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.6.etl\n     ```\n\n8. **Process Create (Winlogbeat.exe)**\n   - Winlogbeat, an Elastic stack data shipper, was created. This suggests that some form of logging or monitoring has been set up on the system.\n\n9. **Image Loaded**\n   - winlogbeat.exe loaded its executable file:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\winlogbeat.exe\n     ```\n\n10. **File Created**\n    - Winlogbeat created a new log file in NDJSON format:\n      ```\n      C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson\n      ```\n\nThese logs suggest normal operation of Windows Update service and Edge browser, followed by the setup or initialization of a logging\/monitoring tool (Winlogbeat). However, the multiple terminations of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe might warrant further investigation if they were not intended behavior."}

Depending on the context, this could be normal or warrant further investigation.\n- The creation and modification of setup.exe by MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe is unusual and should be looked into.\n- Lastly, the appearance of winlogbeat.exe might indicate that logging or monitoring tools have been installed on this system.\n\nTo gain more context and assess these potential concerns, you would need to:\n\n- Correlate these events with other logs and activities on the system.\n- Check if the involved processes are digitally signed by trusted publishers.\n- Verify if the actions were performed by authorized users or services.\n- Review the content of created files where possible (e.g., `.yml.new`) to ensure they are legitimate."}
