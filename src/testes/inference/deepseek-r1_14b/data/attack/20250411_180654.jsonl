{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving both Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe. The first event shows that powershell.exe created a file called 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for scripting, which could be malicious if the script isn't approved.\n\nNext, there are several entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. I know that modifying the Windows Registry can be a common tactic for persistence or configuration changes by malware. Doing this multiple times in quick succession might indicate something suspicious, but it's also possible that legitimate software does this during installation or updates.\n\nThen, I see an entry where whoami.exe was run. That tool is typically used to determine user information, which isn't inherently malicious but can be part of a reconnaissance phase by attackers to gather system details.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that reference various script paths ending in Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that the same script name appears repeatedly suggests this might be an attempt to log keystrokes or capture sensitive information, which is definitely a red flag. Additionally, these scripts are using $env:TEMP as the LogPath, meaning they're writing logs to a temporary directory, which is common for avoiding detection.\n\nThe later entries show that PowerShell.exe is loading several DLLs related to .NET Framework andclrjit.dll. While this might seem normal, sometimes attackers load malicious modules or use these frameworks for obfuscation or payload execution.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity: repeated script executions with known names associated with keylogging, creation of temporary files, registry modifications which could be persistence mechanisms, and using legitimate tools like PowerShell and Chrome in a way that's not typical user behavior. The combination of these events increases the suspicion level.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any benign explanation for this activity. For example, a user running multiple scripts or installing software could cause some of these logs. But given the specific script names (Get-Keystrokes) and repeated patterns, it seems more likely to be malicious or at least suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because there are several red flags that collectively suggest potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell executing scripts named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', which are often associated with keylogging or other malicious activities. Additionally, repeated registry modifications and file creation by Chrome.exe may indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is executing scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. These scripts often log keystrokes, which can be malicious, so that's a red flag.\n\nThere are several instances where these PowerShell commands create temporary files in the user's AppData directory, especially paths like $env:TEMP\\\\key.log. Temporary files created by scripts can indicate suspicious activity.\n\nI also see multiple FileCreate events from powershell.exe creating different log files and other text files in various locations, including Downloads and Temp folders. This could be part of a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration.\n\nAdditionally, there are Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can allow malicious actors to maintain access or alter system behavior.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of similar command lines with slight path variations suggests an attempt to avoid detection by changing file locations each time. This pattern is common in malware to evade signature-based detection.\n\nWhile some events like FileLoad from Windows Defender components are normal, the overall combination points towards potential malicious activities. The use of PowerShell for script execution, creation of log files, and registry modifications without clear benign justification makes this batch concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing scripts with keystroke logging functionality, creating temporary files, and modifying the registry suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
