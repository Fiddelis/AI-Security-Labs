{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome is a browser that frequently connects to the internet and performs DNS lookups. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I notice RuntimeBroker.exe making changes to the registry. Runtime Broker is part of Windows and handles various tasks, so registry modifications here are expected and not unusual.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe accessing the registry. Notepad is a simple text editor; it shouldn't be doing much with the registry unless it's part of some script or malicious activity. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nPowershell.exe shows up a few times, both in process creation and accessing other processes. PowerShell can be used for legitimate scripting but is also commonly abused by attackers for command execution. This could be a red flag, especially if combined with other activities.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll sounds odd. Normally, Calculator wouldn't load such a DLL unless there's some malicious activity or if it's being used as part of a larger script to hide operations.\n\nLooking at cmd.exe entries, one stands out because it's using schtasks to create new tasks on startup and logon. The command lines show that they're running calc.exe. This is concerning because creating scheduled tasks via command line can be a tactic for persistence. If these tasks are set to run at startup or logon, an attacker could maintain access to the system.\n\nSchtasks.exe appears multiple times with specific task creation commands pointing to cmd.exe and calc.exe. Schtasks is legitimate but its misuse can indicate malicious activity, especially when combined with other suspicious processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe.\n\nSVCHost.exe is known for hosting various Windows services, so some registry writes aren't unusual. However, seeing it create files in the Task directory could be a sign of unauthorized task creation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nConhost.exe also accesses the registry, which might not be suspicious on its own, but when combined with other events, it could raise questions.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe creating persistent tasks that execute calc.exe is concerning. The use of powershell.exe adds to this suspicion as it's a common tool for attackers. Additionally, the repeated registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe might be part of setting up a persistence mechanism or installing malware.\n\nThe events seem to indicate potential command-line based malicious activities trying to establish persistence on the system. This could be an attempt at creating backdoors or ensuring that certain processes run at specific times, which is typical in APTs or ransomware attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious process creations and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity. PowerShell and cmd.exe are used to create scheduled tasks executing calc.exe, indicating possible persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and especially powershell.exe. Notably, one of the powershell.exe events has a 'File created' task where it creates a file named unidade_ativo.txt in a user's Downloads folder. That seems suspicious because creating files can be part of malicious activities.\n\nThen there are several instances of chrome.exe performing registry value sets and image loads. While Chrome is legitimate, multiple registry modifications could indicate something is amiss, especially if they're happening rapidly or in an unusual pattern.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process being created, which is often used by attackers to check user permissions. The command line seems normal here, but combined with other events, it might raise flags.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple writes to the registry from various processes, file creation by PowerShell, and usage of whoami.exe. These activities together could be indicative of a potential attack, such as persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm not entirely certain because some actions could be benign, but considering the combination, there's enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including file creation by powershell.exe and process creations that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
