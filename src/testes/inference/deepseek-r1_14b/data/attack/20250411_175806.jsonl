{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that might be a red flag. But sometimes it's just normal usage. Then there's whoami.exe running, which is usually harmless as it's used to get user information. \n\nNext, another powershell.exe access, same as the first one. Then, I see cmd.exe being used with a command line that adds something to the Run registry key. That's suspicious because adding entries there can allow programs to run at startup, which could be part of persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nThere are multiple instances where different processes (cmd.exe, reg.exe) are modifying the registry. This is concerning because unauthorized changes to the registry can indicate malicious activity. Also, I notice that 'modulo_padrao.txt' is being created by powershell.exe. Creating files, especially with names like .txt, could be part of data exfiltration or setting up scripts.\n\nLooking further, winlogbeat.exe creates some configuration file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log management, so that might not be an issue unless it's used inappropriately here.\n\nPutting this together: multiple use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry modifications suggests potential malicious activity. The creation of files by these processes could indicate they're setting up components or scripts on the system. The repeated access to powershell and registry changes make me think this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, cmd.exe modifying the registry for potential persistence, and file creation activities that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
