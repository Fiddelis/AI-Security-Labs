{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of events. I'll go through each one and see if anything stands out as suspicious.\n\nThe first event is whoami.exe being run normally—nothing unusual there. Then, powershell.exe starts appearing multiple times with different log tasks. Noticing that powershell.exe is accessing the registry and creating files. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously, but it's also commonly used for legitimate admin tasks.\n\nLooking closer, one of the events shows powershell.exe executing a command line with \"findstr\" searching for 'pass' in various file extensions. That looks like it's trying to search for sensitive information, which could indicate data exfiltration or recon. Also, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating and then deleting temporary files, which might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks without any associated file info. This seems unusual and possibly part of a larger script execution, maybe using event providers in a way that's not typical.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll and other .NET files, which might be normal if running scripts, but combined with the other actions, it adds to the suspicion. The creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1 suggest a script was run temporarily, perhaps testing something.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing the registry is odd too—maybe modifying system settings in an unusual way. Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal but could be part of malicious activities if combined with other actions.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious commands and file operations raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The confidence level isn't super high because some actions could be legitimate, but the combination points towards possible investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potentially malicious behavior in PowerShell, including searching for sensitive information and temporary file creation\/deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. There are 40 entries here, each with process, winlog, and file information. I need to analyze all of them together to see if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning through the processes mentioned. I notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times, which immediately catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for malicious activity. The command lines in some entries look suspicious—like using findstr and select-string with patterns related to 'pass' in various file types (xml, doc, txt, xls). This could indicate someone searching for sensitive information or trying to extract credentials.\n\nLooking deeper, I see that svchost.exe is also appearing several times. While svchost is a common system process, it's known to be used by malware to hide malicious activities under the guise of legitimate services. The multiple Registry value sets might be an attempt to maintain persistence or modify system configurations in a way that could facilitate unauthorized access.\n\nThere are entries where Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll, which seems normal, but I'm keeping an eye out for any unusual file accesses or network connections. However, in this case, it doesn't seem suspicious beyond the standard operation of the program.\n\nAnother point is the repeated Registry value sets across various processes like OfficeClickToRun.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. Malware often manipulates the registry to ensure persistence across reboots or to alter system behavior subtly. The frequency here might indicate an attempt to make changes that could go unnoticed, but without more context on what exactly was changed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nI also notice several Dns query events from chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe. While legitimate applications perform DNS queries all the time, frequent or unusual queries can sometimes be a sign of malicious activity like domain generation algorithms used in botnets. However, since these are standard applications, it might not be cause for immediate concern unless there's an anomaly in the query patterns.\n\nThe file paths mentioned don't immediately raise red flags. For example,MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, and urlmon.dll is a legitimate system component. The only file created by powershell.exe seems to be related to PowerShell's own configuration, which could be normal or could be an attempt to hide malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags here: suspicious PowerShell commands, svchost.exe activity, multiple Registry modifications, and repeated process names that could indicate a campaign trying to remain undetected. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior, even if individual actions aren't overtly suspicious on their own. The combination points towards possible unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch of logs as requiring further investigation. Security teams should look into the exact commands run by PowerShell, check for any unexpected registry changes, and monitor for unusual network activity from these processes.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are present with command lines that include `findstr` and `select-string` looking for 'pass' in various file types. This could indicate credential harvesting or data extraction.\n\n2. **Analyze svchost.exe Activity:**\n   - The frequent appearance of `svchost.exe` alongside registry modifications suggests potential malware activity, as svchost is commonly used by malicious actors to hide their processes.\n\n3. **Examine Registry Modifications:**\n   - Several entries show registry value sets across different legitimate-sounding processes. This could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system settings for malicious purposes.\n\n4. **Monitor DNS Queries:**\n   - Although `chrome.exe` and other benign processes perform DNS queries, the frequency might warrant closer inspection to rule out botnet-like behavior or command-and-control communication.\n\n5. **Assess File Operations:**\n   - The creation of a `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file by `winlogbeat.exe` seems legitimate but could be checked for any anomalies in file content or access patterns.\n\n6. **Evaluate Overall Pattern:**\n   - Combining all observations, the logs show signs that could indicate an attack vector using known tools and processes to remain stealthy. This pattern suggests a potential security incident requiring deeper investigation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of log entries exhibits several indicators that may point towards malicious activity, such as suspicious PowerShell commands, svchost.exe anomalies, and multiple registry modifications. These factors together suggest the need for further analysis to determine if a cybersecurity incident has occurred."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down what I see.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe performing various tasks like loading images, accessing the registry, and establishing network connections. While these activities seem normal for a browser, the frequency might be worth noting—especially if Chrome isn't typically used heavily on this system. However, without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nNext, I notice several file creation events from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. Creating files named 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt' doesn't immediately raise a red flag, but the naming suggests some sort of structured data or logic object, which could be part of malicious activity like credential dumping or creating persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, there are instances where cmd.exe is used with command lines that delete scheduled tasks. The commands in cmd.exe's command line parameter indicate deletion of specific task names, which might be an attempt to remove traces of previous activities or prevent certain actions from running at startup or logon. This behavior could be part of a cleanup routine by malware to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also entries where schtasks.exe is used to create processes. SchTasks is another tool often associated with legitimate system administration but can also be abused to schedule malicious tasks for persistence. The task names like \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" seem arbitrary, which might not align with standard naming conventions, suggesting possible misuse.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. This tool is typically used to determine user permissions and could be part of reconnaissance by attackers to understand the current user context, aiding in privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files might be related to log shipping or monitoring tools, which are legitimate, but if this process is running outside its usual scope or with unexpected permissions, it could warrant closer inspection.\n\nLastly, svchost.exe accessing registry events isn't unusual since it's a common system process, but any changes here should be monitored for potential tampering with system services or configurations.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, the combination of using powershell and cmd to create files, delete tasks, and run scripts, along with the use of schtasks and whoami, raises concerns about possible malicious activities. However, without additional context like timestamps, user accounts involved, or baseline behavior data, it's challenging to definitively label these as attacks. They do present enough indicators that could point towards potential threats, making this batch of logs worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several behaviors that are noteworthy from a cybersecurity standpoint:\n\n1. **Chrome.exe Activity**: Multiple entries show Chrome performing normal operations like image loading and registry access. While not inherently suspicious, the frequency might warrant monitoring if Chrome isn't typically used extensively.\n\n2. **PowerShell File Creation**: Powershell creates files with non-standard names, which could indicate malicious scripting activities such as credential dumping or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Cmd.exe Command-Line Activities**: Commands deleting specific scheduled tasks suggest potential cleanup routines to avoid detection, a common tactic in malware.\n\n4. **Schtasks.exe Use**: Schtasks is used to create processes, possibly for scheduling malicious tasks, given the arbitrary task names which don't align with standard conventions.\n\n5. **Whoami.exe Execution**: This tool's use could be part of reconnaissance efforts by attackers to understand user permissions and context.\n\n6. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity**: Likely related to log monitoring but could warrant inspection if running outside its usual scope.\n\n7. **Svchost.exe Registry Access**: Common system process, but changes here should be monitored for potential tampering.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of activities involving powershell, cmd, schtasks, and whoami raises concerns about possible malicious intent. While not conclusive without additional context, these indicators suggest potential threats that merit further investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing an event. Each event has three main components: process information, winlog (Windows log), and file details.\n\nLooking at the first event, it involves 'schtasks.exe' being used to delete a task named \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". Schtasks is commonly used for scheduling tasks in Windows, but deleting a task could be part of malicious activity if it's trying to remove evidence or disable security features. However, sometimes legitimate scripts also manage scheduled tasks, so this alone might not be conclusive.\n\nThe next events show 'schtasks.exe' loading the taskschd.dll file. That seems normal as schtasks relies on that DLL for functionality, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there's an event with 'svchost.exe' and a registry change. Svchost is a common process used by many services, including some malicious ones. Registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. This might warrant closer look but isn't definitive on its own.\n\nSeveral events involve 'cmd.exe' being executed with specific commands. For example, one command uses wmic to delete the 'notepad.exe' process, which is unusual because notepad is a standard application. Deleting processes via WMIC could be an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt normal operations. Another cmd.exe command deletes a user named \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\", and another deletes \"componente_comum_Admin\". These look like they're deleting user accounts, possibly administrative ones. Unusual deletions of users, especially if done without proper authorization, could indicate privilege escalation or attempts to remove evidence.\n\nThere are multiple events with 'powershell.exe' being accessed and modifying the registry. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for various malicious activities, including lateral movement, credential dumping, and persistence. The fact that it's accessing and modifying the registry several times might be concerning, as registry changes can be part of installing malware or altering system configurations.\n\nThen there are events with 'whoami.exe', which typically retrieves user information. Seeing this executed in the context of other suspicious activities could indicate reconnaissance to gather system information for later attacks.\n\nThe use of 'WMIC.exe' stands out because it's being used with commands to delete processes and load various DLLs. WMIC is a tool for managing Windows systems remotely, but its legitimate use can also mask malicious activities like process termination or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the file paths loaded by these processes: taskschd.dll, urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll are all legitimate system files, so that doesn't immediately raise red flags. However, the combination of multiple registry modifications, user deletions, process terminations, and use of tools like schtasks, cmd.exe with WMIC, powershell, and whoami could indicate a coordinated attack.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show several signs of potential malicious activity: deleting scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, deleting user accounts, terminating processes, and using powerful tools like Powershell and WMIC. These actions are often part of an attacker's toolkit for persistence, privilege escalation, and covering tracks. While each individual event might not be conclusive on its own, the pattern suggests a possible security incident that merits deeper investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation:\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Deletion**: The use of `schtasks.exe` to delete a task named \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\" could be an attempt to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple events show registry changes via processes like `svchost.exe` and `powershell.exe`, which are often used in persistence mechanisms by attackers.\n\n3. **User Account Deletions**: Commands using `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` delete administrative user accounts, which might indicate privilege escalation or attempts to remove traces of prior activities.\n\n4. **Process Termination**: Use of `WMIC.exe` to terminate processes, including `notepad.exe`, suggests potential efforts to disrupt normal operations or cover tracks.\n\n5. **PowerShell Activity**: Numerous events show Powershell accessing and modifying the registry, a common vector for malicious activities such as credential dumping and persistence.\n\n6. **Reconnaissance Tools**: Execution of `whoami.exe` might indicate an attacker gathering system information for further attacks.\n\n7. **Unusual Command-Line Activities**: The combination of commands using tools like `schtasks`, `cmd.exe` with WMIC, Powershell, and others suggests a coordinated attack strategy typical in cyberattacks.\n\n**Conclusion**: These events collectively suggest potential malicious activity, including possible compromise attempts, persistence mechanisms, or evidence deletion. Further investigation is recommended to assess the extent of any breach and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. There are multiple entries here, each containing information about processes and Windows logs.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where PowerShell.exe is being accessed but without any file activity. This might be concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting malicious activities. The repeated 'Process accessed' tasks could indicate someone trying to establish persistence or move laterally within the system.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple commands using cmd.exe and net.exe with specific user deletion commands like '\/del \/domain'. These commands suggest an attempt to delete user accounts, which is a red flag. Deleting user accounts can be part of an attacker's strategy to cover their tracks or disrupt legitimate users.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where services.exe and sc.exe are used. The command 'sc delete win32times' stands out because it's attempting to remove a service from the system. This could be another attempt to disable monitoring tools or services that might detect malicious activities.\n\nThe combination of these events—accessing PowerShell without files, deleting users, and modifying services—creates a concerning pattern. These actions don't seem like normal user behavior and align with tactics used in cyberattacks, such as privilege escalation, persistence, and system disruption.\n\nMoreover, the repetitive nature of these commands suggests a possible script or automated tool being used, which is common in attacks to carry out multiple malicious tasks without human intervention.\n\nGiven all these points, it's clear that this batch of logs indicates potential malicious activity. The confidence level here is high because several red flags are present together, making it more likely than not that investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of suspicious process creations and registry modifications, including attempts to delete user accounts and system services using cmd.exe and powershell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm supposed to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nStarting off, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Both of these are common tools used by attackers for command execution and persistence. Powershell is particularly notorious because it can execute scripts and has legitimate uses, making it hard to detect malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged:\n\n1. There are several Registry value sets from both cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.\n2. File deletions occur with cmd.exe deleting temporary files in the user's temp directory. This could indicate an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity.\n3. The use of whoami.exe might be to gather system information, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n4. There are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET and Windows DLLs, which is normal but sometimes can hide malicious activity if the modules are loaded from unexpected paths.\n5. File creation and deletion events in the Temp directory with PowerShell scripts could be part of script execution or testing for policy bypass.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows a sequence of activities that could be indicative of malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few lines, I see a lot of powershell.exe processes being created and accessing other processes. For example, there's a 'Process Create' task with powershell.exe as the process name. That's already a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be a vector for malicious activities.\n\nThen, in another event, powershell.exe accesses a file path: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. This seems like it's interacting with Windows Defender components. I wonder if this is normal or if there could be something suspicious here.\n\nThere are multiple instances where powershell.exe creates files in the user's AppData directory, which might indicate persistence mechanisms since attackers often use such locations to store malicious scripts or configurations. For example, one event shows a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive.\n\nAdditionally, there are several 'Registry value set' events from different processes like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe is being executed multiple times with the command line pointing directly to its path. While whoami is a legitimate tool, repeated executions without clear context might indicate credential dumping or information gathering.\n\nOther events involve processes like winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which doesn't seem immediately suspicious but could be part of normal operations.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell instances interacting with system components, creating files in user directories, modifying registry entries, and executing other utilities like whoami. These activities, while not necessarily all malicious on their own, collectively raise red flags about potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior. The repeated use of powershell.exe accessing various parts of the system is a strong indicator that this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe interacting with system components, creating files in user directories, and modifying registry entries.

Let's break down each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That makes sense since it's part of the logging process itself, probably setting up or updating its configuration file. Not a red flag.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so access alone isn't suspicious unless there's unusual activity. Here, it's just an access event, no indication of malicious commands.\n\nThen, whoami.exe running. This is typically benign; users or scripts might use it to check permissions or user info. No signs of anything wrong here.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access event. Again, without more context like command lines or other indicators, this doesn't raise alarms.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both modifying registry values. These are standard system processes that often interact with the registry for configuration. Nothing unusual about their activity here.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events: three DNS queries and four network connections. Browsers naturally make DNS requests to resolve domain names and establish connections, especially if they're handling multiple tabs or extensions. The frequency seems normal; no signs of unexpected domains or excessive data usage.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, there's a mix of common userland processes performing typical actions. No events indicate unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or anomalies that would warrant deeper investigation.
