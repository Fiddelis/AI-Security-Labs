{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those seem normal. Browsers and system processes often do DNS lookups and network connections. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nBut then I see a lot of cmd.exe and net.exe commands. Wait, there's a command line that adds a user called \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to the domain. Then another command adds \"elemento_comum_Admin\" to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Adding users to Domain Admins is a high-privilege action. The passwords look like they might be temporary, but the fact that these commands are being run suggests someone is trying to escalate privileges or set up access.\n\nAlso, there's a \"net1.exe\" which is probably a typo or a malicious version of net.exe. The command lines here are similar, adding more users and groups. That's concerning. Then, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities. Modifying registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the file creation events: winlogbeat.exe creates a .yml.new file, which might be part of configuration changes. Powershell.exe creates a \"pacote_base.txt\" file. Not sure what's in there, but combined with the other activities, it could be part of an attack. The svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log files is normal, as that's related to system resource usage tracking.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple user additions to Domain Admins, use of cmd.exe and net.exe for these actions, PowerShell activities, and file creations might indicate an attempt to compromise the system, escalate privileges, and establish persistence. The confidence here is high because these actions are typically associated with malicious activities, especially the domain admin additions and registry modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including adding users to Domain Admins group, executing commands to create domain users with complex passwords, and modifying registry values via PowerShell. These actions are indicative of privilege escalation and potential system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
