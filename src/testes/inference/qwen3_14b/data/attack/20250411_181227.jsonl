{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, looking at the process entries, there are several instances where PowerShell is being used with command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction, New-ScheduledTaskTrigger, and Register-ScheduledTask. The scheduled tasks are set to execute calc.exe, which is a common tool used in benign scenarios but can also be a red flag if it's part of a larger malicious payload. However, just using calc.exe isn't necessarily bad, but the way it's being scheduled here might be suspicious.\n\nThe triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to the Administrators group with the highest run level. That's a bit concerning because running tasks with administrative privileges can be a sign of someone trying to escalate privileges or execute commands with higher permissions. Also, the fact that multiple scheduled tasks are being created with different names (like unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.) might indicate an attempt to create multiple backdoors or persistent access points on the system.\n\nThen there are other events related to PowerShell, such as registry value sets and process accesses. These could be part of normal operations, but combined with the scheduled tasks, they might suggest that the attacker is modifying system settings or trying to maintain persistence. The image loaded events include .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate files, but their presence could be part of a more complex attack, especially if they're being loaded in an unusual context.\n\nHowever, there's also a chrome.exe process with pipe created and registry events. Since Chrome is a common browser, these might be normal activities, but without more context, it's hard to say. The key here is the repeated use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, which is a classic technique used in many attacks to maintain access.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious files or processes. The image loaded events for PowerShell include .NET components, which are standard for PowerShell, so that's not necessarily bad. But the combination of creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and modifying the registry could be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, the main red flags are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with administrative rights, the use of PowerShell for these tasks, and the possibility of persistence mechanisms being set up. Even though some elements are normal, the combination and frequency of these events make them suspicious. Therefore, this seems like a case worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs indicate **potentially malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Malicious Use of PowerShell for Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands to **create scheduled tasks** with the following characteristics:\n     - **Execution of `calc.exe`**: While benign alone, this is often a red flag in malicious contexts (e.g., a placeholder for more harmful payloads).\n     - **Triggered at Logon**: Indicates an attempt to **establish persistence**.\n     - **Administrative Privileges**: The tasks are configured to run under the **`BUILTIN\\Administrators` group with \"Highest Available\" privileges**, suggesting **privilege escalation** or **unauthorized access**.\n\n   Example command:\n   ```powershell\n   Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action (New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\") -Trigger (New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon) -Principal (New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -RunLevel Highest)\n   ```\n\n2. **Unusual Frequency of Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple tasks are created with unique names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`, `tarefa_geral`), which could indicate **attempts to establish multiple backdoors** or **obfuscate malicious activity**.\n\n3. **Loading of .NET Assemblies**:\n   - PowerShell is loading .NET components like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscorlib.ni.dll`. While these are legitimate, their presence here may indicate **code injection** or **exploitation of .NET-based vulnerabilities** (e.g., via PowerShell remoting or malicious scripts).\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access Events**:\n   - Frequent **registry modifications** and **process access** events (e.g., `ProcessCreate`, `ProcessAccess`, `ImageLoad`) suggest **system tampering** or **malware persistence mechanisms**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Analysis**\n- **PowerShell as a Vector**: The use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks is a **common technique in post-exploitation phases** of attacks (e.g., in the **\"Initial Access\"** and **\"Persistence\"** stages of the MITRE ATT&CK framework).\n- **Lack of Legitimate Purpose**: The tasks execute `calc.exe` (a harmless utility) but with elevated privileges. This could be a **spearheaded attempt to test access** or a **staging ground for further attacks**.\n- **Possible Evasion**: The use of `.ni.dll` (native image assemblies) might be an attempt to **evade detection** by obfuscating the payload.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Source of PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Check for **unauthorized user accounts** or **compromised credentials** that could have executed these tasks.\n   - Review **Windows Event Logs** for `Event ID 4688` (Process Creation) to trace the origin of the PowerShell processes.\n\n2. **Analyze the Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Inspect the **task actions** (e.g., `calc.exe`) and **triggers** for anomalies.\n   - Use tools like **`schtasks \/query \/fo LIST`** to list all scheduled tasks and their configurations.\n\n3. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Perform a **full system scan** using updated antivirus\/EDR tools to detect **malicious payloads** or **exploits**.\n   - Check for **unusual network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs).\n\n4. **Audit .NET and PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Monitor **PowerShell script execution** (e.g., via `Group Policy` or `AppLocker`) to prevent unauthorized scripts.\n   - Disable **unrestricted use of PowerShell** if not required.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malicious activity** involving **PowerShell-based persistence mechanisms** and **privilege escalation**. Immediate investigation is required to determine the **scope of compromise** and **mitigate risks**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal, but then there's a file created in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's a red flag. Why create and delete a script so quickly? It could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might be part of a malicious activity. Then, looking at the command line for a powershell.exe process, there's a scheduled task being created to run calc.exe with high privileges for the Administrators group. That's definitely suspicious. Creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be a way to maintain persistence or execute commands with elevated rights.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. However, chrome.exe usually doesn't modify the registry, so that might be a sign of a compromised process or a malware masquerading as chrome. But since there are multiple instances, maybe it's a false positive or a legitimate application, but it's something to note.\n\nThe next set of entries has \"None\" for the process and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's a big red flag. If there are multiple events where the process is not identified but a remote command is executed, that could indicate a remote access tool or a command and control communication. However, the process field is \"None\" here, which might be a data collection issue, but the task itself is concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation and deletion of a temp script, scheduled tasks with high privileges, and multiple remote command executions are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some entries might be benign (like the Windows Defender DLL), the combination of these events suggests that someone is trying to execute commands, create persistence, and possibly evade detection by cleaning up logs. The confidence here would be high because multiple suspicious activities are present and combined in a way that's typical of attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"indicator\": \"Suspicious PowerShell script creation and deletion\",\n      \"description\": \"A temporary PowerShell script (unidade_comum.ps1) was created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory, suggesting potential malicious activity or evasion techniques.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"indicator\": \"Scheduled task with elevated privileges\",\n      \"description\": \"A PowerShell command creates a scheduled task to execute calc.exe with high privileges for the BUILTIN\\\\Administrators group, indicating potential persistence mechanism or privilege escalation attempt.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"indicator\": \"Unusual process activity\",\n      \"description\": \"Multiple entries show chrome.exe modifying registry values, which is atypical behavior for a legitimate browser process and may indicate process compromise or malware activity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"indicator\": \"Remote command execution indicators\",\n      \"description\": \"18 entries show 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, suggesting potential command-and-control activity or remote access tool usage.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"risk_assessment\": \"High\",\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Investigate the PowerShell script creation\/deletion pattern for potential malicious payload execution\",\n    \"Audit scheduled tasks for unauthorized entries with elevated privileges\",\n    \"Analyze chrome.exe process behavior for signs of compromise\",\n    \"Investigate remote command execution events for potential C2 communication\"\n  ],\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first event is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses WMI for persistence. However, just one event might not be enough.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process, and registry changes can be normal, but repeated changes might indicate something. But again, not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a File created event for a PowerShell script in the user's AppData directory. That's a red flag because attackers often use AppData for storing malicious scripts. Also, there's a file created in Downloads, which could be benign, but combined with other events, it might be part of an attack.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries are mostly registry changes and loading DLLs. Some of the DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are from Windows Defender, which is normal. But Chrome doing a lot of registry changes could be suspicious, though Chrome itself is a legitimate app.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe events are about creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating files might be part of its normal operation, but if it's doing it in a user's Downloads, maybe not standard. However, the file paths look like they could be part of a setup or configuration.\n\nThe repeated registry events from Chrome and svchost might be part of normal operations, but combined with the PowerShell script creation and the remote command execution attempts (from the 'Execute a Remote Command' events), this could indicate an attack. The PowerShell script in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be used to execute commands automatically.\n\nAlso, the 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no process specified could be a sign of something malicious, like a remote exploit or a command being executed without a clear parent process, which is suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes, file creations in suspicious directories, and remote command executions. While some events are normal, the combination of these might indicate an attempt to compromise the system. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of PowerShell scripts in AppData and the remote command executions are concerning enough to flag this as potentially malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **PowerShell Script Creation in AppData**:\n   - A file named `entrada_principal.txt` and `objeto_auxiliar.txt` was created in the user's Downloads directory, and a script in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (AppData) was generated. This is a **common tactic** for attackers to execute malicious payloads or persist on the system.\n\n2. **Remote Command Execution**:\n   - Multiple entries under the **\"Execute a Remote Command\"** rule (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` creating files) suggest **potential remote interaction**. This could indicate a **compromise via remote access tools** (e.g., RDP, SSH, or exploit-based access).\n\n3. **Unusual Registry Modifications**:\n   - Frequent **registry changes** by `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`) are **abnormal**. While registry edits are common, the volume and context here may point to **malware persistence** or **configuration tampering**.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in the Downloads directory is **unusual**. Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper, but this could indicate **misconfigured or malicious use** (e.g., tampering with log collection settings).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **WmiPrvSE.exe loading `taskschd.dll`**: This is a **normal process** for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), often used for system management tasks.\n- **Chrome.exe and svchost.exe activity**: These processes are **legitimate** but may be exploited by malware. The loaded DLLs (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are part of Windows Defender, which is expected.\n- **File creation in Downloads**: While `entrada_principal.txt` and `objeto_auxiliar.txt` could be benign, their creation via PowerShell raises **contextual concerns**.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Likelihood of Compromise**: **Moderate to High**. The combination of **remote command execution**, **PowerShell script creation**, and **unusual registry edits** suggests a potential **attack chain** (e.g., initial access → persistence → data exfiltration).\n- **Recommendations**:\n  1. **Investigate the PowerShell scripts** (`entrada_principal.txt`, `objeto_auxiliar.txt`) for malicious content (e.g., encoded commands, network connections).\n  2. **Check the registry keys** modified by `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` for unauthorized entries.\n  3. **Audit Winlogbeat configuration** to ensure `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is not part of a malicious setup.\n  4. **Monitor network traffic** from `chrome.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` for exfiltration or C2 activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is legitimate, the **presence of remote command execution, PowerShell script creation, and anomalous registry edits** warrants further investigation. This could indicate a **compromise** or **malicious configuration**. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate risks."}
