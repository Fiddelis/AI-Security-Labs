The tasks are being created with SYSTEM privileges and executed on logon\/startup. Multiple registry events and file creations from svchost.exe and file creations are also present. These activities, while individually potentially benign, collectively suggest possible malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or automated task execution. The repeated usage of calc.exe within these tasks is a potential obfuscation technique.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
