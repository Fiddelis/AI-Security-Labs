{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data shows a series of events happening on a Windows system. Let's break down the key observations and potential implications.\n\n**1. Initial Suspicious Activity (Early Logs):**\n\n*   **File Deletion\/Modification (Initial Log):** The first log item indicates a critical event: a file has been deleted or modified. The path included `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32`. **This is a huge red flag.**  Any alteration to system files in this location is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It strongly suggests a compromise.\n*   **Process Creation:** A process `services.exe` is running, potentially trying to make changes.\n*   **Image Loading**: The `sppsvc.exe` process is loading `taskschd.dll` suggesting scheduled tasks may be involved in malicious activity.\n\n**2. Powershell and Service Creation (Repeated Events):**\n\n*   **Repeated Powershell Commands:** There are multiple log entries showing `powershell.exe` being invoked. This is consistently creating and starting a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n    *   **Service Creation:**  `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"` This command creates a new Windows service. The key here is the path to the executable: `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This is *not* a standard Windows system path. It suggests the attacker is placing malicious executables in a non-standard location. This points to an attacker attempting to hide their code.\n    *   **Service Startup:** `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"` This command starts the newly created service.\n\n**3.  Analysis and Interpretation**\n\n* **Malware Installation:** The pattern strongly indicates an attempt to install malware on the system. The use of PowerShell to create and start a hidden service, combined with the suspicious file path for the service executable, is a classic tactic of attackers.\n* **Persistence:** Creating a Windows service is a way for malware to achieve persistence.  Services automatically start when the system boots, ensuring that the malware continues to run even if the user reboots.\n* **File Modification\/Deletion and Malware:** The initial file deletion\/modification alongside the repeated PowerShell executions to create a service demonstrates likely simultaneous malicious actions. The file modification might be part of an attempt to disable security features, inject malicious code, or cover tracks.\n* **Obfuscation:** The use of non-standard paths (`C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`) suggests the attacker is trying to hide the location of the malicious executable, making it harder to detect.\n* **Potential Functionality:** Without further analysis of `tarefa_logico.exe`, it's impossible to know exactly what the service does. It could be a keylogger, a backdoor, a remote access trojan (RAT), or something else entirely.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Isolation:** Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of the malware.\n2.  **Forensic Investigation:** Perform a thorough forensic investigation of the system to determine:\n    *   The original point of entry (how did the initial malicious file get on the system?).\n    *   The full extent of the compromise (what other systems or data may have been affected?).\n    *   The purpose of the malicious service `objeto_ativo`.\n3.  **Malware Removal:** Use a reputable anti-malware tool (or preferably, have a security professional do so) to remove the malware from the system.\n4.  **System Restoration:** Consider restoring the system from a known-good backup, if available.  Rebuilding the system is often the safest option.\n5.  **Security Hardening:** Review and strengthen your organization's security posture to prevent future incidents. This includes:\n    *   Implementing application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized software from running.\n    *   Improving endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities.\n    *   Training users to identify and avoid phishing attacks.\n6.  **File Scan:**  Scan all other systems on the network for traces of the malicious file.\n7.  **Review Powershell Execution Policies:** Tighten Powershell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n\n**Important Note:** The information in this analysis is based solely on the provided log data.  A comprehensive investigation would require more data, including network traffic logs, memory dumps, and other forensic artifacts."}
