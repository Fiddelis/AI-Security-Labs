{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log data describes a series of PowerShell executions and related activity. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, along with potential areas of concern:\n\n**1. Initial PowerShell Execution & File Removal:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` & `Remove-Item`:** A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) executes a command to remove a file located at `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`. This is highly suspicious.  The script name `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` suggests an attempt to circumvent PowerShell execution policy. The rapid deletion of the script file strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\n**2. PowerShell Activities & Dependencies:**\n\n*   **Multiple `powershell.exe` entries:** The log shows multiple `powershell.exe` processes.  This is normal for scripting and automation, but the sequence of events here is crucial.\n*   **DLL Loading:** The PowerShell process loaded several .NET Framework and .NET modules (mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, System.Management.Automation.ni.dll). This is standard for PowerShell, as it relies on the .NET framework.\n*   **Windows Defender module load:** The load of `MpOAV.dll` which is a Windows Defender module is a normal part of the PowerShell process, although it might also be used to mask malicious behavior.\n\n**3. Registry Modification:**\n\n*   **`services.exe` and Registry:** `services.exe` modifies a registry value. While services do manipulate the registry, this event needs further investigation.\n\n**4. Suspicious Script Name & File Deletion Strategy:**\n\n*   **`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:** The script name is unusual and strongly indicates a test or attempt to bypass PowerShell execution policy restrictions.  The \"PolicyTest\" part is a clear giveaway.\n*   **Rapid Deletion:** The immediate deletion of the script file after it's created is a tactic used by attackers to quickly remove traces of their activities.\n\n**Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **File Path:** `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` –  This is a key indicator and should be flagged.\n*   **Script Name Pattern:**  `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` –  This pattern suggests a targeted attack to bypass security measures.\n*   **Rapid File Deletion:**  This behavior is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Containment:**\n    *   **Isolate the Affected System:**  Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further propagation.\n    *   **Check other Systems:** Scan other machines on the network for similar activity.\n2.  **Malware Scan:** Perform a thorough malware scan on the affected system using updated antivirus and anti-malware tools.\n3.  **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a forensic analysis of the system to determine the scope of the attack, identify the attacker's entry point, and recover any lost data.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:**  Examine and tighten PowerShell execution policy to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n5.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Integration:** Implement an EDR solution to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.\n6.  **Log Review:** Continuously review security logs for suspicious activity.\n7.  **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening suspicious files or clicking on unknown links.\n8.  **Check Registry:** Investigate what caused the registry change performed by `services.exe`\n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **False Positives:** While the actions are suspicious, there's a chance they could be legitimate. Thorough investigation is crucial.\n*   **System Context:** The actions were performed within the context of the user `fiddelis`. This may provide insights into the attack vector or compromised account.\n*   **Timeline:** The precise order of events is vital. Analyzing the timestamps of each event can help reconstruct the attack sequence."}
