This pattern strongly suggests an attempt to establish persistence through scheduled tasks. Several `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes are involved, reinforcing the suspicion.  Furthermore, evidence of file creation and process access related to PowerShell scripts is present. This combination indicates potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
