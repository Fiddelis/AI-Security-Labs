Specifically, the presence of a PowerShell command-line script taking a screenshot and saving it to the temp directory (`elemento_base.png`) is suspicious and often used for reconnaissance or credential harvesting. Coupled with numerous registry modifications by various processes (powershell.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe), a significant number of Chrome.exe registry modifications, DNS queries, and image loading events (including AMSI and Windows Defender DLLs) suggests potential reconnaissance, persistence mechanisms, or malware execution within the Chrome browser.
