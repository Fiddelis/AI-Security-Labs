Subsequent calls to `sc qc` suggest an attempt to query the created service.  Multiple `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` process executions, registry modifications, and service creation attempts strongly indicate potential malicious activity.  The unusual file path for the PowerShell script further increases suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
