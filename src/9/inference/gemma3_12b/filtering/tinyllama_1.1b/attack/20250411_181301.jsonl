Notably, 'tasklist.exe' is loading AMSI and Windows Defender DLLs which is unusual for its normal usage. The creation of a file 'registro_auxiliar.txt' by PowerShell raises suspicion, potentially indicating data exfiltration or script execution. The repetitive registry modifications by Chrome.exe are less concerning individually but, combined with other events, add to the overall suspiciousness.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
