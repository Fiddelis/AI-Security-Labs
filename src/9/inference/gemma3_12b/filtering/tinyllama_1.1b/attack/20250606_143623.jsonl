{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, I'm analyzing the provided log data. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, along with potential implications.  I'm focusing on the PowerShell commands and related events.\n\n**Overall Observations**\n\n*   **New-Service and Start-Service:** The dominant pattern is the repeated use of `New-Service` and `Start-Service` PowerShell commands. This indicates an attempt to create and start a Windows service named \"objeto\\_ativo\". The service's executable is located at `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  This is a concerning pattern, suggesting potential unauthorized service installation.\n*   **ExecutionPolicy:** The frequent use of `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is notable. This suggests a deliberate attempt to bypass PowerShell's default security settings to execute the commands. This is a significant red flag. The 'Restricted' policy is meant to prevent unsigned scripts from running.  Circumventing this policy is a sign of malicious intent.\n*   **Provider and Engine Lifecycle:** The events labeled \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" are related to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).  The creation\/start of the service is happening within the WMI framework.\n*  **Write-Host 'Final result: 1':** This command is likely being used to test the PowerShell script execution and confirm if a certain process has succeeded. The '1' value usually signals a positive result or successful process completion.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Key Events**\n\n1.  **Service Creation & Startup:**\n\n    *   `powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}`\n        *   This is the core command.  It attempts to:\n            *   Create a new Windows service named \"objeto\\_ativo\".\n            *   Set the path to the executable that runs the service (`tarefa_logico.exe`).  The location `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\` is unusual and suggests a non-standard installation path, which could be suspicious.\n            *   Immediately start the newly created service.\n    *   **Implications:** This is highly suspicious.  It strongly suggests unauthorized installation and startup of a potentially malicious service. The service name and executable path should be investigated.\n\n2.  **Bypassing Execution Policy:**\n\n    *   `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`\n        *   **Why it's concerning:** The `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` setting is a security feature. Circumventing it, even with a command like `Write-Host`, indicates an intent to run scripts that would normally be blocked. It's often a precursor to more harmful actions.\n\n**Potential Indicators of Compromise**\n\n*   **Unusual Paths:** The service executable location (`C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`) is a significant indicator. It's unlikely to be a legitimate Windows system location.\n*   **Bypassing Security:** The repeated attempts to bypass the `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` setting are a clear sign of malicious intent.\n*   **Service Name:** The name \"objeto\\_ativo\" is not a standard Windows service name.  Malicious actors often use generic or obfuscated names.\n*   **Multiple Attempts:** The fact that these commands are repeated multiple times in the log data suggests a systematic effort to install and run the service.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Investigate `tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is the highest priority.\n    *   Determine the origin of the file. Was it legitimately installed?\n    *   Scan the file with multiple antivirus solutions.\n    *   Examine the file's contents (if possible) to understand its purpose.\n2.  **Disable the Service:** If you can identify the \"objeto\\_ativo\" service, immediately disable and delete it.\n3.  **Review PowerShell History:** Examine the PowerShell history on the affected system to see if there are other suspicious commands.\n4.  **Check Scheduled Tasks:** Review scheduled tasks to see if any are related to the service or the suspicious executable.\n5.  **Review System Logs:**  Examine other system logs for related events (e.g., login failures, unusual network connections).\n6.  **Security Hardening:** Strengthen PowerShell security by:\n    *   Enforcing stricter execution policies.\n    *   Implementing script signing requirements.\n    *   Auditing PowerShell usage.\n7.  **Monitor for Persistence:** Be vigilant for any attempts by the attacker to re-establish the service or other malicious components.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided log data.  A full investigation would require a more in-depth examination of the affected system and network.  This is not exhaustive and other analysis steps may be required.\n\n\n\nTo help me refine the analysis, could you tell me:\n\n*   What is the context of these logs? (e.g., what system are they from, what was happening at the time?)\n*   Do you have information about the expected behavior of this system?\n*   Can you provide more details about the location and purpose of `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`?"}
