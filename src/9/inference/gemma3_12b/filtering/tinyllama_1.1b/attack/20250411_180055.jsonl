This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential data exfiltration or malware activity, as it suggests files are being bundled and potentially moved off the system. Several .NET DLLs are also loaded by PowerShell, which is common for scripting, but combined with the other actions strengthens the potential malicious intent. The repeated use of `Compress-Archive` with unusual paths also raises concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
