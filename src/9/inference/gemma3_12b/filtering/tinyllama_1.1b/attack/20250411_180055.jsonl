The frequent use of `Compress-Archive` and the references to specific file paths suggest potential data manipulation or preparation for exfiltration. The loaded DLLs (clr.dll, MpClient.dll) and PowerShell modules (Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive.psm1) are consistent with legitimate PowerShell usage but don's negate the suspicious command-line activity.
