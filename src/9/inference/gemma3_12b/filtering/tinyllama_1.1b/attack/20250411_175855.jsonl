There are also multiple chrome.exe processes modifying the registry. These patterns, while potentially benign, warrant investigation for potential malicious activity such as reconnaissance, credential dumping, or command execution.  The specific directory searched by `cmd.exe` also raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
