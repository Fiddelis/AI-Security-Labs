Repeated registry modifications, process creation, and pipe creation across these processes are concerning. The presence of 'git.exe' and related tools indicates a version control system is in use, which could be associated with legitimate development or malicious code deployment. The repeated 'PipeEvent' and 'RegistryEvent' rules suggest potential inter-process communication or privilege escalation attempts.
