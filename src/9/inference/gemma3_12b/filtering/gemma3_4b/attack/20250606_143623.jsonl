{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the log entries, focusing on the concerning activity:\n\n**Summary of Events & Analysis**\n\nThis log snippet reveals a suspicious attempt to create and start a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell.  The service is intended to be executed from a file located at  \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\".  This is highly suspicious for several reasons:\n\n*   **PowerShell Usage:** While PowerShell itself is a legitimate tool, its use in creating and starting services, particularly with non-standard parameters, is a red flag.\n*   **Service Name:**  \"objeto_ativo\" (meaning \"active object\" in Portuguese) is a generic name and doesn't suggest a legitimate service.\n*   **File Path:**  The path \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" is highly suspicious. It's likely a custom or unknown application attempting to run with elevated privileges through a service. The file name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" (meaning \"logical task\") provides no indication of its purpose.\n*   **Repetitive Execution:** The command is repeated multiple times, suggesting either a failed initial attempt or a continuous, potentially malicious, process.\n*   **`ExecutionPolicy Restricted`:**  The repeated use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` suggests the attacker is trying to bypass PowerShell security restrictions. While it's technically possible to use restricted execution policies, it is uncommon in normal administrative tasks.\n*   **`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`**: This command is likely a test or attempt to verify that the service creation and execution are working as expected. The '1' is likely a placeholder value, it would be important to determine its purpose.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Log Entries**\n\nHere's a more granular look at the different log entries, grouping similar ones together:\n\n*   **Initial Service Creation and Start (Repeated)**\n\n    These are the most significant entries.  They all contain the same PowerShell command designed to:\n\n    1.  Create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo.\"\n    2.  Specify the path to an executable file (\"tarefa_logico.exe\") as the binary that will run the service.\n    3.  Start the newly created service.\n\n    These repetitive entries suggest a failed initial attempt or a persistent effort to establish the service.\n\n*   **`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` (Repeated)**\n\n    These log entries confirm that PowerShell commands are being executed, indicating that the creation and starting processes are likely succeeding to a degree.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of any malicious activity.\n2.  **Investigate `tarefa_logico.exe`:**\n    *   **File Hash:**  Calculate the SHA256 hash of `tarefa_logico.exe`.  Search online threat intelligence platforms (VirusTotal, etc.) to see if it's been identified as malicious.\n    *   **Static Analysis:** Open the executable in a disassembler or debugger to understand its purpose. (Advanced skill required).\n    *   **Dynamic Analysis:** Run the executable in a sandbox environment to observe its behavior.\n3.  **Review PowerShell Execution Logs:** Examine the full PowerShell event logs on the affected system to understand the complete sequence of events.\n4.  **Examine Registry:** Look for any registry entries related to the service (`objeto_ativo`) or the executable file.\n5.  **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Look for any scheduled tasks that execute the PowerShell command or service creation script.\n6.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  If you have an EDR solution, use it to search for suspicious activity related to PowerShell, the service, and the file.\n7.  **Strengthen PowerShell Security:** Implement PowerShell restrictions and monitoring to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n8.  **Monitor Network Traffic:** Analyze network traffic for connections from the affected system to external IP addresses.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Language:** The fact that the code is written in Portuguese suggests a targeted attack against a system that uses this language.\n*   **Persistence:**  The attacker is likely attempting to establish persistence by creating a service that will run automatically even after the system is rebooted.\n*   **Lateral Movement:** The attacker might be using this foothold to move laterally within the network and compromise other systems.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide definitive security assessments.
