While 'calc.exe' itself isn't inherently malicious, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges is a common tactic used by attackers to establish persistence. The multiple variations in task names suggest a possible automated or scripted deployment. Furthermore, the subsequent loading of .NET framework DLLs by PowerShell is consistent with the execution of scripts and potentially malicious code.
