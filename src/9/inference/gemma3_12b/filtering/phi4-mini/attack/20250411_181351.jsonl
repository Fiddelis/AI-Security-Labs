Critically, several events show `powershell.exe` executing commands that capture screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory with varying filenames (unidade_logico.png, elemento_padrao.png, etc.). This is strongly indicative of reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or remote access trojan (RAT) activity.
