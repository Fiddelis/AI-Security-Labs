The creation of a temporary PowerShell script (_PSScriptPolicyTest.ptd.ps1) followed by deletion is suspicious, and the repeated 'Get-Date' commands within PowerShell suggest potential reconnaissance or obfuscation. The creation of PowerShell startup profile data is also noteworthy. Although some events appear benign (e.g., winlogbeat.exe file creation), the prevalence of PowerShell activity warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
