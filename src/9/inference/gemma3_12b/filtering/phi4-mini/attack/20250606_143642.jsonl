{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log shows a series of actions likely related to a malicious script execution. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the activity:\n\n**1. Initial Setup & Dismounting:**\n\n*   **`Dism.exe` Deletions:**  The frequent use of `Dism.exe` (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to delete DLL files (`WimProvider.dll`, `ImageProvider.dll`, etc.) suggests an attempt to disable or disrupt Windows image-related functionality.  This is a common tactic used to circumvent security measures or modify system components.\n*   **`svchost.exe` Registry Change:** A registry value set by `svchost.exe` is likely an attempt to further modify system behavior during this process.\n\n**2. PowerShell Execution and Payload Delivery:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe`  Multiple Executions:**  Numerous `powershell.exe` instances demonstrate that PowerShell is the primary vehicle for malicious activity.  The various arguments passed to PowerShell (`& { ... }`) indicate the execution of complex scripts.\n*   **`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` Creation:**  This newly created file in the `PowerShell` startup directory is extremely suspicious. It suggests an attempt to persist the malicious script or some part of its configuration. It's designed to execute when PowerShell starts in a non-interactive session (e.g., on system boot).\n*   **ZIP File Removal:** `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` This command attempts to delete a ZIP file named \"entrada\\_principal.zip\" located in the temporary folder. The `-Force` parameter bypasses confirmation prompts. This suggests the attacker uploaded this file to the system and is now deleting it to remove traces of their activities, which likely contained the malicious payload.\n*   **Image Loading:** The loading of `.dll` files by `powershell.exe` (mscoreei.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and related) indicates that the PowerShell script relies on .NET Framework components.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis log strongly suggests a malicious attack using PowerShell to disable system components and execute a payload.  The attacker is attempting to:\n\n*   **Disable security measures:** By removing relevant DLLs.\n*   **Deploy malicious code:** Using PowerShell scripts.\n*   **Persist the threat:**  By creating a startup profile data file.\n*   **Cover their tracks:** By deleting files and potentially clearing logs.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Immediate Isolation:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.\n*   **Malware Scan:** Perform a full system scan with updated anti-malware software.\n*   **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the root cause of the infection, identify the specific malware involved, and assess the extent of the compromise.\n*   **Review System Configuration:** Review system configuration and security policies to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.\n*   **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement stricter monitoring and logging of PowerShell activity.\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Consider deploying an EDR solution for enhanced threat detection and response capabilities.\n*   **Restore from Backup:** If possible, restore the system from a known-good backup.\n*   **Rebuild System:** In cases of significant compromise, rebuilding the system from scratch is the most secure option.\n\n\n\nThis is a serious situation.  Take immediate action to contain and remediate the threat."}
