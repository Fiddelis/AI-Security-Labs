The `systeminfo.exe` process also loads `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`, which is common in anti-malware tools but could indicate evasion attempts.  Multiple registry modifications by `svchost.exe` and `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` are also notable. Lastly, the creation of new Windows event logs by `svchost.exe` is also suspicious.
