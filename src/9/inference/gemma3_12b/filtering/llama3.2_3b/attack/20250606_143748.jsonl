The use of obfuscated commands, file deletions, registry modifications, and dynamic code execution (downloading and executing scripts) strongly suggests malicious activity. Furthermore, the presence of `CompatTelRunner.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpClient.dll` indicates attempts to evade detection.
