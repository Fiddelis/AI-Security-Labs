The presence of `powershell.exe` accessing processes also raises concerns. The overall pattern suggests potential malicious code execution and persistence mechanisms. While some actions might be benign in isolation (e.g., `calc.exe`), the combination warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
