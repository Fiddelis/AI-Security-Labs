The repetitive pattern of `Get-ChildItem` followed by setting `LastWriteTime` to a fixed date (01\/01\/1970) is highly suspicious. The activity also includes process access and creation events involving PowerShell, further suggesting a deliberate attempt to alter file attributes. The inclusion of `calc.exe` and `svchost.exe` with associated DLL loads might be an attempt to blend in with normal system processes, but does not negate the suspicious PowerShell activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
