While this could be legitimate system activity or a data backup process, the repetitive pattern and reliance on temporary directories is indicative of potentially malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or malicious script execution.  The involvement of `Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive` also warrants closer inspection.
