The appearance of `systeminfo.exe` alongside registry queries, coupled with the creation of a file by `powershell.exe` (`objeto_padrao.txt`) and multiple registry modifications by `chrome.exe`, suggests potential reconnaissance or initial stages of an attack.  The presence of `winlogbeat.exe` is also noteworthy as it might be part of a monitoring or potentially a malicious actor's data exfiltration. While some events are benign (e.g., `calc.exe`), the collective activity warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
