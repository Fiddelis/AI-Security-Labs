Also notable are repeated PowerShell process access events and whoami executions. The sequence strongly suggests attempted persistence and privilege escalation. The presence of chrome.exe events and winlogbeat creation alongside the suspicious activity requires further investigation, as they may be part of a broader attack chain or simply coincidental.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
