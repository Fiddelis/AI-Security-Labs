The creation of a temporary PowerShell script file (likely used to execute the complex command) further strengthens the concern. Multiple \\\"Provider Lifecycle\\\", \\\"Engine Lifecycle\\\", and \\\"Process Create\\\" events associated with PowerShell indicate a script is being repeatedly executed and processed. The presence of `cmdkey.exe \/list` is another potential credential harvesting attempt.
