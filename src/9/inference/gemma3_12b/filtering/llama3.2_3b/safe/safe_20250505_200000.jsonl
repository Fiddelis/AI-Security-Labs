The repeated 'Special Logon' events and the appearance of `SDXHelper.exe` also warrant investigation. The creation of temporary files by `svchost.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` needs further scrutiny. While `winlogbeat` is expected, it's important to understand why it's creating files during this activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
