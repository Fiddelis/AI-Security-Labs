{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided log entries, here's a summary of the events that occurred:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update (msedgeupdate.exe) related events:**\n   - The process `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was created.\n   - It loaded several DLLs from its installation directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\`).\n   - It accessed other processes and network connections were detected.\n   - The process terminated three times in quick succession, which might indicate an error or unexpected behavior.\n\n2. **Registry modification:**\n   - `RuntimeBroker.exe` set a registry value, although the specific details are not provided in the log entry.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat related events:**\n   - A new process named `winlogbeat.exe` was created from the download directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\`).\n   - It loaded its executable file and then created a log file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`.\n\n4. **PowerShell access:**\n   - The process `powershell.exe` accessed another process, although the target process is not specified in the log entry.\n\nTo summarize, these logs indicate typical Windows system behavior with some potential anomalies (the repeated termination of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe). Additionally, there's a new tool (winlogbeat) installed and running on the system."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of events and potential security concerns:\n\n1. **DeliveryOptimization Cache File Creation:**\n   - `svchost.exe` created files in `C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\Cache\\`.\n   - This could be normal behavior, but excessive or unusual activity in this folder might warrant further investigation.\n\n2. **Registry Value Set:**\n   - `Explorer.EXE` set a registry value. Registry modifications can indicate malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n3. **Microsoft Edge Update:**\n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` created and then deleted temporary files in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`. This could be part of normal update processes, but the deletion might suggest an attempt to hide activities.\n   - It also created a setup.exe file in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp`. The use of temporary folders could indicate an attempt to evade detection.\n\n4. **Pipe Created:**\n   - `setup.exe` created a pipe. Named pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but they can also be exploited for command injection or data exfiltration if not properly secured.\n\n5. **WindowsUpdate ETL File Creation:**\n   - A new WindowsUpdate log file was created in `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\`. This could indicate normal update activity, but excessive or unusual logging might warrant further investigation.\n\n6. **winlogbeat.exe Activity:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` created a new config file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`. This could suggest that someone is configuring or reconfiguring the logging system, which might warrant further review to ensure no unauthorized changes are being made.\n\nGiven these activities, it would be wise to investigate further to determine if they are part of normal operations or indicative of malicious activity. Some steps you might consider include:\n\n- Reviewing the contents and timestamps of the created files.\n- Checking for unusual registry modifications.\n- Investigating the purpose and behavior of the named pipe.\n- Assessing the nature and frequency of WindowsUpdate logging.\n- Verifying that `winlogbeat.exe` is being configured appropriately and by authorized personnel."}
