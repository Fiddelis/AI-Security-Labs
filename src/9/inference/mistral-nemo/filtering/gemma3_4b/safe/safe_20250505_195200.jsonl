The file paths involve \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" files with different hashes, indicating that various versions or instances of these files are being created and potentially deleted.\n\nHere are a few examples of the file paths:\n\n- `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_1234567890.js`\n- `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_abcdefghi.js`\n\nTo address or investigate this issue, you might want to:\n\n- Check if there are any ongoing installations, updates, or uninstalls of Office-related software.\n- Verify if the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process is a legitimate part of your system's operation and whether it should be running repeatedly for such tasks.\n- Monitor the behavior of the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process to ensure that it isn't causing any unusual activity or performance issues on your system."}

These files are presumably JavaScript or TypeScript files, given the \".min\" suffix which often indicates minified files.\n\n4. **File Location**: All these files are being created in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\n   ```\n\nGiven that these files are being created by the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process and they're located in a directory related to Microsoft Office, it's likely that this process is involved with creating or updating offline resources for some Office-related functionality (like language packs, help content, etc.). The repeated creation of these files could be due to updates, changes, or scheduled maintenance tasks.

If you suspect malware activity, consider running a virus\/malware scan on your system.\n\nTo investigate this further:\n\n1. Check the properties of the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process to identify the application it belongs to.\n2.
