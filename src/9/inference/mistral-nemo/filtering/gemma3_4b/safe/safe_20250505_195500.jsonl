Here are a few observations and suggestions:\n\n1. **File Content**: Without inspecting the content of these files, it's hard to determine their purpose. They could be cache or temporary files created by an Office-related process ( possibly related to AI or copilot features).\n\n2. **Process Owner**: `SDXHelper.exe` is likely associated with Microsoft Office, as suggested by the prefix \"office\" in the filenames.\n\n3. **Hash in Filenames**: The `<hash>` part of the filename suggests that these files might be unique instances created for specific purposes or data.\n\n4. **Repeated Creation**: The repetition of file creation might indicate a process that's either stuck in a loop, or is intended to run repeatedly (e.g., checking for updates or changes).\n\nTo manage this situation:\n\n- If these files are indeed temporary or cache files, they should be deleted automatically upon closing the application. If not, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for assistance.\n- To troubleshoot, you could try the following:\n  - Close and reopen the problematic application (e.g., Office) to see if that stops the repeated file creation.\n  - Check if there's an update pending for the application, as updates sometimes cause such behaviors during installation.\n  - If files keep piling up, consider moving or deleting them manually, but be cautious not to remove necessary files."}
