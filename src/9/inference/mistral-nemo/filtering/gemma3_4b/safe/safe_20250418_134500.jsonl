This could suggest an attacker attempting to install monitoring tools.\n\nTo further investigate these events:\n- Check if any unwanted software was installed recently.\n- Monitor processes communicating via pipes for suspicious activity.\n- Verify why Winlogbeat was installed in the Downloads folder and who initiated its installation."}
