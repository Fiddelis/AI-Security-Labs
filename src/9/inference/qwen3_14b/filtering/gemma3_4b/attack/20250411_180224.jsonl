So, the user provided a bunch of log entries and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to look through all these events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too bad on its own. But then there's a cmd.exe process that runs schtasks to create a scheduled task that executes a PowerShell script. The command line here is a bit worrying because it's using the system account, running daily, and the script path is non-existent. That might be a red flag. The script file isn't there, which could mean someone is trying to execute a non-existent script, maybe to hide the actual payload.\n\nThen there's another schtasks.exe entry creating the same task again. The file created is in the Tasks directory, which is normal for scheduled tasks, but the script path still doesn't exist. Also, there are multiple registry value sets for svchost.exe and chrome.exe. A lot of registry changes might be normal, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe PowerShell processes accessing files and creating files like estrutura_geral.txt and entrada_ativo.txt. Those files might be part of data exfiltration or logging. Also, the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file could be related to configuration changes, maybe trying to compromise the logging setup.\n\nBut wait, there are also a lot of chrome.exe entries with registry changes. That might be normal user activity, but combined with the scheduled tasks and PowerShell commands, it's suspicious. The use of -ep bypass in PowerShell is a common technique to bypass execution policies, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent.\n\nThe multiple entries of svchost.exe and chrome.exe modifying registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the fact that the scheduled task is set to run as the system account with high privileges is a big red flag. If an attacker can get a scheduled task running as system, they have a lot of access.\n\nHowever, there are also legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and normal file creations. But the combination of these events—scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts, PowerShell bypassing execution policies, multiple registry changes, and file creations in user directories—points towards a potential security incident.\n\nI should check if all these events are part of a coordinated attack. The presence of schtasks creating a task that runs a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute a payload that's not on the disk, maybe in memory. Alternatively, the script might have been deleted after execution. The repeated registry changes could be part of maintaining access or hiding the attack.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does show multiple suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The confidence is high, but not 100% certain without more context. However, the indicators present are strong enough to flag this as potentially malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion:**\n1. **Malicious Scheduled Task Creation:**\n   - A `cmd.exe` process creates a scheduled task (`schtasks`) configured to run as the **system account** with high privileges, executing a PowerShell script (`NonExistentScript.ps1`). This is highly unusual and likely an attempt to:\n     - **Bypass execution policies** using `-ep bypass`.\n     - **Execute a non-existent script**, possibly indicating **in-memory execution** or a **hidden payload**.\n     - **Maintain persistence** via the system account.\n\n2. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes are involved in:\n     - **File creation** (e.g., `estrutura_geral.txt`, `entrada_ativo.txt`), which could indicate **data exfiltration** or **logging**.\n     - **Process access** events, possibly probing for vulnerabilities or interacting with malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Unusual Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequent registry changes** by `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe` (e.g., `chrome.exe` modifying registry keys 12 times). While not inherently malicious, this could indicate:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup entries).\n     - **Obfuscation** of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Anomalies:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates a `.yml.new` file, which may represent **tampering with logging\/configurations** to evade detection.\n\n5. **High Volume of Chrome Activity:**\n   - **12 registry modifications** by `chrome.exe` are excessive and could signal **malware injection** or **exploitation** (e.g., browser-based attacks).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Suspicious:**\n- The combination of **scheduled task persistence**, **PowerShell bypassing execution policies**, and **unusual file creation** strongly suggests **malicious intent**.\n- The **non-existent script path** (`NonExistentScript.ps1`) is a red flag, often used in **in-memory attacks** or **payload obfuscation**.\n- The **system account** elevation via `schtasks` indicates **high-privilege access** being exploited.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log batch shows **clear signs of a potential security incident** (e.g., persistence, privilege escalation, data exfiltration). While some activity (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`, normal file creation) may be benign, the **coordinated use of PowerShell, scheduled tasks, and registry modifications** warrants **urgent investigation**.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High (85%+).  \n**Recommended Action:** Isolate the host, analyze memory dumps, and investigate the source of the scheduled task and PowerShell commands."}
