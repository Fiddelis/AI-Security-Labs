{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but sometimes used in attacks. However, just running whoami isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The command line for one of the cmd.exe processes is creating a service with sc.exe, which is used to manage Windows services. The command line has a path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\". The names here are in Portuguese, which might be a red flag. Also, the service is set to start automatically, which could be a sign of persistence.\n\nThen there's another sc.exe command creating another service with a path that includes \"modulo_geral\" and \"unidade_base.exe\". These names don't look standard. Also, the use of sc.exe to create services is a common technique in malware to maintain persistence on the system.\n\nLooking at the image load events, there are several DLLs loaded from the .NET Framework directories. Some of these are standard, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, but the presence of multiple image loads, especially if they are from unexpected locations, might be a concern. However, in this case, the paths are legitimate .NET directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nBut wait, the process names like \"elemento_ativo.exe\" and \"modulo_secundario.exe\" are in Portuguese again. That might be a red flag if they are not standard system processes. Also, the fact that multiple services are being created with non-standard names and paths could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of Registry value set events by services.exe and other processes. While services.exe is a legitimate system process, if it's modifying registry keys in a way that's unusual, that could be suspicious. However, the logs don't provide specific details on which registry keys are being modified, so that's a bit hard to assess.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious activities are the creation of multiple services with non-standard names and paths, the use of sc.exe which is often abused in attacks, and the presence of processes with names that might be obfuscated or in a different language. Even though some activities are normal (like chrome.exe's network activity), the combination of these events points towards potential malicious behavior. The confidence here would be moderate to high, but not 100% certain without more context. However, enough red flags are present to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **multiple suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual Service Creation via `sc.exe`:**\n   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` are used to create services with non-standard names (e.g., `unidade_base.exe`, `modulo_geral.exe`) and paths containing obfuscated or non-English terms (e.g., `elemento_geral`, `modulo_geral`). \n   - Example command:  \n     ```bash\n     sc create \"modulo_geral\" binPath= \"C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe\" start= auto\n     ```\n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - `sc.exe` is often abused by malware to create persistent services.  \n     - The use of non-English, obfuscated names may indicate an attempt to evade detection.  \n     - Automatic startup (`start= auto`) suggests persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Malicious Process Names and Paths:**\n   - Processes like `modulo_secundario.exe`, `elemento_ativo.exe`, and `estrutura_principal.exe` are created with names that resemble obfuscated or non-standard software.  \n   - While some paths (e.g., `.NET Framework directories`) are legitimate, the combination of unusual process names and service creation raises concerns.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple entries show `Registry value set` events by processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `elemento_ativo.exe`.  \n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - Unauthorized registry changes can be used to modify system behavior or install backdoors.  \n     - The lack of context (e.g., which keys are modified) makes this a red flag.\n\n4. **Image Load Events with .NET DLLs:**\n   - Legitimate .NET DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) are loaded, but **in combination with other suspicious activities**, this could indicate a malicious payload disguised as a .NET application.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity:**\n- **Chrome.exe**: Normal DNS queries and network connections are expected for a browser.  \n- **whoami.exe**: A standard utility for retrieving user information, though its use in this context may be benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log contains **multiple indicators of compromise (IoCs)** that align with **malware persistence techniques** (e.g., service creation, registry modifications) and **obfuscation** (non-English process names). While some activity is legitimate, the **combination of suspicious processes, service creation, and registry changes** strongly suggests **malicious behavior** requiring further investigation (e.g., process memory analysis, network traffic inspection, and registry key checks).\n\n**Confidence Level:** **High** (75–90%) – The observed patterns are consistent with adversarial activity, though additional context is needed to confirm."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. Maybe the user is installing or configuring it.\n\nThen there are several events involving powershell.exe with tasks like Registry value set and Process accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. However, just having these events doesn't immediately indicate a problem. Need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nAnother event shows RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, handling app permissions, so that's normal. Notepad modifying the registry might be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe the user is making legitimate changes.\n\nThen there's calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll from System32. Urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL used for URL downloads. Both calc.exe and Calculator.exe are standard Windows applications. This seems normal unless there's a different path or unexpected behavior, but here the paths are correct.\n\nLooking at the repetition of svchost.exe modifying registry values. Svchost is a host process for Windows services, and it's common for it to interact with the registry. Multiple events here might be part of normal service operations, but if there's a pattern or unusual activity, that could be a red flag. However, in this batch, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The main thing is the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That's part of a normal installation. The other events involve standard processes doing typical tasks. There's no evidence of malicious activity like unexpected file creations, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation. The processes mentioned are all legitimate, and the actions are within normal operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch doesn't show any signs of malicious behavior. The events are consistent with normal system operations and software installation. Therefore, it's likely not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system operations and software installation activities. Winlogbeat configuration file creation, PowerShell registry access, and standard process interactions (e.g., svchost, calc.exe) are consistent with legitimate system behavior. No malicious patterns or suspicious artifacts are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
