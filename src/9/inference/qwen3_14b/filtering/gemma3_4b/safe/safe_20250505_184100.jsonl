{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user is asking if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: DiscordSetup.exe is being created. That's a normal installation process, right? Then there's an ImageLoaded for the same executable. Then, Update.exe is created in the SquirrelTemp directory. Squirrel is a framework used for updating applications, so this might be part of a legitimate update process. But wait, there's a lot of ImageLoad events for Update.exe loading .NET DLLs. That's common for .NET applications, but maybe there's something suspicious here.\n\nLooking further, Update.exe creates files in the AppData directory, which is typical for installations. However, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. ProcessAccess can indicate that another process is interacting with Update.exe, which might be normal during an update, but if there are too many, it could be a sign of something malicious. Also, the command line for Update.exe includes \"--install .\", which is part of Squirrel's update process, so that seems legitimate.\n\nBut then there's the creation of Discord.exe in the AppData directory. The command line for Discord.exe includes \"--squirrel-install 1.0.9190\", which again is part of the Squirrel update mechanism. So, this seems like a standard update process for Discord. However, the high number of ProcessAccess events might be a red flag. Normally, during an update, you might have a few process accesses, but 24 instances here could be unusual. It might be that the system is being monitored, or maybe there's a tool like winlogbeat involved, which is a log shipper. The event where winlogbeat creates a .yml.new file is normal for configuration updates.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this is interesting. The key here is whether these events are part of a legitimate process or if there's any anomaly. The presence of multiple ProcessAccess events could be normal if the update process is interacting with many components, but in some cases, it might be a sign of a malicious process trying to access other processes. However, since the executables involved (DiscordSetup.exe, Update.exe, Discord.exe) are known legitimate files from Discord, and the paths are in standard locations like AppData and Downloads, this seems like a normal installation and update process.\n\nBut the high number of ProcessAccess events might still be a concern. Let me check how many there are. Counting them: there are 24 entries with \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" for Update.exe. That seems a lot. However, if the update process is complex and involves multiple interactions, maybe that's normal. Alternatively, it could be a sign of a malicious process trying to access other processes. However, without more context, such as other events indicating suspicious behavior, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the initial process is DiscordSetup.exe, which is a legitimate installer. The subsequent steps involve Update.exe, which is part of the Squirrel framework used by many applications for updates. The creation of the Discord.exe in the AppData directory is part of the installation. So, all these steps are part of a standard update process. The high number of ProcessAccess events might be due to the Squirrel framework's behavior, which could involve multiple process interactions.\n\nHowever, since the user is asking if this is interesting, the answer might depend on whether the system is expected to have such activity. If this is a normal user installing or updating Discord, then it's not suspicious. But if this is happening on a system where such activity is unexpected, it could be worth investigating. But given the information here, the events appear to be part of a legitimate process. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there are other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs provided appears to represent a **legitimate software installation and update process** for Discord, using the **Squirrel framework** (commonly used for application updates). Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Executables and Paths:**\n   - **`DiscordSetup.exe`** and **`Update.exe`** are standard components of the Squirrel update framework.\n   - **`Discord.exe`** is created in the expected location: `AppData\\Local\\Discord\\app-1.0.9190`, which is typical for installed applications.\n   - Paths like `SquirrelTemp` and `AppData` are standard for temporary files and application data.\n\n2. **Normal Squirrel Update Behavior:**\n   - The command-line argument `--squirrel-install 1.0.9190` is part of Squirrel's update process.\n   - Multiple **`ImageLoad`** events for `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.dll`, `System.dll`) are expected for .NET applications.\n\n3. **High Volume of `ProcessAccess` Events:**\n   - **24 instances** of `ProcessAccess` for **`Update.exe`** may raise concern. However, this is **not inherently suspicious** in the context of a Squirrel update, as the framework may interact with multiple system components during installation.\n\n4. **`winlogbeat` Activity:**\n   - A single event where **`winlogbeat`** creates a `.yml.new` file is normal for configuration updates in log-shipping tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Interesting for Investigation?**\n- **No**, **not suspicious** based on the provided logs. All events align with:\n  - **Legitimate software installation\/updates** (Discord via Squirrel).\n  - **Standard system behavior** for .NET applications and update frameworks.\n  - **No anomalies** like unexpected network activity, unusual file paths, or non-standard command-line arguments.\n\n---\n\n### **When Would This Be Interesting?**\n- If **`ProcessAccess`** events were **unrelated to the update** (e.g., interacting with system processes like `explorer.exe`, `svchost.exe`, or security tools).\n- If **`Update.exe`** or **`Discord.exe`** had **unusual file hashes** or **non-standard digital signatures**.\n- If **`winlogbeat`** was involved in **unauthorized data collection** or **malicious activity** (not indicated here).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect **normal user activity** (installing\/updating Discord). No signs of compromise or suspicious behavior are evident. **No further investigation** is warranted unless additional context (e.g., unexpected network traffic, system instability) is present."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all related to Discord.exe and Update.exe. I need to figure out if this is interesting or not.\n\nFirst, looking at the events: there's a lot of Image Load events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll. Also, multiple Pipe Created events. Then there's an Update.exe process that's loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. \n\nHmm, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for the same DLLs might be normal, but maybe not. Wait, the first entry has ffmpeg.dll loaded by Discord.exe. Then later, the same DLL is loaded again. But that's part of the application's normal operation, right? Discord might use ffmpeg for video processing.\n\nBut then there's the Update.exe process. It's loading several .NET framework DLLs. That's a bit unusual because Update.exe is typically part of an installer or updater, but the fact that it's loading .NET components might indicate that it's performing some operations that require the .NET runtime. However, the command line for Update.exe shows it's creating a shortcut and setting up icons, which is normal for an updater.\n\nWait, but the path for Update.exe is in the local Discord directory. The command line includes --createShortcut, which is part of standard update processes. The loading of mscoree.dll and clr.dll is part of .NET execution, which might be expected if the updater is written in .NET. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system DLLs could be a red flag if they're not part of the application's normal behavior.\n\nBut looking at the paths, the .NET DLLs are from standard Windows locations like C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET. That seems legitimate. The Update.exe is in the Discord app data folder, which is expected for an application's updater.\n\nNow, the Pipe Created events are frequent. Discord might use named pipes for communication between processes, which is normal. However, multiple PipeEvents could be part of normal operation, especially if the application is running multiple instances or services.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any suspicious DLLs being loaded? The ffmpeg.dll is a common library, and the .NET DLLs are standard. No unusual paths or unexpected files mentioned here.\n\nThe command lines for Discord.exe include typical parameters like --type=gpu-process, which is normal for Chrome-based applications (Discord uses Chromium). The variations-seed-version and other flags are also standard for such apps.\n\nSo, considering all that, these logs seem to be part of normal application operations. Even though there are multiple ImageLoad and PipeCreated events, they align with what a typical application like Discord would do. No signs of malware or suspicious activities. Therefore, this might not be interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided appear to represent **normal operational behavior** of the Discord application and its associated updater process. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Discord.exe Activity**:\n   - **Image Load Events**: Frequent loading of `ffmpeg.dll` and `Discord.exe` itself are expected for a media-rich application like Discord, which uses FFmpeg for video\/audio processing and Chromium for its UI.\n   - **Pipe Created Events**: Multiple `PipeEvent` entries are typical for inter-process communication (IPC) in applications with modular architecture (e.g., GPU processes, background services).\n\n2. **Update.exe Behavior**:\n   - **.NET DLLs**: Loading of `.NET` components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is consistent with an updater written in .NET, which is common for Windows applications.\n   - **Command-Line Arguments**: The `--createShortcut` and icon setup are standard for installers\/updaters.\n\n3. **Paths and Context**:\n   - All DLLs are loaded from legitimate system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET`) or the local Discord installation folder, with no signs of rogue or unexpected files.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is **no evidence of malicious activity** in these logs. The events align with typical application behavior for Discord and its updater. **Not interesting** from a security or anomaly detection perspective. \n\n**Classification**: Normal operational logs."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: Discord.exe is being created with a long command line. That's normal for applications, but maybe the parameters are unusual? Let me check. The command line includes some --disable-features and other flags. Hmm, some of these flags might be typical for Discord, but I'm not sure. Maybe not a red flag yet.\n\nThen there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Discord.exe. That's common during normal operations, so probably not suspicious. Then ImageLoad events for Discord.exe loading DLLs like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, and libGLESv2.dll. Those are legitimate libraries used by Discord for media and graphics, so that seems normal.\n\nNow, looking at the Update.exe entries. There are several FileCreate events for Discord.lnk shortcuts in different locations: Start Menu, Desktop, and another in the same directory. Creating multiple shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but if it's done by an update process, maybe that's part of a legitimate update. However, the same process (Update.exe) is also generating a lot of ProcessAccess events. That's a lot of access attempts. Why so many? Maybe it's a sign of something trying to interact with the system more than necessary.\n\nWait, but Update.exe is a legitimate process for software updates. However, if it's creating multiple shortcuts and accessing processes repeatedly, it could be part of a malicious activity. But I need to check if this is normal behavior for Discord's update process. Typically, updates might create shortcuts, but creating multiple ones in different locations might be unusual. Also, the repetition of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe could indicate some kind of persistence mechanism or unauthorized access.\n\nAnother thing to note: all the events are related to Discord and its update process. No other processes or suspicious files are mentioned. The files created are shortcuts, which are not executable, so maybe that's just part of the installation or update. However, the high number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe might be a red flag. Maybe the update process is being used to access other processes inappropriately.\n\nBut I also have to consider that this could be a legitimate update. Discord might be updating itself, creating shortcuts, and accessing processes as part of the update. However, the sheer number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe (multiple entries) might be more than usual. If this were a malicious process, it might be trying to access other processes to inject code or do something harmful. But without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nOn the other hand, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for legitimate DLLs doesn't seem suspicious. The initial process creation for Discord.exe with a long command line might be normal for an application with many flags. However, the disable-features flag could be hiding something, but I can't be sure without more context.\n\nI think the key points here are the multiple FileCreate events for shortcuts and the numerous ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. If this is a known legitimate behavior, it's not suspicious. If not, it might be worth investigating. Since the user is asking whether this is interesting for investigation, I should lean towards yes, because the high number of ProcessAccess events and shortcut creations could indicate unusual activity, even if it's not definitively malicious. It's not a clear-cut case, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further look into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows **normal application behavior** for **Discord** and its **Update.exe** process, but there are **a few anomalies** that warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Activity (Normal Behavior)**\n- **Discord.exe**:\n  - **ImageLoad** events for standard DLLs like `ffmpeg.dll`, `d3dcompiler_47.dll`, and `libGLESv2.dll` are typical for media and graphics processing.\n  - The long command-line arguments (e.g., `--disable-features`) are common in applications to configure runtime behavior, though specific flags may require deeper analysis.\n\n- **Update.exe**:\n  - **FileCreate** events for `Discord.lnk` shortcuts in multiple locations (e.g., Desktop, Start Menu) are consistent with software update processes that reconfigure shortcuts during installation.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Anomalies (Potential Red Flags)**\n- **Excessive ProcessAccess Events for Update.exe**:\n  - **20+ \"ProcessAccess\" events** for `Update.exe` in a short timeframe are highly unusual. Legitimate update processes typically do not require repeated access to other processes unless explicitly needed (e.g., patching or configuration).\n  - This could indicate **unauthorized interaction** with other processes, **persistence mechanisms**, or **malicious behavior** (e.g., code injection).\n\n- **Multiple Shortcut Creation**:\n  - While creating shortcuts is normal, **redundant shortcuts** in multiple locations (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk` and `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Discord.lnk`) might suggest **post-exploitation activity** (e.g., user persistence via shortcuts) or **malware mimicking legitimate behavior**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**: The logs do not show direct evidence of malware (e.g., suspicious files, network activity, or system modifications). However, the **high volume of ProcessAccess events** for `Update.exe` and **redundant shortcut creation** are **unusual** and could indicate:\n  - **Malicious Update Process**: A compromised `Update.exe` attempting to access other processes.\n  - **False Positives**: Legitimate behavior if Discord's update process is unusually verbose.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for:\n  - Network activity from `Update.exe` (e.g., communication with external servers).\n  - System modifications (e.g., new registry entries, scheduled tasks).\n- **Analyze `Update.exe`**: Verify its digital signature and compare its hash with known-good versions of Discord's update tool.\n- **Monitor User Behavior**: If the user is a regular, check if this activity aligns with their typical usage patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs **do not confirm malicious activity**, the **abnormal frequency of ProcessAccess events** and **redundant shortcut creation** merit **further investigation** to rule out potential threats. This would be a **low-priority alert** unless other indicators of compromise (IOCs) are present."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about Discord.exe loading DLLs like libEGL.dll, vulkan-1.dll, and vk_swiftshader.dll. These are typical for a Discord application, especially if it's using graphics libraries. So far, nothing suspicious here. Maybe part of normal operation.\n\nThen there's Update.exe creating a shortcut in the Start Menu and on the desktop. Creating shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but when combined with other events, it might be a red flag. However, the shortcut points to Discord's Update.exe, which could be part of a legitimate update process. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. A lot of these might be normal, but the repetition could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the process is being monitored or accessed by other components.\n\nThe key event here is the reg.exe process adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. The value is set to run Discord.exe via Update.exe. This is a common technique for malware to persist across reboots. The command line shows that it's adding a startup entry, which is suspicious because legitimate applications usually don't modify the registry this way without user consent.\n\nAnother reg.exe event adds a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord, which is related to URL protocols. This could be part of a legitimate setup, but combined with the previous registry modification, it might indicate an attempt to create a protocol handler, which could be used for phishing or redirecting traffic.\n\nThe multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe might be normal inter-process communication, but again, in combination with the registry changes, it's worth looking into.\n\nPutting this all together: the legitimate Discord application is loading necessary DLLs, which is normal. However, the presence of Update.exe creating shortcuts and modifying the registry to add a startup entry and a protocol handler is suspicious. These actions could be part of a malicious payload trying to persist and possibly hijack the Discord application or its protocols. Even though some actions might be part of a legitimate update process, the combination of registry modifications and multiple process accesses raises a red flag.

There are multiple entries of \"Pipe Created\" and \"Process accessed\" events. But then there are some reg.exe commands modifying the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That seems a bit odd because modifying registry keys related to how applications are launched can be a sign of something malicious, like changing the default icon or the command that's executed when a protocol is used.\n\nLooking at the reg.exe commands, they're adding values like \"URL Protocol\" and setting the default icon and the command for the shell open. That might be part of setting up a custom protocol handler, which isn't necessarily bad, but if it's done without user consent, it could be a red flag. However, Discord is a legitimate application, so maybe this is just part of its normal installation or update process.\n\nThen there's an entry where Update.exe is involved. It loads urlmon.dll from SysWOW64, which is a legitimate DLL, but sometimes malware uses similar names. Also, Update.exe is creating a shortcut in the Start Menu. That's normal for installations, but combined with the registry changes, maybe it's part of a legitimate update process.\n\nWait, but there's also an Image Load event for ffmpeg.dll, which is a common library, but again, if it's being loaded by Discord, that's probably normal. However, the fact that there are multiple Pipe Created events could indicate that Discord is creating named pipes for communication, which is normal for some applications but could be abused by malware.\n\nBut the key point here is the combination of the registry modifications and the process activities. The reg.exe commands are modifying the registry entries for Discord, which might be part of setting up a protocol handler. However, if this is part of a legitimate installation, then it's not suspicious. But if these changes are made in a way that's not typical for Discord, it could be a sign of compromise.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple Process accessed events for Discord.exe. That might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of accesses or if they're from unexpected sources, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't show any other processes interacting with Discord.exe except for the ones mentioned.\n\nThe presence of Update.exe creating a shortcut and accessing the file system might be part of a legitimate update process, but again, if this is part of a malicious actor's attempt to install something, it could be a red flag.

But creating a shortcut file on the desktop could be a red flag, especially if it's linked to something like Discord. However, Discord itself is a legitimate application, so maybe that's just part of its normal operation.\n\nLooking at the command lines for Discord.exe, they seem to be standard parameters for launching the application, including things like GPU processes and various flags. The image loaded events point to legitimate files in the Discord installation directory. The registry events might be part of the application's setup or updates.\n\nBut wait, there's also a \"Registry value set\" event. Changing registry values can sometimes be part of malware behavior, but again, it could be legitimate. The key here is whether there's a pattern. Since most events are related to Update.exe and Discord.exe, and the Discord entries seem to be normal operations, maybe the only suspicious part is the shortcut creation. However, creating a shortcut isn't necessarily malicious unless it's part of a larger pattern, like multiple shortcuts or unexpected paths.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that Update.exe is being accessed multiple times might be normal if it's part of an update process. But if Update.exe isn't a known legitimate process, that could be a concern.

There are a bunch of repeated entries, which might be normal if it's just the application running, but maybe there's something unusual here. Then I see two entries involving reg.exe, which is the Windows registry tool. The command lines show that reg.exe is adding entries to the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That's a red flag because modifying the registry, especially in the Classes key, can be part of malware behavior, like setting up protocol handlers or other persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the specific commands: the first reg.exe command adds a value \"URL:Discord Protocol\" to the Discord key. The second one adds \"URL Protocol\" with a blank value. These could be part of setting up a custom protocol handler, which might be legitimate for Discord, but combined with the high number of ProcessAccess and PipeCreated events for Discord.exe, it's suspicious. \n\nAlso, there's an ImageLoad event for ffmpeg.dll. While Discord might use ffmpeg, the fact that it's being loaded as part of the process could be normal, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events might indicate that the process is being accessed by other processes or threads in an unusual way, which could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The presence of registry modifications by reg.exe, even if they are legitimate, combined with the high volume of events related to Discord.exe, might indicate either a benign application with lots of activity or a potential threat. Since the classification is about whether it's interesting for investigation, the registry changes and the high number of events are enough to flag it as interesting.

Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if there are multiple instances, maybe that's unusual.

However, the temp directory is a common place for malware to drop files. \n\nThe network connections and DNS queries are normal for a messaging app, but the frequency might be high. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious domains or unusual IP addresses. \n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the registry modifications by reg.exe, the unusual command-line arguments with unzip, and the executable in the Temp directory. But since Discord is a legitimate app, these could be part of its normal operations. However, the combination of registry changes and the temp file might indicate something more. \n\nBut without more context, like known malicious activity or other indicators, it's hard to say. The presence of legitimate processes with normal activities might mean this isn't a threat. However, the unusual parameters and temp file could be worth investigating further. So the classification is interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows reg.exe modifying Discord's registry entries (potentially legitimate), but also includes multiple Discord.exe process events with unusual parameters (e.g., --utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper) and a suspicious file execution in the Temp directory (Google.Widevine.CDM.dll). While some activity may be normal for Discord, the combination of registry modifications, unusual process parameters, and temp directory file execution warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries, all related to Discord.exe. Each entry has a winlog task, mostly \"Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)\" but there's also a \"Process terminated\" and a \"Registry value set\" event.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is interesting. The main thing here is that all the events are from Discord.exe. Discord is a legitimate application, so normal network connections and registry changes might be expected. However, the repetition of network connections could be a red flag. But wait, Discord is a communication app, so it's normal for it to have multiple network connections. The ProcessTerminate event might indicate that the process was stopped, but that's also normal if the user closed it. The RegistryEvent could be part of normal operations, like updating settings.\n\nBut the question is whether this batch is interesting for investigation. Since all events are from a legitimate process and there's no indication of malicious activity like unexpected network destinations, unusual file operations, or unauthorized registry changes, it might not be interesting. However, the high number of network connections could be suspicious. But again, Discord is known for frequent network activity. Without additional context, like unusual IP addresses or unexpected behavior, these events alone don't point to a security threat. So the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" because they're normal operations of a legitimate application.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Discord.exe process activity (network connections, process termination, registry changes) which are expected for a standard application. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
