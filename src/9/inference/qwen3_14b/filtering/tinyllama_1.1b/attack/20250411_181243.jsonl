{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple PowerShell.exe processes. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be suspicious. Looking at the command line of one of the PowerShell processes, there's a lot of commands being executed: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. These commands are gathering information about users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag because an attacker might be enumerating the system to find vulnerabilities or credentials.\n\nThen there's the creation and deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating a script and then deleting it could be part of executing a malicious script without leaving evidence. The file name has a PSScriptPolicyTest prefix, which might be a way to bypass execution policies, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlso, there are Image Load events for several DLLs, including mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Some of these are related to .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, but MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. Loading that might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of something else.\n\nThere's a process named net1.exe, which seems like a typo or a malicious mimic of net.exe. The command line is similar to the legitimate net.exe, but the name is slightly off. That's suspicious because attackers sometimes rename executables to avoid detection.\n\nThe events also include a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication, possibly for malicious purposes. Additionally, there's a Security Group Management event, which might relate to changes in user groups, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell commands gathering system info, creation and deletion of temporary scripts, loading of DLLs, a suspicious net1.exe process, and other events that could indicate system enumeration. These are all indicators of potentially malicious activity, such as an attacker trying to gather information for further attacks. However, some of these events could be legitimate, like normal PowerShell usage or system maintenance. But the combination of these events, especially the command lines and the suspicious process name, makes me lean towards classifying this as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential **malicious activity** or **system enumeration**. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Command Enumeration**\n- **Command Line Example**:  \n  `powershell.exe` executing a series of commands:  \n  ```bash\n  net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup\n  ```\n  - **Indication**: These commands are **gathering system information** (users, groups, stored credentials, file systems). This is a **common tactic during reconnaissance** phases of an attack.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Suspicious File Activity**\n- **Temporary Script File**:  \n  A script file is created and immediately deleted:  \n  ```bash\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\n  ```\n  - **Indication**: Creation and deletion of temporary files may indicate **execution of malicious scripts** or **attempts to bypass security policies** (e.g., using `PSScriptPolicyTest` as a decoy).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Anomalous Process Names**\n- **`net1.exe`**:  \n  - A process named `net1.exe` (similar to legitimate `net.exe`) is executed with the command:  \n    ```bash\n    C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1 user\n    ```\n  - **Indication**: This is likely a **malicious mimic** of the legitimate `net.exe` tool, possibly used to **avoid detection** or **execute unauthorized commands**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. DLL Loading and System Interaction**\n- **Loaded DLLs**:  \n  - `urlmon.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component) are loaded.  \n  - **Indication**: While some DLLs are normal for PowerShell\/.NET operations, the **presence of Windows Defender DLLs** in unexpected contexts may suggest **tampering** or **malware evasion** techniques.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Pipe Creation and Security Group Management**\n- **Pipe Created Event**:  \n  - A pipe event (`PipeEvent`) is logged, which could be used for **inter-process communication** (IPC) in attacks (e.g., **C2 communication** or **data exfiltration**).\n- **Security Group Management Event**:  \n  - A vague log entry (`Security Group Management`) may indicate **changes to user\/group permissions**, though more context is needed to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Interesting for Investigation**\n- **Why?** The combination of **system enumeration via PowerShell**, **suspicious file activity**, **anomalous process names**, and **unusual DLL loading** strongly suggests **potential malicious activity** (e.g., **reconnaissance, lateral movement, or credential harvesting**).  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Correlate these events with **user behavior** (e.g., who initiated the PowerShell sessions).  \n  - Check for **unauthorized changes to system files** or **group policies**.  \n  - Analyze the **network traffic** associated with these processes (e.g., `net1.exe`, pipe events).  \n  - Investigate the **origin of the `net1.exe` file** (hash analysis, file integrity checks).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment**\n**This batch of logs is highly suspicious and merits immediate investigation** due to the **high-risk indicators** listed above. While some activities (e.g., PowerShell use) are common, the **contextual anomalies** strongly suggest **malicious intent**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple entries with \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" tasks in the winlog. But the process and file fields are \"None\". Hmm, those might be normal system events, maybe just logging changes in security groups or user accounts. Not sure yet, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's an entry with cmdkey.exe listing credentials. That's a legitimate command, but if it's being used in a suspicious context, maybe. But just listing credentials isn't necessarily bad. However, if there's a lot of that, or if it's combined with other suspicious activities, that could be a red flag.\n\nNext, powershell.exe and conhost.exe are involved in registry value sets. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Setting registry values could be part of configuration changes, but if it's being used to modify critical registry keys, that's a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the file path is in the Downloads folder, which sometimes is used by malware. However, if the user is setting up Winlogbeat, that's expected. Still, the presence of a new configuration file might be worth checking.\n\nOther entries include notepad.exe and svchost.exe modifying registry values. Again, svchost is a standard process for hosting services, but if it's making unexpected changes, that's suspicious. However, without more context on what specific registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say.\n\nThe last entry is Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL for Internet Explorer, so loading it isn't necessarily bad. But if Calculator.exe is being used to load unexpected DLLs, that might be an issue. However, the path here is the standard System32 location, so it's probably legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: there are several registry modifications by PowerShell and other processes, which could be part of normal operations or could be signs of configuration changes by malware. The presence of cmdkey.exe listing credentials might be benign, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger pattern. The file creation by Winlogbeat is likely normal, but the overall number of events related to registry changes and process creations might indicate some level of activity that's worth investigating further. However, there's no clear evidence of a malicious attack here, just potentially unusual activity that could be either benign or suspicious. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events involving powershell.exe and svchost.exe, combined with process creation\/management activities, suggest potential system configuration changes or lateral movement attempts. The presence of cmdkey.exe listing credentials and Winlogbeat file creation in user directories adds context for further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
