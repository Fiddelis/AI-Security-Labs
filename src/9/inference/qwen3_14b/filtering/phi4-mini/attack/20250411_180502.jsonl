{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not a red flag yet. But then I see a powershell.exe process with a command line that starts another process using a batch file. The path here is \"C:\\\\pacote_comum\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". Wait, the use of \"..\\\\\" might be a directory traversal attempt. But I need to check if that's actually malicious or just a normal path. Sometimes legitimate scripts use such paths, but it's something to note.\n\nThen there are several events about powershell.exe loading images, like clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET Framework. That's normal. But then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1\". Creating and deleting a temporary script file could be part of normal operations, but if it's being used to execute malicious code, that's a problem. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to PowerShell execution policies, possibly indicating a test or legitimate activity.\n\nThere are also multiple events where powershell.exe is involved in registry changes and process accesses. The registry events might be benign, but if there's a pattern of modifying critical keys, that's suspicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified. \n\nLooking further, there are several instances of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's internal operations or event logs, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The command lines show starting various batch files, but the paths are obfuscated with \"..\\\\\" which could be an attempt to hide the actual location. However, without knowing the actual paths, it's hard to determine if they're malicious.\n\nOther processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe having registry events are probably normal. But the repeated registry value sets by powershell.exe might be worth investigating. Also, the fact that there are multiple network connections from chrome.exe, while normal, could be part of a larger pattern if combined with other activities.\n\nPutting it all together: there are some suspicious elements like the use of ..\\ in paths, temporary script creation, and multiple registry changes. However, none of the events clearly indicate a security breach. The activities could be part of legitimate operations, especially if the scripts are part of software installation or updates. But the presence of these events might warrant further investigation to rule out potential threats. So, I'd lean towards this being interesting enough for a security team to look into more deeply, but not a clear-cut attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system behavior and potentially suspicious activities. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activities**\n- **Chrome.exe**: Multiple DNS queries and network connections are typical for a web browser.\n- **PowerShell.exe**: Loading legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and temporary script creation\/deletion (`__PSScriptPolicyTest*.ps1`) could be part of routine operations or testing.\n- **Registry Events**: Modifications by benign processes (e.g., `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`) are likely unrelated to malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Obfuscated Paths in PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Example: `C:\\\\pacote_comum\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat`  \n     The use of `..\\\\` (directory traversal) may indicate an attempt to obscure the true path of the executed script. While not definitively malicious, this warrants scrutiny to verify if the resolved path points to a legitimate or suspicious location.\n\n2. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple entries involving `Registry value set`, `Process accessed`, and `Image loaded` events could hint at PowerShell being used for system manipulation. However, without context (e.g., specific registry keys modified or unexpected DLLs loaded), this remains inconclusive.\n\n3. **Temporary Script File**:\n   - The creation and deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest*.ps1` in the Temp directory might relate to PowerShell execution policy testing. While this could be benign, it could also be a precursor to executing malicious scripts if the file is later used for unauthorized tasks.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Interactions**:\n   - The combination of `Pipe Created` events (e.g., by `chrome.exe`) and registry modifications by multiple processes may suggest inter-process communication or lateral movement, though no direct evidence of exploitation is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch **does not contain clear evidence of a security breach**, but it **raises enough red flags** to warrant further investigation. Key steps for analysis include:\n- Verifying the resolved paths of obfuscated scripts (e.g., `objeto_padrao_script.bat`).\n- Checking the content of the temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest*.ps1`) for malicious payloads.\n- Correlating PowerShell activity with user behavior or system changes (e.g., registry modifications).\n- Assessing whether the observed network activity from `chrome.exe` aligns with known legitimate traffic patterns.\n\n**Recommendation**: Flag the logs for deeper analysis by a security team, focusing on PowerShell-related events and obfuscated paths."}

First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nMost of the events are about Chrome.exe and PowerShell doing normal tasks like registry value sets, image loads, and file creations. But wait, there's a few things that stand out. Let me check each entry again.\n\nLooking at the fourth event: the command line for powershell.exe is executing a batch file from a path that has \"registro_temporario\" and \"componente_padrao_script.bat\". The path seems a bit odd with the \"..\\\\entrada_comum\" part, which might be a directory traversal. That could be a red flag.\n\nThen, there's an entry where powershell.exe loads urlmon.dll from System32. That's a legitimate DLL, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, another event shows chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of Windows Defender, so that's normal.\n\nWait, there's a file creation by powershell.exe at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\componente_principal.txt\" and another at \"elemento_base.txt\". Creating files in Downloads might not be suspicious, but if they're part of a larger pattern, it could be.\n\nAlso, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads folder. That's a log shipper, so maybe that's just normal operation. But the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes by PowerShell and Chrome might indicate something.\n\nBut most of the events are just normal processes. Chrome doing registry changes is common. However, the combination of multiple registry value sets and file creations, especially with PowerShell executing scripts from possibly temporary directories, might suggest some automated task or script execution. \n\nBut are there any clear signs of malicious activity? The paths mentioned don't look like typical malicious paths, but the repeated registry changes and file creations could be part of a benign process. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used to run batch files from a path that includes \"..\\\\entrada_comum\" might be an attempt to access parent directories, which could be a sign of trying to access files outside the intended directory. \n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple entries with the same process and task, which might be normal for a legitimate process. However, the presence of both registry modifications and file creations could be part of a larger attack, but without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch has some suspicious elements but not definitive proof of malicious activity. The confidence level is moderate. I would classify this as INTERESTING because there are potential indicators that warrant further investigation, even though they might be benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and Chrome processes performing registry modifications and file creations, including execution of batch files from paths with potential directory traversal (e.g., '..\\\\entrada_comum'). While some activities (e.g., loading amsi.dll) are legitimate, the combination of registry changes, file creation in user directories, and PowerShell script execution warrants further investigation for potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
