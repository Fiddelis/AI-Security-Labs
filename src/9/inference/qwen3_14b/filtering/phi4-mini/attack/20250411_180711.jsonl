{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here. The first thing I notice is that there are several entries with the same PowerShell command line. Let me parse that command line.\n\nThe PowerShell script is taking a plaintext string, which seems to be \"Path\\n----\\nC:\\Users\\victim\", encoding it to bytes using UTF8. Then it's using a key \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\" and performing a bitwise XOR on each byte of the plaintext with the corresponding byte from the key (repeating the key as needed). After encrypting, it converts the resulting bytes back to a string and sends it via a POST request to example.com.\n\nNow, the fact that this is happening multiple times (the first seven entries are the same command) might be significant. Also, the task in the winlog is 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' which might be related to Windows Event Log tasks. But the key thing here is the PowerShell command itself.\n\nThe XOR encryption here is a simple obfuscation technique. The attacker is trying to hide the data being sent. The data being sent is the path \"C:\\Users\\victim\", which could be sensitive information. Sending this to example.com might be part of exfiltrating data. However, example.com is a placeholder, so it's unclear if it's a real malicious server or just a test.\n\nLooking at the other entries, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new, which is a configuration file for Winlogbeat, a log shipper. That might be part of setting up data collection, but not necessarily malicious. Then there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData, which could be related to persistence, but again, not necessarily malicious without more context.\n\nThe other entries are about registry value set, which could be part of configuring something, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, the repeated PowerShell commands that are encrypting and sending data to a server are suspicious. Even though the server is example.com, the act of encrypting and exfiltrating user path data might be part of a larger attack. The repetition of the same command multiple times could indicate a script that's running multiple times, which might be part of a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nBut wait, the user might be testing or using this for legitimate purposes. However, given that it's sending data to a server, and the encryption is a form of obfuscation, it's more likely to be part of a malicious activity. The fact that the same command is logged multiple times suggests that it's not a one-off event but part of ongoing activity.\n\nSo, putting this together, the logs indicate potential data exfiltration through encrypted channels. Even though the destination is example.com, which is a common placeholder, the pattern is concerning. The other logs about file creation and registry changes might be unrelated, but the PowerShell activity is a red flag.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate **potential data exfiltration** through a PowerShell script that encrypts and sends user path information to a server (`example.com`). Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Commands**:\n   - **Command**: A script that:\n     - Encrypts the string `\"Path\\n----\\nC:\\Users\\victim\"` using XOR with a static key (`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`).\n     - Sends the encrypted result via a POST request to `example.com`.\n   - **Frequency**: Appears **7 times** in the logs (same command line), suggesting **repeated execution** (possibly part of a script or automated process).\n\n2. **Obfuscation via XOR**:\n   - The use of XOR encryption is a **common obfuscation technique** to hide sensitive data (e.g., file paths) before exfiltration. This could be part of **data theft** or **command-and-control (C2) communication**.\n\n3. **Destination Server**:\n   - The target `example.com` is a **placeholder** (often used in examples or testing). This raises concerns about **real-world malicious activity**, as the attacker may have replaced it with a real C2 server in a production environment.\n\n---\n\n### **Other Log Entries**\n- **File Creation**:\n  - A `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file is created in the `Downloads` directory. This could be **legitimate** (e.g., configuring Winlogbeat for log collection), but if unexpected, it might indicate **tooling setup** for further attacks.\n- **Registry Value Set**:\n  - A registry change is logged, which could be **persistence mechanism** (e.g., adding a startup entry), though no malicious intent is confirmed here.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **High Risk**:\n  - The repeated PowerShell script with **data exfiltration** is a **strong indicator of malicious activity** (e.g., data theft, C2 communication).\n  - The use of XOR encryption suggests **efforts to evade detection**.\n- **Moderate Risk**:\n  - The Winlogbeat file and registry changes could be **legitimate** but should be investigated for context (e.g., user intent, system configuration).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the PowerShell Script**:\n   - Check if the script is part of **legitimate tools** (e.g., testing, monitoring) or if it's **malicious** (e.g., data exfiltration).\n   - Analyze the destination server (`example.com`) to confirm if it's a **real C2 endpoint**.\n\n2. **Monitor for Data Exfiltration**:\n   - Use network monitoring tools to **inspect traffic to `example.com`** and confirm if sensitive data is being sent.\n\n3. **Audit File and Registry Changes**:\n   - Verify the purpose of the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file and the registry modification. Ensure they are **intended by the user**.\n\n4. **Check for Persistence**:\n   - Investigate the `StartupProfileData` file to confirm if it's related to **malicious persistence** (e.g., startup scripts).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malicious data exfiltration** via a PowerShell script, even though the destination is a placeholder. Immediate investigation is required to confirm whether this is part of a **real attack** or a **test environment**."}

First, I notice that several processes are involved, like RuntimeBroker.exe, powershell.exe, notepad.exe, and others. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, and File created.\n\nNow, the main thing that stands out is the number of times powershell.exe is appearing. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. Let me check if there are any suspicious commands. Oh, there's one entry where the command line is \"Remove-Item\" with a path that seems a bit odd: \"C:\\\\objeto_temporario\\\\objeto_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\registro_auxiliar\\\\pacote_padrao_script.bat\". The path has a lot of directories with names that don't look standard, which might be obfuscation. Also, the use of \"Remove-Item\" with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore could be an attempt to delete files without causing errors, which might be part of cleaning up after some activity.\n\nAnother thing is the File created event by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a file in the Downloads directory might be normal, but it's worth noting. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell command. Even though there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, the obfuscated path, and the deletion command raises some flags. \n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious image loads. The chrome.exe entries loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll seem normal because those are legitimate Windows Defender files. The svchost.exe and other system processes doing registry changes might be normal too, but when combined with the PowerShell activity, it could indicate something more.\n\nOverall, while not all events are clearly malicious, the presence of the suspicious PowerShell command and the multiple accesses suggest that this batch might be worth investigating further.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for powershell.exe referencing system files like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. These are legitimate .NET files, so that's probably normal. But then there's a file created in the Downloads folder, which might be okay, but not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThen I see several 'Registry value set' events from chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but the repetition might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nLooking further, there are several 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events involving temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating and then deleting temporary files is common, especially in scripts. But the filenames like __PSScriptPolicyTest... might be related to PowerShell script execution. \n\nThen there are multiple 'Remove-Item' commands in the command_line fields. These commands are deleting various .bat files across different directories. The paths have a pattern where they're going up two directories (using ..\\), which might be an attempt to delete files in parent directories. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore suggests the script is trying to delete files without prompting for confirmation or handling errors, which is often seen in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there's a 'Pipe Created' event for powershell.exe, which could be part of normal operations, but combined with the deletion commands, it might indicate some automated process. \n\nThe repetition of similar events, especially the multiple deletions and registry changes, might indicate a script or malware trying to clean up after itself. The fact that PowerShell is involved in these operations is notable, as PowerShell is often used in attacks for its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, temporary files are often created and deleted during normal operations. But the combination of multiple deletions, registry changes, and the use of PowerShell with forceful deletion might be suspicious. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of malicious intent. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7. The justification would be the multiple suspicious file deletions and registry modifications via PowerShell, which could be indicative of an attack or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Deletion Commands**:\n   - Multiple `Remove-Item` commands in the `command_line` fields attempt to delete `.bat` files across various directories (e.g., `C:\\componente_principal\\pacote_comum\\..\\elemento_temporario\\tarefa_padrao_script.bat`). \n   - The use of `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` suggests an attempt to bypass user confirmation or error handling, common in malicious scripts for cleanup or evasion.\n\n2. **Directory Traversal in File Paths**:\n   - Paths like `..\\elemento_temporario` indicate attempts to access parent directories, which could be an attempt to delete files outside the immediate working directory, potentially hiding malicious activity.\n\n3. **Unusual File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n   - Files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest...` in `AppData\\Local\\Temp` and `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` may indicate PowerShell script execution or persistence mechanisms, which could be benign but are often exploited in attacks.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Repeated `Registry value set` events from `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` could signal attempts to modify system behavior or inject malicious configurations, though further context is needed to confirm.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation and Process Access**:\n   - The `Pipe Created` event and `Process accessed` logs might indicate inter-process communication or lateral movement, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile some activities (e.g., temporary file creation\/deletion) are common, the **repetition of deletion commands, directory traversal, and registry modifications** via PowerShell raises concerns about potential malicious intent. These patterns are often seen in post-exploitation phases of attacks (e.g., cleanup, persistence). \n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate further by checking:\n- The source of the PowerShell scripts (e.g., file hashes, parent processes).\n- Whether the deleted `.bat` files are associated with legitimate workflows or malicious payloads.\n- Registry changes for signs of persistence or configuration tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Judgment**:\n- **Verdict**: `INTERESTING` (requires deeper analysis).\n- **Confidence**: 0.7 (moderate risk due to suspicious patterns, but not definitive proof of malicious activity)."}

Not suspicious on its own. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. But multiple entries of powershell and cmd.exe might be normal, but combined with other actions?\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that uses sc.exe to stop and delete services named \"objeto_temporario\" and \"estrutura_secundario\". Those names look like they could be obfuscated or generated by malware. Deleting services might be part of a cleanup process after exploitation.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe trying to delete a hidden file in the temp directory. Deleting hidden files could be an attempt to remove evidence. Also, the use of \"del \/A:H\" suggests trying to remove files that are hidden, which is not typical in normal operations.\n\nThe image loaded events show that powershell.exe is loading several .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them might be normal if PowerShell is using .NET features. However, if PowerShell is being used to execute malicious code, these DLLs could be part of that process.

That seems normal because Windows Defender might have legitimate DLLs. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. PowerShell scripts in Temp are often used by attackers, so that's a red flag. Then the same file is deleted, which could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nNext, there's winlogbeat creating a new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, but creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration changes, but not necessarily malicious. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" might indicate some automated processes, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line that runs 'powershell.exe & {}', which is an empty script.

That's another suspicious action. The use of 'del \/f \/q \/s' is forceful and quiet, which is often used in malicious scripts to remove files without prompting.\n\nThere are multiple instances of PowerShell trying to remove a key.log file from Temp, which might be part of deleting logs. The 'Registry value set' events could indicate changes to the registry, which is common in persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of PowerShell creating and deleting files in Temp, along with cmd.exe deleting files, might indicate an attacker trying to execute scripts and then clean up. The multiple 'Process accessed' events and registry changes could be signs of an ongoing attack. However, some of these events could be benign, like legitimate scripts or configuration changes. But the combination of creating, deleting files in Temp, and using cmd and PowerShell in ways that are often associated with attacks makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is moderate because while some events are suspicious, others could be normal.

This pattern (create\/delete) is common in attacks to execute payloads and erase traces.\n\n2. **Cmd.exe File Deletion**:\n   - `cmd.exe` deletes `modulo_base.exe` and `unidade_auxiliar.exe` from `%TEMP%` using forceful, quiet commands (`\/f \/q \/s`). This behavior is often seen in malware to remove evidence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` could indicate attempts to modify system behavior (e.g., persistence mechanisms or configuration changes).\n\n4. **Empty PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Repeated execution of `powershell.exe & {}` (empty script blocks) may indicate testing or placeholder activity, potentially masking malicious commands.\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Windows Defender DLL**: The initial image load from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsDefender` is legitimate.\n- **Winlogbeat Configuration**: The creation of a `.yml.new` file by `winlogbeat` is consistent with configuration updates.\n- **Whoami.exe**: Execution of `whoami.exe` is a standard diagnostic tool.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs contain **mixed signals**. While some activities (e.g., file creation\/deletion in `%TEMP%`, registry changes) align with attack patterns, others (e.g., Windows Defender, Winlogbeat) are benign. The **combination of suspicious actions** (e.g., deletion of files in `%TEMP%`, empty PowerShell scripts) raises concerns about potential malicious activity. \n\n**Recommendation**: Further analysis is required to correlate these events with system behavior, check for lateral movement, and validate the intent of the scripts.

Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell is running a command to remove a file named key.log from the temporary directory. The error action is set to ignore, which might be a way to prevent errors if the file doesn't exist. That's a bit suspicious because deleting files, especially in temp directories, could be part of cleaning up after some activity.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about PowerShell processes being created, accessed, and having registry values set. Also, image loads are happening, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are .NET-related DLLs, which are normal for PowerShell, but maybe the frequency here is high? There's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory, which could be part of executing a script. The file names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_... might be related to PowerShell script execution, but the deletion after creation is a red flag. \n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user identity, but if that's the only thing happening, it's not bad. However, when combined with the PowerShell activities, maybe it's part of a larger operation. \n\nLooking at the command lines, the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times, which might be part of a script that's trying to remove files. The fact that there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events could indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not standard, maybe through some advanced features or modules. \n\nAlso, the registry value sets might be changing configurations, which could be part of persistence or modifying system settings. The image loads include some .NET components, which is normal, but if there's an unusual DLL being loaded, that's a concern. However, the ones listed here are standard. \n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes, file creation and deletion in temp directories, registry changes, and image loads. While some of these are normal, the combination could indicate that someone is using PowerShell for tasks that are typically associated with malicious activities, like cleaning up logs or executing scripts without leaving traces. The repeated attempts to remove key.log might be trying to erase evidence. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, like downloading files from the internet or executing malicious code. It's more about the behavior patterns. The confidence level might be around 0.6 or 0.7 because it's not conclusive, but the combination of events is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not overstepping. The key points are the file deletion, multiple PowerShell processes, and registry changes.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **File Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - A PowerShell process attempts to delete `key.log` from the temporary directory with `ErrorAction Ignore`. This could indicate **evidence cleanup** after an operation (e.g., script execution, log tampering).\n\n2. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell processes being created, accessed, and modifying registry values. This could signal **script-based operations** or **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry modifications for persistence).\n\n3. **Unusual File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` is created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. This pattern is often seen in **PowerShell script execution** or **sandbox evasion techniques**.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Repeated \"Registry value set\" events may indicate **configuration changes** (e.g., enabling remote access, disabling security features) or **persistence** (e.g., adding startup entries).\n\n5. **DLL Loads**:\n   - While loading .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is normal for PowerShell, the frequency and context (combined with other suspicious events) could hint at **exploitation of PowerShell for advanced tasks** (e.g., code injection, remote execution).\n\n6. **\"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - These events may indicate **non-standard PowerShell usage** (e.g., using advanced features like modules, providers, or remoting), which could be leveraged for malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal Behavior**:\n- **`whoami.exe`**: A benign tool for checking user identity.\n- **.NET DLL Loads**: Common in PowerShell operations.\n- **Script Testing Files**: Temporary files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` may be part of legitimate testing or debugging.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe combination of **file deletion, registry modifications, and repetitive PowerShell activity** raises **moderate concern**. While these events could be part of legitimate troubleshooting or testing, the **pattern of cleanup and registry changes** is consistent with **malicious behavior** (e.g., post-exploitation activities, persistence setup). \n\n**Recommendation**:  \nFurther investigation is needed, including:\n- Analyzing the full context of PowerShell commands (e.g., script content, network activity).\n- Checking for unauthorized registry changes or persistence mechanisms.\n- Correlating with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity).\n\n**Confidence Level**: **Medium (60-70%)** – Suspicious but not conclusive."}

It's not a clear-cut attack, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe process accesses combined with a registry modification event suggest potential malicious activity, though not definitively confirmed. The presence of 'whoami.exe' executions is normal but adds to the pattern of process monitoring.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
