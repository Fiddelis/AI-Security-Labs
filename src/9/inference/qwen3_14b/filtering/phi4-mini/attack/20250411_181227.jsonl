The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with the process \"powershell.exe\" and command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The command lines use PowerShell cmdlets like New-ScheduledTaskAction, New-ScheduledTaskTrigger, etc., which are part of the ScheduledTasks module. The tasks are set to run calc.exe at logon, which is a bit suspicious because calc.exe is a benign application, but creating multiple scheduled tasks with administrative privileges might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the parameters, the Principal is set to \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" with RunLevel Highest. That means the task runs with the highest privileges, which could be a sign of someone trying to escalate privileges or execute code with admin rights. Also, the tasks are named things like \"unidade_ativo$object\" and \"tarefa_base$object\", which might be obfuscated or have unusual names, which is common in malware.\n\nThen, there are other events like registry value sets, process accesses, and image loads. The image loads include mscoree.dll, which is related to .NET, and MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. The file creation and deletion in the Temp directory might be part of script execution that's trying to clean up after itself, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nHowever, I should check if these are legitimate activities. Scheduled tasks created by administrators might be part of normal system management. But the repetition of creating multiple tasks with the same pattern, along with the use of PowerShell scripts that are created and then deleted, could indicate malicious activity. The presence of multiple ProcessCreate, ImageLoad, and FileCreate events related to PowerShell suggests that a script is being executed, possibly with obfuscated commands.\n\nAlso, the fact that the script is created in the Temp directory and then deleted might be an attempt to avoid leaving traces. The use of \"calc.exe\" as the action is a classic example of a benign payload being used as a test, but in the context of multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, it's more suspicious.\n\nI should also note that some of the events are from chrome.exe, but those seem less concerning compared to the PowerShell activities. The image loaded from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might be a false positive, but combined with other events, it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nIn conclusion, the multiple scheduled task creations with administrative privileges, the use of PowerShell scripts that are transient, and the combination of various security-related events (like file creation\/deletion and image loading) make this log suspicious. It's likely related to a security incident, possibly an attempt to execute code with elevated privileges or a script-based attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate **potentially malicious activity** involving PowerShell scripts and scheduled tasks, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Malicious PowerShell Script Execution:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell scripts creating **scheduled tasks** with elevated privileges (`RunLevel Highest`) under the `BUILTIN\\Administrators` group. These tasks execute `calc.exe` (a benign utility) at logon, which is **unusual** and may be a **stealthy obfuscation technique** to test or bypass security policies.\n   - Example command line:\n     ```\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"; $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon; $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest; Register-ScheduledTask tarefa_geral$object\n     ```\n\n2. **Transient Script Files:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory and immediately deleted, suggesting **efforts to avoid detection** (common in malware).\n\n3. **Unusual File and Module Loads:**\n   - **`mscoree.dll`** (used for .NET execution) and **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender component) are loaded, which could indicate **script execution** or **antivirus evasion**.\n   - The presence of **`mscorlib.ni.dll`** (a .NET assembly) suggests **code execution via .NET**.\n\n4. **Repetitive Events:**\n   - Multiple `ProcessCreate`, `ImageLoad`, and `FileCreate` events tied to `powershell.exe` and transient files point to **automated or scripted activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Suspicious:**\n- **Privilege Escalation:** Tasks are configured to run with **highest privileges**, which is highly unusual for routine operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** The use of obfuscated task names (e.g., `tarefa_geral$object`) and transient files suggests **malware evasion**.\n- **Lateral Movement\/Persistence:** Creating scheduled tasks with admin rights could be an attempt to **establish persistence** or **execute payloads** under elevated privileges.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Analyze the PowerShell Script:**\n   - Recover the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) from disk if possible.\n   - Check for encoded or obfuscated commands (e.g., `Invoke-Expression`, `IEX`, or base64 strings).\n\n2. **Check for Additional Malware:**\n   - Scan the system for **unauthorized binaries** or **registry modifications** related to the scheduled tasks.\n   - Monitor network traffic for **exfiltration** or **C2 communication**.\n\n3. **Review User Activity:**\n   - Identify the user (`fiddelis`) who executed the script and check for **unusual login patterns** or **privilege escalation**.\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Look for **failed login attempts**, **unauthorized access**, or **system changes** around the same timeframe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malicious activity** involving PowerShell-based script execution, privilege escalation, and persistence mechanisms. Immediate investigation and mitigation (e.g., isolating the affected system, removing scheduled tasks, and scanning for malware) are recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSON events. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event. The process is powershell.exe with a command line that's creating a scheduled task. The command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, triggers at logon, and sets the principal to Administrators with highest run level. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with admin rights might be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism. But wait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows application, so maybe it's just a test. However, the user is an admin, so maybe that's why.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with registry value set events. That's common, maybe just normal operations, but not sure yet. Then there are a bunch of \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with process None. That could be a red flag if they're indicating remote code execution, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe they're part of a legitimate remote management tool, but the repetition might be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, another powershell.exe event similar to the first one, but with a different task name \"unidade_comum\". Then, WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's the Windows Management Instrumentation provider, which is normal, but maybe loading a specific DLL could be part of a compromise. However, taskschd.dll is a legitimate system file.\n\nNext, svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory, which might be related to the scheduled tasks mentioned earlier. Then, powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for PowerShell profiles, but again, could be part of malicious activity.\n\nAnother entry is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's a legitimate process. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes might indicate some configuration changes.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious points are the scheduled task creation with admin rights, the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events, and the file creations in system directories. However, some of these could be benign. The confidence is moderate because while there are signs of potential malicious activity, there's not enough evidence to confirm it definitively. The presence of both legitimate and suspicious activities makes it a bit ambiguous. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with a confidence around 0.7 or so.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events, and file creations in system directories that could indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activity. However, some events (e.g., Chrome, svchost) appear benign.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. The first six entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set task. That's a lot of the same process and the same event type. Now, chrome.exe doing registry changes might not be inherently bad, but repeated registry modifications could be a sign of something. Maybe a malicious script or an extension changing settings. However, I need to check if there's any other activity that might indicate a problem.\n\nThen, the seventh event is a DNS query from chrome.exe. DNS queries are normal, but if there's a pattern here or if it's pointing to suspicious domains, that could be an issue. However, the log doesn't specify the domain, so I can't say for sure yet.\n\nThe eighth event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of its setup. The path seems to be a standard installation directory, so this might be a legitimate activity.\n\nThe ninth event is powershell.exe creating a file named \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The filename is in Spanish, which might be a red flag, but not necessarily. However, if this is part of a script that's downloading or executing something, that could be concerning. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, which could be normal if it's updating its own settings, but repeated changes might be suspicious. The PowerShell event creating a file could be benign, but the name is a bit odd. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The other events don't show any obvious signs of compromise. The confidence is a bit low because while there are some unusual activities, they could also be legitimate. So, I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence, as there are some anomalies that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe registry modification events combined with a PowerShell-created file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt' (Spanish for 'auxiliary object') suggest potential benign or suspicious activity warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
