Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event is about powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the Downloads folder. That's a normal user activity, maybe just saving a file. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome updating its settings is common, but multiple registry changes in a short time might be worth noting. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate tool to check user identity, so probably harmless.\n\nNow, looking at the powershell.exe entries with command lines that include 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' and logging to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag. Keystroke logging is typically associated with keyloggers, which are malicious. The script is being executed multiple times from different paths, which might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing locations.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. While some are legitimate, the repeated loading might be part of the malicious script's operation.\n\nThe FileCreate and FileDelete events for temporary files could be part of the malware's lifecycle, creating and then deleting logs to avoid leaving traces. The PipeCreated event might be used for inter-process communication, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts, multiple registry changes, and file operations that create and delete temporary files suggest malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points towards a potential security threat. The confidence is high because the keystroke logging is a clear indicator of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in temporary directories, combined with file creation\/deletion events and repeated registry modifications, strongly indicate keystlogging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command line that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is logging keystrokes to a temporary file. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically used for capturing sensitive information like passwords. The path mentioned is C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The presence of such a script in a temporary directory might be part of an attack, especially if it's being executed from there.\n\nAnother event shows the same script being run again, but with a different path: C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition could indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure the script runs multiple times or is testing different paths to avoid detection.\n\nThen there's an event where the process is None, but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file path is C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This might be related to the same script being executed remotely, which is another concerning point. If a script is being executed remotely without proper authorization, that's a clear sign of potential malicious activity.\n\nOther events involve file creation by PowerShell and Winlogbeat. However, Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, so those might be normal operations. The svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization directory seems standard as well, but I should check if those files are expected. The presence of multiple file creations by PowerShell could be part of the attack's persistence mechanism.\n\nThe registry value set events are a bit generic, but combined with the PowerShell activities, they might indicate changes to the system's configuration to maintain access or hide the attack.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is known for keystroke logging, along with remote command execution and file creation in non-standard directories, suggests a potential security incident. The confidence level is high because these activities are commonly associated with malware or spyware attempts. However, I should consider if there's any possibility of false positives, like legitimate scripts with similar names. But given the context and the nature of the commands, it's more likely malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' (a known keystroke logging script) with temporary file outputs, combined with suspicious file creation events and potential remote command execution, indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
