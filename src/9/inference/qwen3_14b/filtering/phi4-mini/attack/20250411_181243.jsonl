{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and created. The 'ProcessCreate' events for powershell.exe are normal, but looking at the command line in one of them, there's a long string with commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and others. These commands seem to be gathering system information, like user details, group memberships, and checking stored credentials. That's suspicious because such commands could be part of an attacker enumerating the system to find vulnerabilities or gather information for further attacks.\n\nThen there are events related to image loading, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are .NET runtime components, so loading them might be normal if PowerShell is using .NET. But combined with the other activities, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nAnother point is the deletion of a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1). Deleting temporary files isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a script that was used to perform malicious actions, that could be a sign of cleanup.\n\nThere's also a 'net1.exe' process being created with the command 'net1 user'. Wait, 'net1.exe' isn't a standard Windows executable. The legitimate 'net.exe' is used for network commands, but 'net1.exe' might be a typo or a malicious file trying to mimic it. That's a red flag because it could be a renamed malicious binary.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events. These might be related to the Windows Event Log system or other services, but if they're appearing in large numbers or with unusual parameters, they could indicate something's wrong. However, in this case, the entries don't show any obvious malicious parameters, but the repetition of the same command line in multiple events might suggest automated or scripted activity.\n\nThe presence of 'whoami.exe' is normal; it's a standard tool for checking user context. However, when combined with the other PowerShell activities, it could be part of a larger reconnaissance effort.\n\nAlso, the 'File created' event for winlogbeat.yml.new might be related to a log shipping tool, but if it's in a user's Downloads folder and not part of a known legitimate process, it could be a sign of an attacker setting up their tools.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious elements are the PowerShell commands gathering system info, the presence of 'net1.exe' (which is not standard), and the deletion of a temporary script. These activities are commonly seen in initial stages of cyber attacks where an attacker is trying to understand the target environment and prepare for further exploitation. Even though not all activities are definitively malicious, the combination of these events makes this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several suspicious patterns indicative of potential reconnaissance or malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Enumeration Commands:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a script with commands like:\n     - `net user` (lists user accounts)\n     - `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember` (gathers user\/group details)\n     - `cmdkey.exe \/list` (checks stored credentials)\n     - `get-childitem` (explores file system)\n   - These commands are typical of **system enumeration** during initial access phases of an attack, aiming to gather sensitive information.\n\n2. **Unusual Executable: `net1.exe`:**\n   - A process named `net1.exe` (not a standard Windows tool) executed `net1 user`. This is highly suspicious:\n     - `net.exe` is legitimate, but `net1.exe` is likely a **malicious or typo-malformed binary** mimicking `net.exe` to evade detection.\n\n3. **Script File Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1`) was deleted after execution. This is consistent with **post-exploitation cleanup** to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Unusual File Creation:**\n   - A file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new` was created in a user's Downloads directory. While Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipping tool, its presence in a user's Downloads folder without clear context may indicate **tool deployment by an attacker**.\n\n5. **Repeated Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events with identical command lines suggest **automated or scripted execution**, potentially part of a larger attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Analysis:**\n- The combination of **PowerShell enumeration**, **non-standard executables**, and **file manipulation** aligns with tactics used in **initial access**, **reconnaissance**, and **privilege escalation** phases of cyber attacks.\n- The use of `net1.exe` (a likely typo\/malicious variant of `net.exe`) and the deletion of a temporary script file are **high-risk indicators** requiring immediate investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `net1.exe` process:**\n   - Verify the file's origin, hash, and digital signature.\n   - Check for unexpected modifications to system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`).\n\n2. **Analyze the deleted PowerShell script:**\n   - Recover the file (if possible) to examine its contents for malicious payloads.\n   - Check logs for other deleted or modified files in the same directory.\n\n3. **Audit Winlogbeat configuration:**\n   - Confirm if Winlogbeat was intentionally deployed and if the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate setup.\n\n4. **Monitor for lateral movement:**\n   - Check for additional suspicious processes, network connections, or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The presence of enumeration commands, non-standard executables, and file manipulation suggests potential malicious intent. Further analysis of binaries, logs, and system integrity is critical to confirm whether this is part of an ongoing attack."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event shows a PowerShell command that's doing a bunch of things: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups, which is a common initial step in an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of PowerShell being created and accessed. That's normal, but when combined with the initial command, it might indicate someone is trying to explore the system. The file creations in the Downloads folder and AppData might be part of setting up something, like dropping files or configuration files. The presence of winlogbeat suggests maybe someone is trying to install a log shipper, which could be for exfiltrating data. \n\nThere's also a Calculator.exe and urlmon.dll being loaded, which might be benign, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be a red flag. However, the main suspicious parts are the PowerShell commands gathering system info and the file creations. But I need to check if there's a clear malicious intent here. The commands themselves aren't necessarily malicious, but the combination with multiple process creations and file writes might indicate an attacker probing the system. \n\nI should also note that some of the processes like whoami.exe and net.exe are standard utilities, but their use here in conjunction with PowerShell scripts could be part of a larger attack. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities could be legitimate, but the combination of these events is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., enumerating users\/groups, listing credentials, exploring file systems) combined with file creation in user directories and registry modifications, suggesting potential system reconnaissance or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
