{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the processes mentioned. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but when combined with other actions, it can be a red flag. Then there's 'sc.exe' creating a service called 'win32times' with a command that tries to start a script from 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The filenames have 'NonExistingScript' in them, which might be a typo or a way to hide the real script name. \n\nLooking at the command line for 'cmd.exe', it's using 'sc create' to set up a service with a binPath that includes starting a PowerShell script. That's unusual because services typically don't execute scripts directly. Also, the use of 'sc qc win32times' later on might be checking the service configuration, which could be part of an attempt to persist or modify the service.\n\nThere are multiple 'Registry value set' events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify registry keys for persistence. The 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' processes are normal, but the repeated registry events might be part of an attack. \n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' are normal, but if there's any unusual behavior with that DLL, it might be a concern. However, in this case, there's no indication of that. \n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably just part of the logging tool's operation, so that's likely benign. \n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious points are the use of 'sc.exe' to create a service that attempts to run non-existent PowerShell scripts, which could be an indicator of someone trying to execute malicious code or set up persistence. The repeated registry modifications and the presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd processes might be part of a larger attack. However, some of the events might be normal system activities. \n\nI think the confidence here is moderate. There are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of a security incident. So the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Use of 'sc.exe' to create a service ('win32times') with a command attempting to execute non-existent PowerShell scripts (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1). 2) Repeated 'Registry value set' events potentially indicating configuration changes. 3) Frequent 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which may suggest lateral movement or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all in JSONL format. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are about 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. There are eight entries where the task is 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. Then there are two entries where 'chrome.exe' loads images, one pointing to amsi.dll and another to MpOAV.dll. The last entry is about 'powershell.exe' being accessed.\n\nFirst, I need to check if these events are normal or suspicious. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe in some cases. However, multiple registry changes could be a red flag. Also, loading DLLs from system paths like System32 and ProgramData might be normal, but I should check if they're legitimate. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's probably okay. MpOAV.dll is also related to Windows Defender, so that's normal too. \n\nBut wait, the fact that chrome.exe is loading these DLLs might not be suspicious on its own. However, the combination of multiple registry changes and the process access by powershell.exe could indicate something. Powershell being accessed might be normal, but if it's being used for something malicious, that's a concern. \n\nHowever, the logs don't show any clear malicious activity. The events are all related to legitimate processes. Chrome modifying the registry might be part of its normal operations, especially if it's updating settings. The ImageLoad events are for legitimate DLLs. The ProcessAccess by powershell.exe might just be a normal process interaction. \n\nBut since there are multiple registry changes, maybe that's unusual. However, without more context or other suspicious events, it's hard to say. The classification should be based on whether there's enough evidence to warrant an investigation. Since the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity, but there are multiple registry changes, maybe it's borderline. However, the presence of legitimate DLLs and no other suspicious activities might mean it's not interesting. \n\nWait, but the user said to consider the combination of all events. If all events are normal, then it's not interesting. But if there's a pattern that's unusual, like a lot of registry changes by chrome.exe, that might be worth investigating. However, I'm not sure if that's a common occurrence. Maybe the user should check if chrome.exe is modifying the registry in unexpected ways. \n\nBut without more information, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to determine. The justification would be that multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be normal, but the presence of other events like ImageLoad and ProcessAccess might not be suspicious. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting enough for investigation. \n\nAlternatively, if the registry changes are in key areas, it could be a problem. But since the task is only about the Registry value set and no other details, it's hard to tell. So maybe the classification is 'NOT INTERESTING' because there's no clear malicious activity, just normal process behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal operations (registry modifications, DLL loading, process access) without indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
