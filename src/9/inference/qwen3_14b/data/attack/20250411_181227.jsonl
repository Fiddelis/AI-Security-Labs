{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the principal is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights and high privileges can be part of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe task names are varied, like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. But the pattern is consistent. Each is registering a scheduled task that runs calc.exe when a user logs on. Now, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but using it in this context might be a way to execute arbitrary code under admin rights. \n\nAlso, there are multiple events related to PowerShell, including registry value sets and process accesses. The ImageLoad events show loading of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. This might indicate that the PowerShell script is using .NET to perform actions, which is normal, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe fact that the tasks are being registered with high privileges and under Administrators group is suspicious. Normally, scheduled tasks might be set up for regular users, but here it's targeting admins. Also, the repetition of similar commands across different task names might be an attempt to create multiple backdoors or persistence points.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign explanation. Maybe it's a script that's legitimately creating tasks, but the use of calc.exe is odd. Usually, you'd see more meaningful executables. Also, the lack of other suspicious activities like network connections or file modifications might make this more likely to be a test or a benign script. But the combination of admin privileges and repeated task creation is still concerning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key points are: multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights, using PowerShell to create them, and loading .NET components. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Administrative Privileges**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `New-ScheduledTaskAction` to register tasks that execute `calc.exe` (a legitimate utility) under **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** with **`RunLevel Highest`**. \n   - While `calc.exe` is benign, the **high-privilege context** and **repetition of task creation** (e.g., \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc.) suggest **persistent access** or **privilege escalation** attempts. This is suspicious because:\n     - **`calc.exe`** is often used as a placeholder in malicious scripts to bypass detection (e.g., to execute arbitrary code via COM objects or PowerShell).\n     - **Administrators group** access is typically restricted, making this a red flag for **unauthorized elevation**.\n\n2. **.NET DLL Loads**:\n   - The logs show PowerShell loading **.NET runtime components** (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`). While normal for PowerShell, this could indicate:\n     - **Obfuscation or execution of malicious payloads** via .NET (e.g., using `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start` to execute hidden commands).\n     - **Code injection** or **exploitation of .NET vulnerabilities**.\n\n3. **Repetition and Automation**:\n   - The same PowerShell script is registered under **multiple task names**, suggesting **automation** or **multi-stage attacks** (e.g., establishing persistence across system reboots or user logins).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation**\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Tasks running as `Administrators` with `RunLevel Highest` could allow **unauthorized access to sensitive systems**.\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: Scheduled tasks are a common method for **malware to survive reboots** or **evade detection**.\n- **Behavioral Anomalies**: The use of `calc.exe` in this context is **unusual** and may mask **malicious payloads** (e.g., through COM object exploitation or PowerShell remoting).\n- **Lack of Context**: No logs show **network activity**, **file modifications**, or **user interaction**, which could indicate **incomplete data** or **early-stage malware**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Check Task Details**:\n   - Inspect the actual content of the registered tasks (e.g., via `schtasks \/query \/v`) to confirm if `calc.exe` is the only action or if hidden commands are embedded.\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Extract and deobfuscate the PowerShell code (e.g., using `Get-Command` or memory dumps) to identify **hidden payloads** or **malicious logic**.\n3. **Monitor .NET Activity**:\n   - Investigate if the loaded .NET DLLs are being used for **code execution** (e.g., via `System.Diagnostics.Process` or `System.Management.Automation`).\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for **network connections**, **credential access**, or **file modifications** that might indicate **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs exhibit **high-risk patterns** consistent with **malware persistence**, **privilege escalation**, or **initial exploitation**. This batch **requires immediate investigation** to confirm whether the activity is benign (e.g., a misconfigured script) or malicious (e.g., a backdoor)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender's directory. That seems normal because Windows Defender uses those DLLs. But then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp folder. That's a bit odd. Usually, creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of a script trying to execute something without leaving traces. The file name has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Deleting it right after could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but alone, it's not necessarily malicious. However, combined with other events, it might indicate something. Then, looking at the command line for a PowerShell process, there's a scheduled task being created with actions to run calc.exe. The trigger is set to run at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with high privileges. That's suspicious because creating a scheduled task that runs with admin rights could be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism. The user might be trying to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome does modify the registry for updates and settings, but multiple entries in a short time might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The rest of the logs have \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with the process field as None. That's concerning because it suggests that there are events indicating remote command execution, but the process isn't identified. That could be a sign of a compromise where an attacker is executing commands remotely, and the system isn't logging the process correctly, or it's a false positive.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities involving scheduled tasks with admin rights, the creation and deletion of a script file, and the remote command execution logs all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some entries might be legitimate (like Defender's DLLs), the combination of these events increases the likelihood of a security incident. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the presence of multiple suspicious actions warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including scheduled task creation with admin privileges, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and potential remote command execution events. These patterns suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event and note what's happening. The first event is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but loading a DLL from System32 might be normal. However, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen there are several entries with svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services. Multiple registry changes might be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys or adding unexpected entries, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there's an event where a process is executing a remote command, but the process name is None. That might mean the event doesn't have process information, which could be a sign of something evading detection. But I need to see if that's part of a pattern.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a common place for PowerShell profiles, so maybe legitimate. But creating files there could also be part of persistence mechanisms if done maliciously.\n\nAnother event is about Chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate DLLs related to Windows Defender and anti-malware. So that seems normal. But if there were unexpected paths or if the DLLs were from unusual locations, that would be suspicious.\n\nThen there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration changes, but again, without knowing the context, it's hard to tell. Similarly, PowerShell creating text files in the Downloads folder could be normal user activity.\n\nThe repeated registry events from Chrome.exe might be normal, but if they're modifying settings that aren't typical for Chrome, that could be an issue. Also, the DNS query event from Chrome might be normal browsing, but if it's querying suspicious domains, that's a problem. However, the event doesn't mention the domain, so I can't tell.\n\nPutting this all together, there are some events that could be benign, like normal process activities and file creations. However, the presence of multiple registry changes, the remote command execution (even if process info is missing), and the fact that some events involve processes that are typically used for legitimate purposes but could be abused might indicate something worth looking into. The confidence isn't extremely high because there's not enough evidence of malicious activity, but the combination of events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events include registry modifications by svchost.exe (commonly abused for persistence), execution of remote commands with no process context, and file creation in sensitive directories (e.g., PowerShell startup profiles). While some events (e.g., Chrome loading amsi.dll) are benign, the combination of unusual process activities and lack of clear legitimate context warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
