{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any suspicious patterns.\n\nStarting with the processes: there's a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is common, but when combined with other actions, it might be a red flag. Then, there's the use of reg.exe and REG ADD commands modifying the registry, specifically the Run keys under HKCU. That's a classic sign of someone trying to persist access by adding a registry entry that runs a malicious executable on startup.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one of the cmd.exe processes is adding a registry entry for \"estrutura_principal.exe\" and another for \"pacote_temporario.exe\". Those files are placed in C:\\Path, which isn't a standard system directory. That's suspicious. Also, the paths mentioned in the registry entries don't look like legitimate system paths, which could indicate malware.\n\nThen there's the file creation events. One is a .txt file, which might be benign, but the other is a .yml.new file related to winlogbeat. However, the presence of multiple file creations, especially with winlogbeat, might be part of the attacker's tools or data exfiltration. But the main concern here is the registry modifications and the use of cmd and PowerShell to make changes that persist across reboots.\n\nAlso, the repeated access to processes like PowerShell and the multiple registry events could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or execute commands that aren't normally allowed. The combination of these events—registry persistence, use of common tools for malicious purposes, and file creation in non-standard locations—suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nI should check if there's any indication of data exfiltration or lateral movement, but from the given logs, it's more about persistence. The confidence level would be around 0.85 because while there are clear signs of malicious behavior, without more context like network activity or actual malicious file hashes, it's not 100% certain. But the registry changes and the use of command-line tools for persistence are strong indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage, registry modifications to HKCU\\\\Run keys (indicating persistence attempts), and creation of non-standard executable paths (e.g., 'C:\\\\Path\\\\estrutura_principal.exe').
