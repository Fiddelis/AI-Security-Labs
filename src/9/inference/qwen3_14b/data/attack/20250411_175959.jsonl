{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of activity from chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's powershell.exe with several events.\n\nOne of the powershell.exe entries has a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used for enumerating system information, users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag because it looks like the attacker is gathering information about the system, which is a common step in privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nAlso, there are multiple image loads from .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so maybe PowerShell is using .NET for some operations. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but combined with other activities, it's worth checking.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be malicious. The repeated Provider Lifecycle events might be related to the script execution, but they're not inherently malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities, especially the command-line commands, suggest system enumeration. The temporary file creation and deletion could indicate an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. These behaviors are suspicious and warrant further investigation. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including system enumeration commands (net user, get-localgroup), temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET assemblies.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of powershell.exe activity. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. One entry has a command line with \"net user\", \"get-localuser\", \"get-localgroupmember\", \"cmdkey.exe \/list\", and other commands that list users, directories, and groups. That seems like someone is enumerating the system, which could be part of reconnaissance for an attack.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads folder, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious files. However, the filename here is .yml.new, which could be part of a configuration update, but I need to see more context.\n\nAnother process is powershell.exe creating a file called \"pacote_ativo.txt\". The name doesn't ring any immediate bells, but without knowing the content, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that PowerShell is creating files might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the other processes: net.exe and net1.exe running \"user\" commands. Net1.exe isn't a standard Windows executable; the correct one is net.exe. The presence of net1.exe might be a typo or a malicious binary trying to mimic a legitimate process. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there's the updater.exe process with a long command line that includes URLs and paths. It's part of Google's updater, but the command line seems a bit complex. However, the presence of \"--database\" and \"--url\" might be normal for an updater. Still, I need to check if there's anything unusual in the parameters.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets. Multiple entries here could indicate that Chrome is being configured, but if there are many such events, it might be part of a larger configuration change. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nThe events with \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" in the winlog task might relate to changes in user permissions or groups, which could be part of an attack. However, the process is listed as \"None\" here, which might mean that the event is from the system, not a specific process. That could be normal system activity, but combined with other events, it might indicate changes to user accounts or groups.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands that look like system enumeration, the presence of net1.exe (which might be a typo or malicious), and events related to user and group management. These could be signs of an attacker trying to gather information and modify permissions. However, some of these could be normal system activities. But given the combination, especially the net1.exe and the PowerShell commands, this batch might be worth investigating further. I should flag this as potentially interesting but note that more analysis is needed to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of key observations:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **PowerShell Enumeration Commands**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, and `dir C:\\Users`. These commands are commonly used for **system reconnaissance**, which could indicate an attacker gathering information about user accounts, groups, and credentials.\n\n2. **Unusual Process: `net1.exe`**:\n   - A process named `net1.exe` (not a standard Windows tool) is executing the `net user` command. This could be a **malicious binary** impersonating a legitimate tool (`net.exe`) or a typo in logging. The presence of a non-standard executable raises concerns.\n\n3. **File Creation by PowerShell**:\n   - A file named `pacote_ativo.txt` is created via PowerShell. While the filename is not inherently malicious, the use of PowerShell for file creation in conjunction with enumeration commands may warrant further investigation.\n\n4. **User\/Group Management Events**:\n   - Events labeled \"User Account Management\" and \"Security Group Management\" (with `process=None`) could indicate **changes to user permissions or group memberships**, which might be part of an attack lifecycle (e.g., privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **Normal\/System Activity**\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: The file `Crashpad` and `updater.log` related to Google's updater (`updater.exe`) appear to be part of legitimate software operations.\n- **Chrome Registry Updates**: Multiple `chrome.exe` entries involving registry changes are likely part of standard configuration or update processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**This batch is potentially interesting for investigation** due to:\n- **PowerShell-based enumeration** (common in initial access phases).\n- The presence of **`net1.exe`**, which may be a typo or malicious tool.\n- **User\/group management events** that could signal privilege manipulation.\n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Correlate these logs with other security telemetry (e.g., network traffic, file hashes of `net1.exe`, or `pacote_ativo.txt`).\n- Check if `net1.exe` is a legitimate process or a mimicry of `net.exe`.\n- Investigate the purpose of `pacote_ativo.txt` and its contents.\n\nWithout additional context, the activity is **not definitively malicious**, but it warrants further analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nMost of the entries are about 'Security Group Management' in winlog, but those don't have any process or file details. Maybe that's normal, but not sure yet. Then there's a few processes like SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Loading those DLLs might be okay, but if it's a malicious process, that could be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's a 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' running 'localgroup' commands. 'net1.exe' isn't a standard command; maybe a typo or a malicious binary. Then there's PowerShell creating files in the user's AppData directory, which is common for legitimate scripts but can also be used by malware. \n\nAlso, the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if it's part of a monitoring setup. But the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could indicate some configuration changes. \n\nThe 'MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe' is running with a command line that includes '\/installsource scheduler'. That might be part of a scheduled update, but I should check if that's expected. \n\nThere's also 'backgroundTaskHost.exe' loading urlmon.dll. Again, not sure if that's normal. \n\nI need to see if there's a pattern here. Multiple processes creating files, registry changes, and non-standard executables. However, some of these could be benign. The key is whether there's a combination of events that suggests malicious activity. \n\nThe presence of SDXHelper.exe loading DLLs, non-standard executables like net1.exe, and PowerShell creating files might be indicative of something. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that there are several events that are not standard and involve creating files and modifying the registry could be a sign of a potential security incident. \n\nConfidence is a bit low because some of these could be normal, but the combination of events does raise some flags. So, I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: non-standard processes (SDXHelper.exe, net1.exe), PowerShell creating files in user directories, and repeated registry modifications.
