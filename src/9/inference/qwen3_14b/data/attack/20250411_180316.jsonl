{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, and conhost.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost.exe and calc.exe, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe can be used for malicious activities.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks: Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created, Pipe Created, and Process Create. The ImageLoad events are pointing to urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files, but loading them from certain contexts might be suspicious. However, just loading them isn't necessarily bad.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's a bit odd because why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe trying to remove a process that's being used for something else. Also, there's a WMIC.exe process that's loading those DLLs. But again, WMIC is a legitimate tool, though often abused in attacks.\n\nAnother thing is the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be part of normal operations if it's a log file, but the name .yml.new suggests it's a configuration file being written, which could be part of setup or a potential attack if it's being tampered with.\n\nNow, checking for any patterns. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used, along with Registry events. The use of WMIC to delete processes might be part of a cleanup phase. Also, the ImageLoad events on system DLLs might be part of a legitimate process, but combined with other commands, it could be suspicious.\n\nHowever, I don't see any obvious signs of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or network activity. The events are mostly system-related and could be part of normal user activities or system maintenance. The presence of winlogbeat suggests that there's a monitoring tool in place, which might be normal.\n\nBut wait, the command line in one of the cmd.exe entries is deleting notepad.exe processes. That's unusual. Maybe the attacker is trying to remove a process that's being used for monitoring or something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, multiple Registry value sets could indicate changes to system settings, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch has some suspicious activities, but they might not be enough to confirm a security incident. The confidence isn't very high, but there's enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: 1) Use of WMIC.exe and cmd.exe to delete processes (potential cleanup of malicious activity). 2) ImageLoad events for system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) which could indicate evasion techniques. 3) winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file in user directory (possible log tampering). 4) Repeated Registry modifications and process injections that may indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and others. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. Now, I know that normal system operations might have some registry changes, but if there's a pattern or something suspicious, that's a red flag.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like someone is replacing the sethc.exe file, which is a known method used in attacks to replace the Sticky Keys utility with a malicious version. That's definitely suspicious.\n\nAnother entry has \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", which is deleting a scheduled task. While deleting tasks isn't inherently bad, if it's part of a larger attack, like removing evidence, that's concerning. Also, there's a mention of taskschd.dll being loaded, which is a legitimate file, but the context here might matter.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used, and registry values being set. While PowerShell is common, frequent access or modifications could indicate someone is trying to manipulate system settings. The repetition of certain commands and processes might suggest automated scripts or malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these events are normal. For example, chrome.exe modifying the registry could be part of its normal operation, but if it's doing it excessively or in unusual ways, that's a problem. The same goes for other processes. But the specific command line I mentioned earlier is a strong indicator of an attack.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of the sethc.exe replacement, multiple suspicious commands, and repeated registry modifications by potentially malicious processes. Even though some events might be benign, the combination here points towards a possible security incident. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including attempts to modify system files (e.g., replacing sethc.exe via cmd.exe), deletion of scheduled tasks, and repeated registry modifications by processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the logs, there are several processes involved: cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Image loaded, Process accessed, and File created. \n\nI notice that chrome.exe has entries where it loaded amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. But why would chrome.exe be loading these? That might be suspicious because normally these DLLs are part of the system's security features. However, if they're being loaded by a non-system process, that could indicate something's wrong. But maybe it's just a legitimate process interacting with Defender. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe appearing multiple times with tasks like Process accessed, Registry value set, and Image loaded. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The Image loaded entries for powershell.exe include several .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard for .NET applications, so that might be normal. But then there's a File created event for a temporary PowerShell script in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating a temporary script isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like executing malicious code, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of Registry value set events from cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. However, without seeing the specific keys or values modified, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. \n\nThe whoami.exe process is used to display user information, which is a legitimate command, but if it's being called in an unusual context, it might be part of a larger attack. However, in the logs, it's just being created normally.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple PowerShell events, including creating a temporary script, might indicate an attempt to execute scripts that could be malicious. The presence of multiple registry modifications could be part of setting up persistence. Also, the loading of Defender-related DLLs by chrome.exe might be a sign of evasion techniques, where malware tries to interact with security software to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the combination of PowerShell creating a temp script, multiple registry changes, and loading of security-related DLLs by non-system processes could be indicative of malicious activity. However, there's not enough information to be 100% certain. The score here is leaning towards interesting but not conclusive. I'd say it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of normal system behavior and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation:** A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. While temporary script creation is common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., policy testing), it could also be a red flag if the script is later executed or contains malicious content.\n   - **Image Loads:** PowerShell loads standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which are typical for .NET applications. However, the repeated logging of image loads may indicate unusual execution contexts or evasion techniques.\n\n2. **Chrome.exe and Defender DLLs:**\n   - **Amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll:** These are legitimate Windows Defender components. However, their loading by `chrome.exe` (a non-system process) could indicate attempts to interact with or bypass security mechanisms (e.g., anti-virus evasion). This requires deeper inspection of the process context and memory behavior.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequent Registry Changes:** Multiple `Registry value set` events from `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` suggest potential attempts to modify system configurations or establish persistence. Without visibility into the specific keys\/paths modified, this remains ambiguous but raises concerns.\n\n4. **Process Behavior:**\n   - **PowerShell and Cmd.exe:** The high frequency of `Process accessed` and `Registry value set` events from these tools may indicate scripting or automation, which is common in both legitimate and malicious contexts.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Suspicious Patterns:** The combination of temporary script creation, registry modifications, and unusual DLL loading by non-system processes (e.g., Chrome) could signal malicious activity, such as:\n  - **Persistence Mechanisms** (via registry changes).\n  - **Evasion Techniques** (interacting with Defender components).\n  - **Command-and-Control (C2) Communication** (via PowerShell scripts).\n- **Legitimate Alternatives:** Some behavior (e.g., PowerShell script execution, registry changes during setup) is normal in administrative workflows. However, the lack of clear context (e.g., user interaction, known tools) increases uncertainty.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Additional Data:** Check for:\n  - **Process Tree Analysis:** Are these processes spawned by legitimate parents (e.g., user-initiated tasks)?\n  - **Network Activity:** Are there unusual outbound connections from PowerShell or Chrome?\n  - **Memory Forensics:** Inspect the Chrome and PowerShell processes for signs of code injection or anomalous memory usage.\n- **Script Content Analysis:** Analyze the contents of the created PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`) for malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n- **User Context:** Verify if the user (`fiddelis`) has legitimate reasons to execute these actions (e.g., software development, testing).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **moderately suspicious** and merit further investigation. While some activities are consistent with legitimate system operations, the combination of registry modifications, PowerShell script creation, and unusual DLL loading by non-system processes raises concerns about potential malicious intent. A deeper forensic analysis is required to confirm or rule out adversarial activity. \n\n**Score:** 🟡 **Suspicious (Investigate Further)**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is a File Delete logged by FileDeleteDetected rule, involving a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because deleting a script might be part of cleanup after an attack.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, all with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}'. These might be normal, but the repetition could indicate something automated or malicious.\n\nNext, there's a File created event for a .yml.new file from Winlogbeat. That might be part of a legitimate setup, but not sure yet.\n\nThen, a Pipe Created event and some Image loaded events, including a Defender DLL. The ImageLoad event is about a legitimate Defender file, so probably benign.\n\nFile created in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive could be normal PowerShell behavior. Registry value sets and Process accesses are common but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign but could be used for privilege checking.\n\nThe next set of PowerShell commands are testing if certain .bat files exist. The paths have patterns like ..\\ which might be trying to access parent directories. However, the commands just exit based on existence, not performing any harmful actions. But the repetition of these checks across different paths might be part of a script trying to locate files in specific directories, which could be part of a larger attack plan.\n\nHowever, none of the events show actual malicious activity like data exfiltration, execution of payloads, or persistence mechanisms. The majority are either normal operations or benign checks. The only potentially suspicious part is the File Delete in Temp and the repeated path checks, but without more context, it's hard to confirm. So, the batch is somewhat interesting but not strongly indicative of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing path-checking commands with obfuscated paths containing '..\\\\' segments, potentially probing for sensitive files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several process create and access events, image loads, and file operations. The first event shows a PowerShell script checking if a certain file exists, then exiting 0 or 1. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script's validation.\n\nThen there are multiple image loads of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's typical for PowerShell when it's running scripts, especially if it's using .NET assemblies. But there's also a load of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal if the system is scanning, but maybe worth noting.\n\nFile creation and deletion in the Temp directory are common, but the fact that a temporary script is created and then deleted could be part of normal operations. However, the presence of multiple such files might indicate something else. Also, there's a file created in the Downloads folder, which might be benign, but not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events from Chrome.exe. That's a lot of registry changes. Chrome might be updating its settings, but multiple registry modifications in a short time could be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or configuration changes. However, Chrome does interact with the registry, so maybe it's just normal behavior. But the number of events here is high, which could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell command lines, they are all checking if certain batch files exist. The paths have patterns like ..\\componente_temporario, which might be indicating some directory traversal. But again, that could be part of a legitimate script's logic. However, if these paths are pointing to unexpected locations or if the scripts are being executed in a way that's not standard, that's a concern.\n\nThe presence of multiple ImageLoad events for Defender DLLs might indicate that the system is actively scanning, but combined with the registry changes and the PowerShell activity, it's a bit suspicious. However, the main issue here is the combination of events. The Chrome.exe registry changes are numerous and might be an indicator of something trying to modify the registry extensively, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nOn the other hand, the PowerShell activities don't show any obvious malicious commands. They're just checking file paths and exiting. The file operations are temporary. However, the high number of registry changes by Chrome might be a red flag. It's possible that this is a false positive, but the combination of events does warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the batch does have some suspicious elements, especially the numerous registry changes by Chrome and the PowerShell script checks. But without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, enough indicators are present to suggest that this might be worth looking into further. Therefore, the answer should be that this is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs presents a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple instances of PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of `.bat` files in paths with patterns like `..\\\\componente_temporario` (directory traversal). While this could be part of a legitimate script's logic, the repetitive nature and lack of clear purpose raise questions.\n   - Temporary script files are created and deleted in the `Temp` directory, which is common but could be used to execute transient malicious code.\n\n2. **Image Loads:**\n   - PowerShell loads .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which is normal for script execution. However, the loading of **Windows Defender DLLs** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) might indicate system scanning or anti-malware activity, but could also be a sign of evasion tactics.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **10+ registry value set events** from `chrome.exe` are highly unusual. Chrome typically does not modify the registry extensively, and such a high volume of changes could indicate:\n     - **Malware attempting to persist** by altering registry keys.\n     - A **browser hijacker** or **adware** modifying Chrome's settings.\n     - A **false positive** (e.g., Chrome updating itself or interacting with third-party extensions).\n\n4. **File Operations:**\n   - Creation of a file in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` could relate to PowerShell profile configuration, but its purpose is unclear without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Unusual Registry Activity:** Chrome's extensive registry modifications are a red flag, as this is not typical behavior.\n- **Repetitive PowerShell Checks:** The scripts' pattern of checking for batch files in non-standard paths may indicate attempts to locate or execute payloads.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The logs lack context (e.g., user intent, system state) to confirm whether the activity is benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch **merits further investigation** due to:\n- **High volume of registry changes** by Chrome.exe.\n- **Repetitive PowerShell checks** for batch files in non-standard paths.\n- **Potential evasion tactics** (e.g., loading Defender DLLs).\n\n**Recommendation:** Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree, user behavior) and use threat intelligence to determine if the activity aligns with known malicious patterns. If no benign explanation is found, consider isolating the system for deeper analysis. \n\n**Answer:** Yes, this batch is interesting for investigation due to suspicious registry modifications and repetitive PowerShell activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious patterns or activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers to execute malicious scripts. So that's a red flag right there. Let me check the details.\n\nLooking at the third event, there's a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content. The command creates a batch file and writes \"dir\" into another. That seems odd because \"dir\" is a basic command, but the paths are a bit suspicious. The paths have multiple dots and double backslashes, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path or to navigate directories in a way that's not straightforward. For example, \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\componente_temporario_script.bat\" – the \"..\" suggests moving up a directory, which could be a way to hide the real location or to bypass certain security checks.\n\nThen there are several events where ImageLoad is triggered, loading various DLLs related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might indicate that the process is loading unexpected or malicious DLLs. However, the paths listed here are standard system paths, so that might not be a direct sign of malware. Still, the combination with PowerShell activities could be concerning.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated use of the Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks. These might be part of normal operations, but when paired with the PowerShell scripts creating and modifying files, it could be part of a larger attack. The scripts are creating batch files in temporary directories and writing simple commands into them. This might be a setup for further malicious activities, like executing more complex scripts or downloading payloads.\n\nAlso, the FileCreated event points to a temporary file in the user's AppData directory. Temporary files can be normal, but if they're being created by a script that's obfuscated or has unusual paths, it could be a sign of something malicious. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a misleading name to appear legitimate, but the presence of such a file in the Temp directory could be part of a script execution that's bypassing security policies.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell executions with obfuscated paths, creation of temporary files, and loading of system DLLs. While some of these activities are normal, the combination and the obfuscation techniques used in the paths and filenames might indicate an attempt to evade detection. The scripts themselves are simple now, but they could be a prelude to more complex actions. This pattern is often seen in attacks where attackers first establish a foothold using PowerShell, then proceed to deploy more malicious payloads.\n\nTherefore, these events are likely worth investigating further. The security team should check the contents of the created files, monitor for any unusual network activity from the affected user, and ensure that PowerShell usage is properly constrained with policies to prevent such scripts from executing without proper authorization.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs indicate **potentially suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Scripting with Obfuscated Paths**\n- **Multiple entries** involve `powershell.exe` executing commands that **create and modify files** using obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\...`).  \n  - **`..` in paths** suggests directory traversal, which may be used to **obfuscate the true location** of files or bypass security checks.  \n  - **Example command**:  \n    ```powershell\n    New-Item \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\componente_temporario_script.bat\" -Force\n    Set-Content -Path \"C:\\\\pacote_base\\\\...\" -Value \"dir\"\n    ```  \n    While `dir` is a benign command, the **repeated creation of batch files** in non-standard locations raises concerns about **script-based lateral movement or persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. File Creation in Temporary Directories**\n- A file is created in the user's temporary directory:  \n  ```plaintext\n  C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1\n  ```  \n  - The filename includes `__PSScriptPolicyTest`, which may be an **attempt to mimic legitimate PowerShell testing** (e.g., policy validation).  \n  - **Temporary directories** are common in attacks for **staging malicious payloads** or evading detection.\n\n---\n\n### **3. ImageLoad Events for System DLLs**\n- Multiple `ImageLoad` events reference **legitimate system DLLs** (e.g., `.NET Framework`, `Windows Defender` components).  \n  - While these are **not inherently malicious**, their **repeated loading** in conjunction with PowerShell activity could indicate **DLL hijacking** or **injection** if the process context is anomalous.  \n  - Further investigation is needed to confirm whether these DLLs are being loaded by **unexpected processes** or in **unusual contexts**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events**\n- **`Provider Lifecycle`** and **`Engine Lifecycle`** events are associated with PowerShell commands.  \n  - These events are **normal in PowerShell** but may be exploited in attacks to **bypass execution policies** or **mask malicious activity** (e.g., using `Invoke-Expression` or `IEX`).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicious Behavior**\n| Indicator | Concern |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Obfuscated file paths** | May be used to evade detection or bypass security controls. |\n| **Creation of temporary files** | Common in attacks for payload staging or persistence. |\n| **Repeated PowerShell activity** | Could indicate **script-based attacks** (e.g., credential dumping, lateral movement). |\n| **Unusual process context** | If `ImageLoad` or `Provider Lifecycle` events occur in **unexpected processes**, this could signal **malware execution**. |\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Inspect the contents** of the created files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) for obfuscation, encoded payloads, or command-line arguments.  \n2. **Check user permissions** and **PowerShell execution policies** for the affected user (`fiddelis`).  \n3. **Monitor network activity** from the user’s session for **unusual outbound connections** or data exfiltration.  \n4. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., Windows Event Logs, SIEM alerts) to identify **anomalies in process behavior** or **privilege escalation**.  \n5. **Implement stricter PowerShell policies** (e.g., `Restricted` or `AllSigned`) to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not confirm a breach, the combination of **obfuscated paths**, **temporary file creation**, and **PowerShell activity** is **highly suspicious** and consistent with **initial access or lateral movement** in an attack chain. Immediate investigation is recommended."}

That could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use temporary files to execute malicious code. However, the file is deleted afterward, which might be an attempt to cover tracks. But without seeing the content of the file, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence, but again, it depends on what's being changed. The events don't specify the keys or values, so that's a bit unclear.\n\nOther events include Process Access and Pipe Created, which are common in legitimate processes but can also be used maliciously. The presence of whoami.exe and cmd.exe might be part of normal user activities, but combined with the PowerShell scripts, it's worth checking.\n\nHowever, looking at all the events, they seem to be a mix of normal system operations and some scripting. The PowerShell commands are checking for files, which could be part of a larger script or a test. The fact that multiple files are created and deleted in Temp might be part of a legitimate process, like a script that generates temporary files. The Image Loads are standard for PowerShell running scripts.\n\nBut wait, the first PowerShell command checks for a file in \"C:\\\\registro_ativo\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_comum.exe\" and exits based on that. Then later, similar paths are checked again. These paths have non-English terms, which could be a red flag. Maybe the user is in a Portuguese-speaking region, but the use of such paths might be part of a test or a legitimate application.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to check for files and the creation\/deletion of temporary files might indicate an attempt to execute a script that's looking for specific executables. If those files are not present, the script exits, which could be part of a conditional execution. However, without seeing the actual payload or more malicious activities, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlso, the presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be part of legitimate security checks, but if the script is trying to bypass Defender, that would be a concern. However, the events don't show any interaction with Defender's processes or any attempts to disable it.\n\nOverall, while there are some suspicious elements like temporary file creation and deletion, and non-standard paths, the events alone don't provide enough evidence of malicious activity. They could be part of a legitimate script or application. However, the frequency of PowerShell usage and the registry changes might warrant further investigation to ensure there's no hidden persistence or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior**, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Activity**:\n   - Multiple `PowerShell.exe` processes execute commands that check for the existence of files (e.g., `IF EXIST` logic) and exit with status codes (`0` or `1`). These are common in scripts but could also be part of **conditional execution** or **pre-checks** for payloads.\n   - Paths referenced (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`) contain **non-English terms** (possibly Portuguese), which may indicate **custom scripts** or **localized applications**, but could also be a red flag for obfuscation.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n   - Temporary files (e.g., `objeto_logico.txt`, `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) are created and deleted. While common in legitimate processes, this pattern is also used by **malware** to avoid leaving traces.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events are logged without details on the keys or values. This could indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries) or **legitimate configuration changes**.\n\n4. **DLL Loading**:\n   - PowerShell loads DLLs from **Windows Defender** (`MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and **.NET Framework**. While normal for PowerShell, the presence of Defender DLLs might suggest **security tool interaction** or **bypass attempts** (if combined with evasion techniques).\n\n5. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`**:\n   - These are standard utilities but may be used in conjunction with PowerShell for **privilege escalation** or **command chaining**.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators (Potential Red Flags):**\n- **Unusual File Paths**: Non-English directories and filenames may indicate **obfuscation** or **custom malware**.\n- **Frequent PowerShell Usage**: Excessive scripting could signal **malicious automation** (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration).\n- **File Creation\/Deletion**: Temporary files are often used by malware to execute payloads or store data.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Explanations:**\n- **Scripting\/Test Activities**: The `IF EXIST` logic and file checks could be part of **legitimate scripts** (e.g., deployment, testing).\n- **Windows Defender Integration**: Loading Defender DLLs might be part of **security checks** or **antivirus interactions**.\n- **User Customization**: Registry changes and non-English paths might reflect **user-specific configurations** or **localized software**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation:**\n1. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Inspect the deleted temporary files (if recoverable) for malicious code or obfuscation.\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check **network traffic**, **process tree**, and **registry key details** to identify persistence or exfiltration.\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **endpoint detection** to track script behavior.\n4. **Check for Malware Signatures**:\n   - Scan the system for known malware using **antivirus tools** or **YARA rules**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **do not definitively indicate malware**, but the combination of **PowerShell scripting**, **temporary file manipulation**, and **unusual paths** raises **low-to-moderate suspicion**. Further analysis is required to determine if this is **legitimate activity** or part of a **malicious campaign**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about processes being accessed, specifically powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and whoami.exe. There are multiple instances of 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events for PowerShell. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. But I need to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the 'command_line' fields in some of the processes. For example, there's a PowerShell command that checks if a specific file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's checking for the presence of a file, which could be benign, but when combined with other events, it might be more suspicious. However, on its own, that's not necessarily bad.\n\nWait, there are several entries where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle'. I'm not too familiar with that specific task, but maybe it's related to some provider or service interaction. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the main thing here is the repeated use of PowerShell and the access to various files.\n\nAnother thing to note is the 'Image loaded' events. They mention loading DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, which is normal for PowerShell to use. However, if there's an unusual pattern here, like loading unexpected DLLs or from unusual paths, that could be a problem. In this case, the paths seem to be standard Windows directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nBut then there's the 'Registry value set' event for PowerShell. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence or configuration changes. However, again, without knowing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. The event just mentions the task, not the actual registry key.\n\nThe repetition of 'Process accessed' for PowerShell multiple times could indicate that the process is being monitored or accessed frequently, which might be normal in some contexts, but if it's part of a larger attack, like trying to execute commands or access files, that's a concern.\n\nLooking at the file paths in the command lines, they all seem to be custom directories like 'C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\entrada_temporario...' etc. These aren't standard system paths, which might be a sign that the attacker is using custom directories to hide files or scripts. However, the commands themselves are simple existence checks. Maybe they're part of a larger script that's not fully visible here.\n\nAnother point is the number of events. There are a lot of PowerShell-related events, which could be normal in a busy environment, but if this is a small system or if there's no prior context, it might be unusual. However, the presence of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be a red flag if they're not expected.\n\nPutting it all together: the logs show multiple PowerShell processes being accessed and created, some checking for the existence of files in non-standard directories, loading .NET DLLs, and registry modifications. While some of these activities are normal for PowerShell, the combination and the frequency might indicate potential malicious activity, especially if the system isn't expected to have such high PowerShell usage. However, without more context or additional suspicious activities (like network connections, unusual user behavior, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. But given that the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the answer would lean towards yes, because the patterns observed are commonly associated with malicious activities and warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits patterns that are **suspicious and warrant further investigation**, though not definitively malicious. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Over 20 entries** involve `powershell.exe`, with tasks like `Process accessed`, `Process Create`, and `Provider Lifecycle`. \n   - PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, but **repeated use in a short timeframe** (especially with unclear purposes) raises concerns.\n\n2. **File Existence Checks in Non-Standard Paths**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for files in **custom, non-system directories** (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\...`).\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     & {if (Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\estrutura_base\\src\\unidade_secundario.cs\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\n     ```\n   - These checks could be part of **script obfuscation, conditional execution, or file-based persistence**. The lack of context (e.g., no clear purpose for these checks) is concerning.\n\n3. **Unusual Task Types**:\n   - **`Provider Lifecycle`** events are rare and not typically associated with standard system behavior. This could indicate **interaction with a custom or third-party provider**, which might be unrelated to the system's normal operations.\n\n4. **DLL Loading**:\n   - **`.NET framework DLLs`** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are loaded, which is expected for PowerShell. However, the **absence of other suspicious DLLs** (e.g., from unknown sources) means this alone is not conclusive.\n\n5. **Registry Modification**:\n   - A single `Registry value set` event for PowerShell is logged, which could indicate **malware persistence or configuration changes**. However, the lack of details (e.g., which registry key was modified) limits immediate judgment.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- **Behavioral Anomalies**: The combination of **repeated PowerShell activity**, **non-standard file paths**, and **unusual task types** deviates from typical system behavior.\n- **Potential for Malicious Use**: The file existence checks could be part of **script-based attacks** (e.g., checking for the presence of a payload file before execution).\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional data (e.g., user context, network activity, or other logs), the logs are **ambiguous but suspicious**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for associated **network activity**, **user behavior**, or **registry changes** to confirm if this is part of a larger attack.\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: Investigate the actual content of the PowerShell commands (e.g., via **script block logging** or **process memory analysis**) to determine if they are benign or malicious.\n3. **Check File Paths**: Verify if the files referenced in `Test-Path` (e.g., `.cs` files) are legitimate or part of a **malicious payload**.\n4. **Monitor Provider Lifecycle Events**: Investigate the source of the `Provider Lifecycle` task, as it may indicate **unauthorized software or services**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile not definitively malicious, the logs show **behavior that is inconsistent with normal system operations** and aligns with patterns seen in **malicious activity**. This warrants **closer scrutiny** and further investigation to rule out threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions an image loaded from the Windows Defender directory, which seems normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then that same file is deleted. Hmm, creating and deleting a script might be part of normal operations, but maybe not always.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which isn't inherently malicious, but it's something to note. Then several events with \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be part of PowerShell's normal operation when running scripts, but I need to check if there's any suspicious command lines.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all seem to be checking if certain files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. For example, Test-Path checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. Wait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which could be malicious. But in these logs, the scripts are just being checked for existence, not executed. However, the fact that multiple paths are being checked for this script might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate it on the system.\n\nAlso, there are several events where PowerShell is accessing processes or registry values. The registry changes could be significant if they're modifying settings that allow persistence or disable security features. But in these logs, the registry event is just a value being set, and the process access events don't specify what's being accessed. \n\nThe repeated checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories might be a red flag. Even though the scripts aren't being executed here, the presence of such a script could be part of a larger attack. However, in the given logs, the only actions are checking if the files exist, which might be part of a reconnaissance phase. \n\nAnother point is the use of the Temp directory for creating scripts. That's common in malicious activities because it's a temporary storage area. The deletion of the script after creation could be an attempt to avoid leaving evidence. \n\nBut I should also consider that some of these might be part of legitimate software or testing. However, the combination of multiple checks for a keystroke-logging script, along with process and registry access, does raise suspicion. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the events show PowerShell checking for specific scripts that could be malicious, creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, and interacting with the registry and processes. These activities, while not definitively malicious on their own, are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repetitive Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across various directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`, `C:\\objeto_temporario\\...`). \n   - While the script itself is not executed in these logs, the **repeated probing** for this file (commonly associated with keyloggers) suggests **reconnaissance** or **searching for existing malicious payloads** on the system.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`<TempFilePath>.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is often used to **avoid leaving evidence** of temporary malicious scripts.\n\n3. **Process and Registry Interactions:**\n   - Events involving **registry value modifications** and **process access** (e.g., `Process accessed`, `Registry value set`) could indicate attempts to **persist** or **modify system behavior**, though the specific changes are not detailed here.\n\n4. **Unusual PowerShell Usage:**\n   - The use of `Test-Path` in multiple command lines (e.g., `if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\")`) suggests **script-based exploration** of the file system, which could be part of **malware deployment** or **lateral movement**.\n\n### **Contextual Considerations:**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases:** Some PowerShell activity (e.g., checking file paths, registry edits) is normal in enterprise environments. However, the **repetition** and **specificity** of the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` checks are highly unusual.\n- **Lack of Execution Evidence:** The logs do not show the execution of the suspicious script, but the **presence of the script** in the Temp directory and the **reconnaissance behavior** still raise concerns.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of:\n- **Repetitive probing for a potentially malicious script** (`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`).\n- **File creation\/deletion in the Temp directory**, a common tactic in stealthy attacks.\n- **Unusual PowerShell activity** that may indicate reconnaissance or preparation for further exploitation.\n\n**Recommendation:** Investigate the system for the presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in the paths mentioned, review registry changes, and analyze PowerShell logs for additional context."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the specific tasks. There are several ImageLoad events for files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting a file might be part of a script execution, but not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that it's in the Temp folder and then deleted could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are PowerShell commands checking if certain paths exist. The paths mentioned are like \"C:\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico...\", which don't look standard. Maybe the attacker is checking for specific files or directories. Also, the presence of \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" in the path names is suspicious. Keystroke logging is a common malicious activity, so that's a big red flag. Even though the scripts aren't executed here, just the presence of such filenames in the paths could indicate an attempt to access or execute malicious scripts.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which might be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Other events involve legitimate processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe, which don't seem suspicious here. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file, which might be part of a log collection tool, but the path is in the Downloads directory, which could be normal.\n\nHowever, the combination of PowerShell checking for keystroke-related scripts, creating a temporary file, and the presence of those specific filenames in the command lines points towards potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a list of JSON objects, each representing a system event. The main task is to look for any signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of Elastic's Winlogbeat, which is used for log collection. Creating a .yml.new file might be part of a configuration update. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The command line for one of them is \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\", which are just directory listing commands. Not inherently malicious, but could be part of a larger script.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe execution, which is a standard tool to check the current user. That's normal, so not a red flag.\n\nMultiple network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making network connections is normal, especially if it's browsing. Svchost.exe is a generic host process for Windows services, so its network activity could be legitimate, but sometimes used by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe interesting part is the ImageLoad events for powershell.exe. The loaded DLLs include mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. These are legitimate components, but there's also a reference to MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. However, the path for MpOAV.dll is in the ProgramData Defender directory, which is a known legitimate location. Wait, but the user mentioned that this is part of the events. However, sometimes malware might inject into legitimate processes, but the presence of these DLLs alone isn't suspicious.\n\nWait, but the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes is using & {ls -recurse ...} which is just a series of directory listings. That's normal. However, the repeated access to processes and registry changes might be worth looking into. The Registry value set events from powershell.exe could be a sign of configuration changes, but again, without knowing what's being changed, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe. PowerShell is a host, but the DLLs loaded are part of the .NET runtime, which is expected when running scripts. However, if there were unexpected DLLs, that would be a red flag. Here, the DLLs are all legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: There's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events include normal system processes, legitimate file creation, and standard network activity. The PowerShell commands don't seem to be doing anything suspicious. The only thing that stands out is the file creation by winlogbeat, but that's part of its normal operation. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation. However, if there were unexpected commands or unusual DLLs, that would be different. But as it stands, it's probably benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event log does not contain clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a `.yml.new` file in the Downloads directory is consistent with its role as a log collector. This is a normal operation during configuration updates.\n   - **`chrome.exe`** and **`svchost.exe`** making network connections aligns with typical user behavior (e.g., browsing) and system service operations.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple **`powershell.exe`** events involve standard commands like `ls -recurse` and `get-childitem -recurse`, which are benign directory listing operations.\n   - **ImageLoad** events reference legitimate .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscoree.dll`) and Windows Defender components (`MpOAV.dll`). These are expected when running PowerShell scripts or interacting with system services.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - **Registry modifications** by `powershell.exe` are not inherently suspicious without context (e.g., changes to sensitive keys or unexpected values).\n   - Repeated **process access** events (e.g., `ImageLoad`, `Process Creation`) are consistent with PowerShell executing scripts or loading dependencies.\n\n### **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- No unusual file paths, unexpected network destinations, or suspicious command-line arguments.\n- All loaded DLLs and processes are associated with legitimate software (e.g., .NET, Windows Defender).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events appear to reflect normal system operations and user activity. There is **no strong evidence of malicious behavior** in this log. Further investigation would require additional context (e.g., correlation with other logs, unusual user behavior, or anomalies in network traffic). \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not Interesting for Investigation** (Benign activity)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a file created by PowerShell in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. Then, the same file is deleted. That's a bit suspicious because creating and deleting a script might be part of an attack. Next, there's a pipe created, but no file involved. Then, multiple entries with the same command line using 'ls -recurse' and similar commands. That seems like someone is listing files recursively, maybe looking for something.
