{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious here. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe events. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the powershell.exe entries has a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL using WebClient. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting text files like LICENSE.txt. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files multiple times might be a red flag. Especially if it's downloading to the TEMP directory, which is often used by malware to store temporary files.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. But there's also a file from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's just part of normal operations. However, the repeated loading of these DLLs might be normal, but combined with the download activities, it could indicate something.\n\nThen there are FileCreate and FileDelete events for temporary files. The file is created and then immediately deleted. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, but it can also be a tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. However, the fact that the file is a .ps1 script (PowerShell script) might be more concerning. The names of the files are like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1, which looks like a temporary script file. But the command lines show that PowerShell is downloading LICENSE.txt files, which are typically benign. However, the repetition and the number of such events might be suspicious.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the command_line in some entries includes DownloadFile from GitHub. If those are just downloading LICENSE.txt files, that's normal. But the fact that there are multiple instances of this, and the files are being created and deleted, could indicate that someone is testing or trying to execute scripts. Also, the presence of the Registry value set events might be related to changing settings, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any unusual behavior. The Chrome events are normal. The PowerShell events include downloading files from GitHub, which is common, but the fact that there are so many of them, and the use of temporary files, might be part of a larger pattern. However, the justification for being interesting would be if there's a potential for malicious activity. Since the files downloaded are LICENSE.txt, which are usually not malicious, but the repeated actions and the use of PowerShell for downloading could be part of a script that's being tested or used for something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is just using PowerShell for legitimate tasks, but the frequency is high. However, the combination of multiple downloads, temporary file creation, and registry changes could indicate a script that's being run multiple times, possibly as part of an attack or testing. But without more context, like the content of the downloaded files or the actual execution of the scripts, it's hard to say for sure. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell downloads and the use of temporary files might be enough to flag this as potentially interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, even though some activities appear benign at first glance. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Concerns:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Download Activity:**\n   - **Multiple instances** of `powershell.exe` executing `WebClient.DownloadFile` to download `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`). While downloading text files from GitHub is common, the **frequency and repetition** (15+ instances) suggest potential misuse, such as:\n     - **Automated testing** of scripts or payloads.\n     - **Malicious script execution** disguised as benign downloads (e.g., downloading and executing malicious content under the guise of \"LICENSE.txt\").\n     - **Command-and-control (C2) communication** via GitHub (unusual for legitimate use).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A PowerShell script creates a temporary `.ps1` file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1`) in the `%TEMP%` directory and immediately deletes it. This pattern is often seen in:\n     - **Malware obfuscation** (avoiding detection by minimizing disk footprint).\n     - **Post-exploitation activities** (e.g., executing scripts in memory or via temporary files).\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - The presence of **`Provider Lifecycle`** events (likely related to PowerShell's registry interactions) and **`Registry value set`** events could indicate:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying registry keys to ensure reexecution of malicious scripts).\n     - **Bypassing execution policies** (e.g., altering PowerShell settings to allow unsigned scripts).\n\n4. **Image Load Events:**\n   - While some loaded DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are legitimate .NET components, the **repeated loading** of `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender's antimalware platform) might indicate:\n     - **Evasion techniques** (e.g., triggering Defender's scanning behavior to mask malicious activity).\n     - **Tampering with legitimate processes** (e.g., hijacking Defender's DLLs).\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- **Anomalous Behavior:** The combination of repetitive PowerShell downloads, temporary file manipulation, and registry changes is **unusual for benign activities** (e.g., software updates or testing).\n- **Potential for Malicious Use:** The use of GitHub as a source for `LICENSE.txt` files could be a **tactic to exfiltrate data** or **download payloads** disguised as harmless text files.\n- **Lack of Context:** The absence of clear indicators of compromise (e.g., failed login attempts, network exfiltration) makes it **ambiguous**, but the **volume and patterns** of events justify deeper analysis.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree, file hashes) to confirm if the downloaded files are malicious.\n- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:** Investigate the content of the temporary `.ps1` files (if recovered) to determine if they contain malicious code.\n- **Monitor GitHub Activity:** Verify if the repositories involved are legitimate or if they have been compromised.\n- **Check Execution Policies:** Ensure PowerShell execution policies (e.g., `Restricted`, `AllSigned`) are configured securely to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities (e.g., Chrome DNS queries, .NET DLL loads) are normal, the **repetitive PowerShell downloads, temporary file manipulation, and registry changes** suggest **potential malicious intent** or **unusual behavior** that requires further investigation. This batch of events is **interesting for investigation**. \n\n**Score:** ⚠️ **High Suspicion** (4\/5) – Requires deeper analysis to confirm benignity or malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. The command lines in some entries involve downloading files from GitHub using WebClient's DownloadFile method. URLs like https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...\/LICENSE.txt are mentioned. Wait, LICENSE.txt is a common file in repositories, but the fact that it's being downloaded to temporary directories like $env:TEMP might be a red flag. Sometimes attackers use similar techniques to download malicious payloads, even if the file name is benign.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. However, repeated registry changes could indicate some form of modification or persistence mechanism, though without more context, it's hard to tell. But the number of chrome.exe events here is quite high (eight entries), which might be normal if the user is interacting with Chrome, but maybe not if it's automated.\n\nAnother point is the file creation events. There's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt and others. However, the most suspicious part is the PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub. Even though the files are named LICENSE.txt, which are typically harmless, the method of using PowerShell to download them could be part of a larger malicious activity. Attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for downloading and executing payloads.\n\nAlso, there's a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is a log shipper. That might be part of normal operations, but if it's creating configuration files (.yml.new), that could be part of setup or configuration changes. However, without seeing the content of those files, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing is the Dns query event, but the process is listed as None, which might be an error or a system-level query. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the multiple PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub. Even though the files are named LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign, the fact that they're being downloaded using PowerShell and saved to temporary directories could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code. The repetition of similar commands with different URLs might suggest a pattern. However, since the files are named after licenses, it's possible they are legitimate. But the combination of multiple downloads and the use of PowerShell in this way raises some flags. The other events like registry changes and file creations don't seem as suspicious on their own. \n\nSo, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation because the PowerShell activities could be indicative of malicious behavior, even if the files themselves are not obviously malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executed commands to download files from GitHub repositories (e.g., 'raw.githubusercontent.com') using WebClient's DownloadFile method. While the files are named 'LICENSE.txt' (common in repositories), the use of PowerShell for such downloads combined with temporary directory storage raises suspicion of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION_DETAIL\": \"The repetition of similar download patterns with different repository paths, along with the lack of clear benign context for these downloads, indicates a need for further investigation into whether these files represent legitimate operations or part of a larger attack chain.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' both loading 'urlmon.dll'. Wait, 'calc.exe' is a legitimate Windows process, but 'Calculator.exe' with a capital 'C' might be a typo or a different executable. However, both are loading a legitimate DLL from System32. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for 'svchost.exe' and 'powershell.exe' with registry events. 'svchost.exe' is normal, but if there are a lot of registry changes, that could be a red flag. However, the logs show 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' events. But without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines. There's a 'cmd.exe' running 'SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F', which is deleting a scheduled task named 'spawn'. Another 'cmd.exe' is running 'REG DELETE' to remove a registry key. Then there's a 'reg.exe' deleting another registry key. These actions might be part of cleaning up after some activity, which is common in malware to avoid detection. But is that enough?\n\nAlso, 'whoami.exe' is being executed multiple times. That's a normal utility, but repeated use might indicate someone checking privileges or user context. However, it's not inherently malicious.\n\nThe 'schtasks.exe' process is involved in deleting a task, which could be part of a larger attack. But again, without seeing the creation of the task, it's hard to say. The 'conhost.exe' entries are related to registry changes, but that's part of the Windows console host, so maybe normal.\n\nWait, there's a 'cmd.exe' with a command line that includes 'REG DELETE' for 'HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run' with a value name 'modulo_temporario' and another 'pacote_auxiliar'. These might be temporary names, but deleting from the Run key could be part of removing persistence mechanisms. If an attacker was using the Run key to start a malicious process and then deletes it, that's a sign of cleanup.\n\nAlso, the fact that 'powershell.exe' is involved in multiple 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, but it's also a legitimate tool. The combination of registry deletions and process accesses might indicate someone trying to remove traces of their activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry deletions in the Run key, deletion of scheduled tasks, and repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for these actions. This could be part of an attack where the attacker is trying to remove persistence mechanisms, which is a common post-exploitation activity. However, the logs don't show the initial exploitation or the creation of the malicious tasks or registry entries, only the deletion. So it's a bit ambiguous. But the fact that they're deleting these entries might be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger pattern not visible here.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these actions could be part of a legitimate system maintenance or user activity. Without more context, like other events or network activity, it's challenging. But given the information here, the suspicious actions are the registry deletions and the use of commands to remove potential persistence points. So I think this is worth investigating further, hence the 'interesting' label.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, indicating potential post-exploitation behavior or cleanup efforts by an attacker. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities:**\n1. **Registry Key Deletions:**\n   - Multiple `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` processes are deleting entries in the **`HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`** registry key (e.g., `\"modulo_temporario\"` and `\"pacote_auxiliar\"`). This is a common tactic to remove **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., malicious startup entries) after initial compromise, suggesting an attempt to erase traces of unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Deletion:**\n   - A `cmd.exe` process runs `SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F`, indicating the deletion of a scheduled task named **`spawn`**. This could be part of removing **scheduled persistence** (e.g., a backdoor or malicious payload) after exploitation.\n\n3. **Frequent Use of PowerShell and CMD:**\n   - Repeated `Process accessed` events for `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` (e.g., executing `REG DELETE`, `SCHTASKS`, and `whoami`) suggest **manual command-line operations**, which are often used by attackers for system manipulation or data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Legitimate Processes with Unusual Context:**\n   - While processes like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are legitimate, their **frequency and context** (e.g., registry deletions, task removal) raise concerns. For example, `whoami.exe` being executed multiple times may indicate **privilege checks** or **user context enumeration**.\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Registry Key Deletion:** `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` (values: `modulo_temporario`, `pacote_auxiliar`).\n- **Scheduled Task Deletion:** Task name `spawn`.\n- **Unusual Command-Line Activity:** Use of `REG DELETE`, `SCHTASKS \/Delete`, and repeated `whoami` executions.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **post-exploitation behavior** (e.g., cleanup of persistence mechanisms) rather than direct exploitation. While some activity could be legitimate (e.g., system maintenance), the **pattern of registry and task deletions** combined with **frequent use of command-line tools** suggests **potential malicious intent**. Further investigation is required, including:\n- Correlating these events with **creation** of the deleted tasks\/registry entries (if available).\n- Checking for **network activity** or **file modifications** around the same timeframe.\n- Analyzing **user context** (e.g., admin privileges) during these operations.\n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation**—the activities are suspicious and may indicate an attacker attempting to remove evidence of compromise."}

First, I'll go through each entry and note the key details.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries with \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" tasks. Also, there are multiple instances of \"Image loaded\" with paths to various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender.

Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's 'whoami.exe' being run, which is a normal command to check the current user. Then 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' are being accessed and creating processes. The registry events might be normal too, but I need to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking further, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' processes. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. But I need to see if there's anything unusual. The command line for one of them is 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like a no-op, maybe just testing or a benign script. However, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be part of normal operations, but the frequency could be a concern.\n\nThen, there are image load events for some .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll.

PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but when combined with certain events, it can be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, chrome.exe has multiple registry value sets. That's a lot. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much. Maybe something's wrong here. Then there are entries with command_line for powershell.exe, but they seem empty or just placeholders like & {}. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so probably legitimate. But then a file created in the user's AppData folder. That's common for PowerShell scripts, but not necessarily bad.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user context. But then another powershell.exe trying to remove a file named objeto_principal.zip from the temp directory. The command line shows \"Remove-Item\" with ErrorAction Ignore.

That's common, but sometimes it can be a red flag if there's suspicious behavior. Let me check the specific events.\n\nThe first event is about 'Image loaded' for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal. Then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be part of a script's normal operation, but maybe not. Then there are several 'Pipe Created' and 'Provider Lifecycle' events, which might be part of legitimate processes but could also be used in attacks.\n\nWait, there are multiple instances of 'Remove-Item' commands in the command_line fields.

But the repeated PowerShell deletions and the creation of temporary files make me think that there might be a script that's being executed and then cleaned up. The use of '-ErrorAction Ignore' in the Remove-Item commands suggests that the script is trying to avoid errors if the files don't exist, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to prevent detection.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of PowerShell creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, multiple deletions with error suppression, and the potential for persistence through registry changes could indicate a suspicious activity.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first event shows a command line that removes a temporary file named 'unidade_base.txt' with Force and ErrorAction Ignore. That might be suspicious because deleting files, especially with Ignore errors, could be part of a cleanup after malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs isn't necessarily bad, but the combination with other events might be a clue. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender could indicate that the process is interacting with antivirus components, which might be normal or could be a sign of evasion.\n\nThere are also several File Create and File Delete events. For example, a file is created in the Temp directory, then immediately deleted. That could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily. The fact that multiple temporary files are being created and deleted might be a red flag, as attackers often use temporary files to store malicious payloads.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a pattern of using Remove-Item on temporary files.

However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like downloading files, connecting to suspicious IPs, etc.), it's a bit tricky. But the combination of these events might still be considered interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of activities that warrant further investigation, though they do not definitively indicate malicious behavior. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell Activity**: Multiple entries involve `powershell.exe` executing commands like `Remove-Item` on temporary files (e.g., `unidade_base.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`). While such commands are common in legitimate scripts, the use of `ErrorAction Ignore` and repeated deletion of temporary files could suggest an attempt to obscure activity or clean up traces.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion**: Several files are created and immediately deleted in temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`). This behavior is often seen in malware to avoid detection but could also be part of benign automation.\n\n3. **DLL Loading**: PowerShell loads DLLs from Windows Defender (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and .NET Framework components. While legitimate, this could indicate evasion techniques (e.g., interacting with antivirus processes) or benign operations depending on context.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access**: Events like `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` suggest system-wide interactions. However, without additional context (e.g., unauthorized registry changes), these are inconclusive.\n\n5. **Legitimate Commands**: The presence of `whoami.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) indicates some normal system operations. However, the coexistence of these with suspicious PowerShell activity raises questions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs show **potentially suspicious behavior** (e.g., repeated file manipulation, PowerShell usage) that could be indicative of an investigation-worthy event. However, the absence of clear malicious indicators (e.g., network connections, unauthorized modifications) means further analysis is required.\n\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING**  \n**Justification**: The combination of PowerShell-driven file operations, temporary file creation\/deletion, and interaction with system components warrants closer examination to rule out malicious activity.  \n**Confidence**: 0.75 (Moderate) – The behavior is suspicious but not conclusive without additional context."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be a JSON with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. Most of them are about 'chrome.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe' with registry value sets. Then there are several entries for 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe'. The 'whoami.exe' ones have command lines showing they're running from the system32 directory. The last two events involve 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file and 'powershell.exe' creating another file named 'pacote_ativo.txt'.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The key here is to see if there's any suspicious activity. The repeated registry changes by chrome and RuntimeBroker might be normal, but not necessarily. However, the 'whoami.exe' executions are common for checking user context, but when they're called from system32, that's normal too. The real red flags are the file creations. The 'pacote_ativo.txt' being created by powershell could be benign, but the path is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user activities. However, the other file created by winlogbeat is in a specific path, which might be part of a legitimate software installation. \n\nWait, but looking at the 'powershell.exe' events, they are all 'Process accessed' which might be normal. However, the repetition of 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times might be a sign of something. But 'whoami' is a standard tool. The main thing is that there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The events are mostly routine system activities. Unless there's something I'm missing, like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected processes. But all the processes mentioned are legitimate. The 'pacote_ativo.txt' might be a file created by the user, but without more context, it's hard to say. The confidence level here is low because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. So, the classification would be 'NOT INTERESTING' with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of benign activities such as Chrome and RuntimeBroker registry modifications, standard PowerShell and whoami process executions, and file creation by legitimate tools (winlogbeat). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
