{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell.exe is being accessed. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's a 'whoami.exe' process created, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. But then there are multiple instances of PowerShell being accessed again. \n\nNext, there's a registry value set event for PowerShell. Still, not too alarming. Then, a cmd.exe process is created with a command line that uses wmic to create a notepad.exe. That seems normal, but sometimes attackers use wmic for malicious purposes. \n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for WMIC.exe loading dlls like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a malicious process is loading this, it might be trying to bypass detection. Also, the paths for the dlls include Windows Defender's directories, which could be a red flag if unexpected.\n\nThen, there's a registry value set by wmiprvse.exe, which is related to Windows Management Instrumentation. That's part of the system, but again, if there's unusual activity here, it might be suspicious. \n\nA notepad.exe is created, which is normal. However, there's a file created by PowerShell at 'objeto_temporario.txt'â€”maybe temporary, but not necessarily bad. The winlogbeat process creating a .yml.new file is part of log shipping, so that's probably legitimate. \n\nHowever, the repeated access to PowerShell, the loading of Defender's dlls by WMIC, and the registry changes might indicate something. Attackers sometimes use PowerShell for persistence or to execute commands. The fact that WMIC is loading amsi.dll could be an attempt to disable or bypass AMSI, which is a common evasion technique. \n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry value set events might indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. The combination of these events, especially the suspicious dll loads and repeated PowerShell activity, raises a red flag. \n\nI should check if there's a pattern here. The events involve process creation, registry modifications, and loading of specific dlls. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination does suggest potential malicious behavior. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with medium to high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell access, WMIC loading of AMSI and Defender DLLs (potential evasion), and registry modifications. These patterns may indicate malicious behavior such as privilege escalation or anti-virus bypass attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
