{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, browsers often do that. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but maybe part of a larger malicious activity. Then powershell.exe and process accessed. PowerShell is common but can be abused.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be normal, but the path is in the Downloads folder, which isn't unusual. Then, multiple entries about certutil.exe. Oh, certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding files, which can be part of malicious activities, like hiding malware. \n\nWait, there's a command line using certutil -encode on calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows app, but encoding it might be a way to obfuscate. Then decoding it into a temp file. That's suspicious. Also, creating files in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. \n\nMultiple registry value set events, which could indicate changes to the system configuration. Also, rundll32.exe running PcaSvc.dll, which might be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes used in exploits. \n\nSDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those are system DLLs, but if loaded from unexpected locations, that could be a sign of something bad. However, the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe legitimate. \n\nChrome.exe has several network connections, which is normal, but the repeated entries might be worth checking. Also, the powershell.exe creating a file named componente_auxiliar.txt. Not sure what that is, but could be benign or malicious. \n\nPutting it all together: The presence of certutil encoding and decoding files, multiple registry changes, and the use of temporary files could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code. However, some events are normal (like chrome's DNS queries and whoami.exe). The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are legitimate, but the combination of certutil usage and registry changes might be suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification is INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including certutil.exe encoding\/decoding files (common in malware), registry modifications, and execution of decoded payloads in temporary directories. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where chrome.exe is performing a \"Registry value set\" task. That's a common activity, maybe part of normal operations. But then I see an entry with SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but sometimes malicious software might use it. However, just loading it might not be suspicious on its own. \n\nNext, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring and shipping logs, so that seems normal. The file path looks like a typical installation directory. But then there are multiple entries from powershell.exe with \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" tasks. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but if there's a lot of activity here, especially if it's modifying the registry or accessing processes, that could be a red flag. \n\nNow, considering all the events together. The majority are from chrome and powershell, which are common applications. However, the repetition of registry modifications by powershell might indicate something. But wait, are there any signs of malicious activity? The SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll might not be harmful, but the combination of multiple registry changes and process accesses by PowerShell could be part of a larger attack. However, without more context like unusual registry keys being modified or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. \n\nThe user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. The presence of multiple registry events from PowerShell, along with the other events, might not be enough to classify as interesting. Unless there's a pattern that's not immediately obvious. But given the information, the events don't show clear signs of a security threat. So maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are within normal operations. However, the repetition might warrant a closer look. But since the justification needs to be concise, I should check if there's enough evidence. Maybe the confidence is moderate, but not high enough for interesting. So the final call is not interesting, as the events don't show clear malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of routine registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell, a legitimate DLL load by SDXHelper.exe, and a file creation by Winlogbeat (a monitoring tool). No clear malicious activity or anomalous patterns are evident across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
