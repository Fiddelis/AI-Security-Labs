Let's look at each event.\n\nAll the events have the same process name: git.exe. The task is a \"File created\" event under the rule FileCreate. Each file path starts with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. Then they each have different .d.ts files like forOwn.d.ts, forOwnRight.d.ts, etc.\n\nSo the same process is creating multiple files in a specific directory. The path seems to be related to node_modules, which suggests it's part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project. Cypress is a testing framework, and lodash is a utility library, so this might be a development environment.\n\nI know that when developers work with version control systems like Git, they often clone repositories or pull updates, which can cause several files to be created or modified. The process name being git.exe indicates it's the Git executable performing these actions.\n\nLooking at each file path, all are within the node_modules folder, which is typical for npm packages. These .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files, which define interfaces and types used in projects. So, when a project is set up or updated, Git might be involved in fetching dependencies, leading to creation of these files.\n\nIs this behavior unusual? Not really. During development, especially with tools like npm and Git, it's common to see multiple file creation events as part of installing packages or updating the project structure. Since all events are consistent and point to legitimate activities related to software development, there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here.\n\nI should consider if this could indicate something suspicious. Maybe a lot of file creations in a short time might suggest a potential issue, but in this case, each event is just creating one file, which aligns with normal operations. There's no evidence of access to sensitive files or unusual paths outside the expected project structure.\n\nSo overall, these events look like they're part of standard development workflows and don't raise any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch consists of multiple events where git.exe creates several .d.ts files in a node_modules directory, which is typical for a development environment setting up TypeScript type definitions.

The file paths point to .d.ts files, which are TypeScript declaration files. These are standard in Node.js projects for type definitions.\n\nSince Git is involved, it's likely that these events are part of a development environment where someone is working on a project using Git. The node_modules directory suggests they're using npm or yarn, common package managers for JavaScript and Node-based applications. Cypress is mentioned, which is an end-to-end testing framework, so this could be a developer setting up their test environment.\n\nThe repeated \"File created\" events over these files might seem suspicious at first glance because multiple file creations in quick succession can sometimes indicate malicious activity like dropping files during an attack. However, in this context, it makes sense that Git is creating or updating these files as part of its normal operations, especially if the developer is cloning a repository or pulling updates.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether these file paths are known to be associated with malware. Lodash is a popular JavaScript library, and its type definitions are standard in projects using TypeScript. The specific files under \"fp\" (which stands for \"functional programming\") don't raise any red flags as they're part of the expected structure.\n\nI also think about whether there's any unusual volume or timing here. If these events occurred over a short period, it might still be normal for Git operations that involve multiple file checks or updates. Since all events are consistent and follow a pattern without variations in process names or file types, it doesn't suggest anything out of the ordinary.\n\nIn cybersecurity, context is key. Without more data indicating unusual behavior (like access from unknown locations, multiple failed attempts, or other anomalies), these logs seem benign. Developers often work with Git and node_modules extensively, so such events are routine.\n\nTherefore, after considering all angles—process name, file types, directory structure, and typical user activity—it's clear that this batch doesn't indicate malicious behavior but is instead part of normal software development processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of TypeScript declaration files by Git during normal development activities, indicating routine file operations rather than malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Looking at the file paths, they're all under \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\". The filenames are various \".d.ts\" files, which I know are TypeScript declaration files.\n\nSo each event is a file creation notification from Git. These are likely part of the development process when someone is working on a project that uses Cypress and Lodash. The repeated file creations suggest that maybe the user is installing or updating dependencies, perhaps after pulling changes from a repository. Alternatively, it could be during the build process where these files are generated or copied.\n\nI also see that all events are from the same source (git.exe) and involve creating files in the same directory structure. This pattern looks normal for a developer environment where tools like npm install or yarn add are being run, causing package managers to download and extract necessary modules, including their TypeScript types.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity here? Not that I can see. There's no evidence of unusual file paths, attempts to access restricted areas, or signs of data exfiltration. The files created are standard TypeScript declarations, which are usually safe and part of the development setup.\n\nIt might be worth considering if these events could indicate a compromise where an attacker is using Git for some malicious purpose, but without additional context like unusual timestamps, geographic locations, or deviations from normal user behavior, it's hard to say. However, given that all activities are within expected patterns for a developer environment and there are no red flags in the file operations themselves, this batch doesn't seem concerning.\n\nI should also think about whether repeated file creations could be part of a larger attack vector, such as a persistence mechanism or lateral movement.

The paths all point to different .d.ts files under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp. These look like TypeScript definition files for Lodash's functional programming methods. Since the user is running git.exe, it seems they're working with a Node.js project where these types are being set up or updated.\n\nI should consider what's normal here. Developers using tools like git to manage their codebases often have Node.js modules installed, and cypress is a common testing framework. The creation of multiple type definition files in node_modules suggests that the user might be installing or updating dependencies, which is a standard part of development workflows.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206..., indicating this is likely a student's or personal project directory.

No unusual file names, execution of scripts from unexpected locations, or other red flags typically associated with cyberattacks.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object, and there are 17 of them in total. The first thing I notice is that every entry has the same structure: the process name is \"git.exe\", the task is \"File created\" with a specific rule mentioned, and the file path points to various \".d.ts\" files within a \"node_modules\" directory.\n\nThe user's query specifies that I should analyze the entire batch as a whole. That means I need to consider all these events together rather than individually. My goal is to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the JSON objects represents. The \"process\" field indicates that the git.exe process is responsible for the action. Git is a version control system, commonly used in software development, so its activity is fairly normal on a system where developers are working.\n\nThe \"winlog\" task mentions \"File created\", which is straightforward—this event logs when a file is created on the system. The rule associated with this task is \"FileCreate\", so it's part of the Windows logging mechanism for tracking file operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all lead to \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\" followed by different \".d.ts\" files. These are TypeScript declaration files, which are typically used in TypeScript projects to define interfaces and types without implementation.\n\nSo, putting this together, it seems like the git.exe process is creating multiple files in a node_modules directory related to Cypress, Lodash, and their type definitions. This activity is likely part of a developer's workflow—perhaps during a build or install process where these modules are being set up or updated.\n\nI should consider whether such activity is normal. Developers using tools like npm (which often uses git for version control) would regularly interact with node_modules directories, creating and updating files as dependencies change. Therefore, the creation of these .d.ts files by git.exe doesn't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nAnother angle to think about is the frequency and volume of these events. There are 17 file creations in quick succession, all related to the same directory and process. While it's possible for a script or build process to create multiple files at once, this could also be part of a legitimate update or installation happening in the background.\n\nI should also think about whether such activities correlate with known malicious behaviors. Typically, malware would exhibit different patterns—like attempting to write to system directories, creating hidden files, or accessing sensitive data. Here, all activity is confined to a user's downloads directory and within a node_modules folder, which is standard for development environments.\n\nAdditionally, considering the consistency across events: same process name, same task type, similar file paths with predictable naming conventions—all point towards legitimate operations rather than something anomalous or malicious.\n\nHowever, I shouldn't completely rule out the possibility of misuse. For example, if an attacker were using git.exe as part of a more sophisticated attack, they might create files in such directories to blend in with normal activity. But given the information provided—without any signs of unusual file contents, access times outside typical working hours, or attempts to modify restricted areas—it's unlikely.\n\nFurthermore, analyzing the timestamps of these events would be helpful. If they occurred over a short period and during a time when the user is typically inactive (like late at night), that might warrant closer investigation. But without specific timestamp data, it's hard to make that assessment.\n\nIn summary, each individual event appears benign, and when viewed collectively, there's no evidence suggesting malicious intent or unusual behavior beyond what's expected in a development environment using tools like npm and git.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is classified as **NOT INTERESTING** because they represent normal file creation activities by the `git.exe` process during typical software development workflows.

They all have similar structures: process name is \"git.exe\", the Windows log task is \"File created\" under the rule FileCreate, and the file path varies but seems consistent within a directory structure.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they're in a path that includes \"node_modules\", which suggests this is related to a Node.js project.

The repetition of similar events suggests a bulk operation, perhaps during an npm install or cache update.\n\nAlso, since all events are from the same process (git.exe) and relate to creating files in a known development directory, there's no red flag here. No evidence of file deletions, access to sensitive areas, or other suspicious activities is present.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it aligns with typical software development activities involving dependency management.

Each line is a JSON object with three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nFirst, the process name in every event is \"git.exe\". That suggests that Git is being used here, which is common for version control systems. The winlog task is consistently \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\", so it's logging the creation of files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\...\". This points to a user directory on Windows. The specific path continues into a course folder named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which I assume is for a software quality course. Within that, there's a \"node_modules\" directory, specifically under the \"cypress\" and \"lodash\" folders. These are typical directories when using Node.js packages like Cypress for testing and Lodash for utility functions.\n\nEach event has a different file being created, all with .d.ts extensions. These are TypeScript declaration files, which makes sense in a development environment where TypeScript is used. The files are part of the Lodash library's type definitions, which again aligns with standard development practices.\n\nSince all events involve Git creating files in a node_modules directory, it seems like this is related to a developer setting up or updating their project dependencies. The creation of multiple .d.ts files at once might be due to installing or reinstalling packages, which could trigger the creation of these type definition files as part of the build process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual processes, no access to restricted areas, and all activities are within a user's development environment. The repetition of creating these specific files is normal during package installations or updates.\n\nSo, putting it all together: this batch of logs shows a user performing standard development tasks with Git and Node.js packages.

The task in each case is \"File created,\" so it's about files being made. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under a node_modules directory within a course folder called \"Qualidade de Software.\" Specifically, these are TypeScript definition files (d.ts) from the lodash library inside the cypress types folder.\n\nI know that when you install Node.js packages, like Cypress here, it downloads and extracts modules into node_modules. Git might be involved in this process because sometimes version control systems track package.json and lock files, so installing dependencies could trigger a Git event if it's part of a script or setup.\n\nSince all these events are about creating files during a module installation, it seems normal for someone setting up or updating their development environment.

That tells me it's related to Git, which is commonly used for version control. So, the activity is happening within a Git repository context.\n\nThe winlog field shows that the task is \"File created\" with a specific rule, \"FileCreate\". This indicates that files are being created on the system.

They're all created by git.exe and are part of the node_modules directory within a project folder. This suggests that these logs are generated during a typical Git operation, possibly when installing or updating dependencies, as node_modules is where npm packages are stored.\n\nI don't see any unusual processes or file paths here.

There's no indication of any malicious activity like access to sensitive files, attempts to execute scripts from unexpected locations, or signs of data exfiltration.\n\nThe repetition of the same process and similar file operations without variation also makes me think this is part of a build process or an automated script, which is normal in CI\/CD pipelines or during development work.

That's a red flag because Git is commonly used in development environments and usually doesn't raise security concerns on its own.

These are TypeScript declaration files, which are standard in Node.js projects for type checking.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like Git is cloning or updating a repository where the Cypress testing framework is installed. The node_modules folder suggests that this is part of a software project's build process. It's normal during development to see multiple file operations as dependencies are being fetched or built.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like access to restricted files, unusual process names, or failed login attempts. All the events are related to creating TypeScript files in a typical project structure. This is more about how Git manages its repository's dependencies rather than anything suspicious.\n\nAlso, considering that all these files are under node_modules, it's part of the package installation process, which is expected when using npm or yarn with projects like Cypress and Lodash.

So when someone clones a repository or updates it, git might create or update files. These events seem to be about creating TypeScript definition files related to lodash, which is a JavaScript library. Cypress is a testing tool, often used with Node.js projects, so the presence of node_modules and cypress makes sense in that context.\n\nI don't see any unusual process names or file paths here.

Since these events are all tied to git.exe creating files in a typical project setup, there doesn't seem to be anything malicious or out of place.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools like git for malicious activities, but in this case, the activity looks normal—creating development-related files. There's no indication of file deletion, access outside the project directory, or other red flags that could suggest exfiltration or injection attacks.\n\nAlso, all events are consistent with each other; same process, similar file operations.
