{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can do so much on the system. The first few events show powershell being executed with different command lines, sometimes including \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\", which immediately makes me think of malicious activity since that flag allows running scripts that are normally blocked.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a file named \"teste.ps1\" being created and then deleted shortly after. That seems suspicious because attackers often create temporary files to execute commands and then delete them to cover their tracks. Also, the path for this file is in the Downloads folder, which might not be typical if it's just a script running.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, seeing them loaded together with other suspicious activities could indicate that powershell is executing malicious scripts or modules.\n\nAnother thing I spot is multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events for powershell.exe. These might be related to how the script is initializing or terminating, but in the context of other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThere are also some Registry value set tasks from both Explorer.EXE and mmc.exe, which aren't necessarily bad on their own. They could just be normal system operations. Plus, there's an event where a file is created by winlogbeat.exe, which I think is part of log shipping or monitoring software, so that's probably benign.\n\nI'm concerned about the overall pattern here. The repeated powershell executions with different command lines, especially using Bypass Execution Policy, creating and deleting files quickly, and loading multiple modulesâ€”these all add up to potential malicious behavior. It seems like someone is testing permissions or trying to execute code without leaving a trace for too long.\n\nThe justification is that the events show signs of potentially malicious activities involving powershell with execution policy bypass and file operations that are often used in attacks. The confidence level is high because multiple red flags are present, making it likely that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events including ExecutionPolicy Bypass and file operations indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. All these events are related to PowerShell.exe activities on the system.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple ImageLoad tasks where PowerShell is loading various DLL files. This could be normal as PowerShell might need these for execution. However, the specific paths like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are part of .NET framework, which is standard.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a script file in the user's Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. PowerShell creating temporary scripts isn't unusual, but it depends on what the script does. Here, the script is created and then immediately deleted, which could be a red flag because deleting a script might indicate an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's a Registry value set event, which in some cases can be used for persistence by attackers. But again, it's not definitive on its own. The last event mentions Execute a Remote Command, which is concerning because executing remote commands via PowerShell can be a vector for attacks like remote code execution.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple file operations, script creation\/deletion, registry changes, and remote command execution. These activities could indicate someone trying to execute arbitrary code, possibly malicious in nature. The script's deletion might suggest an attempt to cover tracks. While some actions are normal, the combination raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file operations and remote command execution involving PowerShell.exe could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
