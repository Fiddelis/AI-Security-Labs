{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal because it's a common utility used to display user information. Nothing malicious here on the surface, but I'll keep an eye out for how it's used.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The second and third entries show that powershell is accessing processes and modifying registry values. Powershell can be legitimate or malicious, so this could be a red flag. Looking deeper, the fourth event has a command line with some encoded strings. The string \"pass\" stands out, and it's looking for specific file types like .xml, .doc, etc., which might indicate an attempt to search for sensitive information.\n\nThe fifth to seventh events again involve powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. This repeated activity around powershell is concerning because attackers often abuse it for script execution and lateral movement.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. While this could be normal, the fact that it's paired with other suspicious activities makes me cautious. It might be part of a larger script trying to establish persistence or load malicious modules.\n\nThe eighth event is a file creation by powershell.exe in the Temp directory, specifically \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1\". This temporary script file might be testing the environment for certain policies or preparing to execute further commands. The same script is then deleted immediately after creation in another event, which is unusual behavior. Normally, scripts would run without creating and deleting files so quickly unless they're trying to avoid detection.\n\nThere are multiple events labeled as \"Provider Lifecycle\" with the same command line as before. This repetition suggests a process that's being restarted or part of a loop, possibly indicating an attempt to bypass security measures by restarting failed attempts.\n\nNotably, towards the end, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which is expected if this is a log management tool running on the system. Then, notepad.exe modifying a registry value isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of malicious activity, but in isolation, it seems benign.\n\nFinally, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is another normal process event, as URLMON is part of Windows for handling URLs.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments that search for sensitive data, coupled with the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, suggests potential malicious activity. The multiple attempts at Provider Lifecycle events might be an attempt to establish persistence or evade detection. While some events could be legitimate, the overall pattern points towards a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The log batch shows suspicious activities involving powershell.exe and temporary script creation, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"detailed_findings\": [\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"Process Creation\",\n      \"description\": \"whoami.exe was created.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event is powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll. That's not too unusual since PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks, but sometimes it's also used in attacks. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, another PowerShell command line with findstr and select-string looking for passwords. That seems suspicious because searching for keywords like 'password' could indicate data exfiltration or credential harvesting. This might be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process but can also be malicious if it's modifying registry keys inappropriately. However, since these are just registry changes without more context, I'm not sure yet.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is usually benign, but loading this DLL might be normal for some operations. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nFindstr.exe being called with similar search parameters as before. Another instance of searching for 'pass' in various file types. This repetition makes me think it's part of a larger script or malicious activity.\n\nMultiple registry writes from different processes, especially powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, so this could indicate something is being installed or configured maliciously.\n\nThere are several events where chrome.exe is modifying the registry. While Chrome does make some registry changes during normal operation, multiple such events might be worth looking into to ensure they're legitimate.\n\nA file creation event by winlogbeat.exe seems like it's part of log shipping, which should be standard if that's a monitoring tool in use.\n\nPutting all these together: PowerShell executing scripts with suspicious command lines, multiple instances of searching for sensitive information (passwords), and several processes making registry changes. These indicators could point towards malicious activity such as credential harvesting or persistence mechanisms. The repetition of the findstr commands is concerning, suggesting it's part of a larger script possibly looking through files for credentials.\n\nSo overall, this batch seems to indicate potentially malicious behavior that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command lines searching for sensitive data and repeated registry modifications, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nThe first few logs are all related to chrome.exe performing various tasks like loading an image, setting registry values, and making network connections. That seems pretty standard for a browser process. I don't see any red flags here; these are typical activities for Chrome as it runs.\n\nThen there's a log from powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is often used for malicious purposes, so this catches my attention. Creating files can be normal, but combined with other actions, it might indicate something suspicious. However, without more context on the content of that file or previous events, I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe sets registry values. Again, this is somewhat common for legitimate software to modify the registry, so unless there's evidence of unauthorized changes, I wouldn't classify these as malicious on their own.\n\nLooking further down, I see several instances of processes accessing each other (ProcessAccess), which might be normal inter-process communication. But it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use such actions to hide their activities.\n\nThere are entries for creating files with specific names like 'estrutura_ativo.txt' and 'unidade_geral_005_OnLogon', 'unidade_comum_005_OnStartup'. These file names don't immediately ring any bells, but the fact that they're being created by powershell.exe and cmd.exe makes me cautious. The command line for cmd.exe includes deleting scheduled tasks, which could be part of removing traces or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe schtasks.exe entries are about creating or deleting scheduled tasks, which is a common method for attackers to maintain persistence on a system. Deleting existing tasks might be an attempt to remove competing malware or to avoid detection by disabling security tools.\n\nThere's also a process create event for whoami.exe and some registry changes made by svchost.exe. These could be legitimate system processes, but they could also be part of an attacker's footprint if used maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a mix of normal user activity and actions that could potentially be malicious. The use of powershell.exe creating files and deleting scheduled tasks is concerning. Additionally, multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe might be part of legitimate operations but could also be indicators of tampering. The deletion of specific scheduled tasks via cmd.exe and schtasks.exe stands out as a possible attempt to remove monitoring tools or create persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because while some activities are normal, others like the use of powershell.exe for file creation and the manipulation of scheduled tasks could be signs of malicious behavior. However, without more context on the environment and the users involved, it's hard to be certain. The confidence level isn't super high, maybe around 0.6 or 0.7, because some of these actions could still be benign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially suspicious activities such as the use of powershell.exe to create files and manipulate scheduled tasks, which may indicate malicious intent.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. The fields include process details, Windows logs (winlog), and file information.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process: schtasks.exe with command_line deleting a task named \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems like someone is trying to delete a scheduled task. I wonder why they're doing that. Maybe cleaning up traces or preventing something from running automatically.\n\nNext event also involves schtasks.exe but just the image load of taskschd.dll. That's normal when using Task Scheduler, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThird event: svchost.exe accessing registry (RegistryEvent). Svchost is a common system process, and it interacting with the registry isn't unusual. Could be part of normal service operations.\n\nFourth event: cmd.exe being created. The command line isn't provided in this event, but I'll need to check later ones for more context.\n\nThen there's conhost.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is typically used by console applications, so again, unless it's doing something malicious, it might be normal.\n\nPowershell.exe accessed (ProcessAccess). Powershell is often used for both legitimate tasks and scripting, but it can also be a vector for attacks. However, without seeing actual commands or suspicious activity, it's hard to tell yet.\n\nWhoami.exe was run. That's usually just to check user permissions. Not suspicious unless used in conjunction with other activities.\n\nAnother powershell access. Hmm, multiple accesses might indicate script execution or something more involved, but alone, they're not conclusive.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe again with a command line: deleting the 'notepad.exe' process using wmic. That seems odd because why would someone delete Notepad? Maybe trying to remove evidence or disrupt normal operations.\n\nWMIC.exe was created and then loaded some DLLs (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll). WMIC is a powerful tool for remote management but can also be used maliciously. The use of wmic to delete processes could be an attempt to cover tracks or perform malicious actions.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances of cmd.exe accessing the registry and deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"componente_comum_Admin\". Deleting user accounts is a big red flag unless it's part of legitimate administration. If these accounts weren't supposed to be deleted, this could indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\nNet.exe and net1.exe are used with the '\/del' command to delete users as well. Using different commands (net vs net1) might be an attempt to bypass detection or use alternative methods for deletion.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of process deletions using wmic, cmd, and net commands; deletion of user accounts; powershell accesses which could be part of script execution. These activities could indicate someone attempting unauthorized access, possibly part of a larger attack campaign.\n\nI should also consider if these actions are part of normal maintenance or legitimate admin work. However, the combination—especially deleting system processes like Notepad and multiple user accounts—is concerning. It suggests potential malicious activity, such as removing evidence, disabling accounts to prevent access, or attempting to clear logs.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events does seem significant enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential unauthorized access or malicious activities. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Deletion**: schtasks.exe was used to delete a task named \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". This could be an attempt to remove traces of automated processes.\n\n2. **Process and DLL Loading**: WMIC.exe loaded several DLLs, including urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, which are typically associated with legitimate operations but can be exploited for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **User Account Deletion**: Multiple instances of cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe were used to delete user accounts like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"componente_comum_Admin\". This is concerning as unauthorized account deletions could indicate efforts to disrupt system access or remove evidence.\n\n4. **Powershell Access**: Powershell.exe was accessed multiple times, which, while legitimate for many tasks, can also be a vector for malicious scripting and execution.\n\n5. **Process Deletion with WMIC**: The use of wmic to delete processes like Notepad.exe might indicate an attempt to disrupt normal operations or remove logs.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities suggests potential malicious behavior, such as privilege escalation, evidence removal, or unauthorized access. These events warrant further investigation to assess the extent of any compromise and mitigate risks."}

I'm going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several cmd.exe and conhost.exe processes with tasks related to registry changes. That might be normal admin activity, but it could also indicate something malicious because changing registry values can affect system settings.\n\nThen, powershell.exe appears multiple times. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes. The tasks listed here are 'Process accessed' and some 'Registry value set', which makes me think of potential scripting or command execution activities.\n\nI notice specific commands like deleting users using net.exe and cmd.exe, such as \"net user ... \/del \/domain\". That's a red flag because it involves modifying user accounts. If this is happening without proper authorization, it could be part of an attack to delete legitimate accounts or create new ones.\n\nThere are also attempts to delete services with commands like \"sc delete win32times\" and using 'services.exe' which interacts with the registry. Deleting services can disrupt system operations, so that's concerning.\n\nLooking at all these together, there's a pattern of processes accessing the registry, creating new processes, and performing user deletions. This combination seems suspicious because it involves multiple high-privilege actions that could be part of an attack chain, maybe to remove traces or disable security features.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because it shows multiple indicators of potential malicious activity, all happening within the same batch.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, I've been given a batch of events in JSONL format, and my task is to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation as a cybersecurity expert. The output should be a single classification—either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\"—along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. Each line represents an event with details about the process, Windows log task, and file involved.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's a PowerShell.exe process accessing something via a registry event. That alone isn't too concerning since PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nThe second event shows cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory. This could be part of normal system cleanup or something more nefarious, like an attempt to remove traces of previous actions.\n\nNext, another PowerShell access with ProcessAccess task. Again, not inherently suspicious but worth keeping an eye on when combined with other events.\n\nThen, cmd.exe again setting a registry value. Registry modifications are common in attacks for persistence or configuration changes.\n\nFollowing that, cmd.exe deleting a specific file in the Temp directory. The fact that it's targeting .exe files might indicate an attempt to remove malicious binaries or perhaps just cleaning up after some activity.\n\nContinuing on, there's conhost.exe modifying the registry. Conhost is often used by attackers as it doesn't raise as many flags as other processes. Registry changes here could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nI notice a whoami.exe execution, which is typically used to check user privileges. This could be part of reconnaissance or credential gathering activities.\n\nMultiple events involve PowerShell with various tasks like ImageLoad and FileCreate\/Delete. These are classic indicators that PowerShell might be executing scripts, which can be malicious if the script is doing something harmful.\n\nThere's a file created and then deleted by PowerShell in the Temp directory. This pattern could indicate an attempt to execute code temporarily or remove evidence after execution.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated use of cmd.exe for deleting files, especially targeting specific .exe files in the Temp directory, is concerning. Conhost.exe and whoami.exe are red flags because they're often used in attacks. The extensive PowerShell activity with various file operations and registry changes also raises suspicions.\n\nThe combination of these activities—deleting files, modifying registry entries, creating and deleting temporary files with PowerShell, using conhost and whoami—strongly suggests potential malicious behavior. It looks like someone might be trying to cover their tracks or establish persistence on the system.\n\nTherefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation. The confidence level is high because multiple red flags are present across different processes and activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"justification\": \"The events indicate potentially malicious activity involving PowerShell, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe performing file deletions and registry modifications in the Temp directory, which could be an attempt to hide evidence or establish persistence.\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with powershell.exe. Powershell is often used for malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The events show tasks like Process Create, Image Load, File Create, Registry value sets, and others. This could be a red flag because attackers might use PowerShell to execute commands or drop malware.\n\nLooking at the specific actions:\n\n1. \"powershell.exe\" is being used multiple times. There are several instances where it's creating files in different paths. For example, one event creates a file in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That seems unusual because I don't recall legitimate scripts creating such files during normal operations.\n\n2. There are multiple Registry value sets by powershell.exe and other processes like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, etc. Frequent registry modifications can be a sign of malicious activity since attackers might try to persistence or alter system configurations.\n\n3. I also notice the use of whoami.exe being executed several times. While whoami is a legitimate tool used to check user information, repeated executions without a clear purpose could indicate an attacker trying to gather information about the system.\n\n4. There's an event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender directory. That path seems off because defender components are usually in ProgramData and don't expect powershell to load them unless it's part of a legitimate script, but it's suspicious.\n\n5. Other processes like calc.exe and notepad.exe accessing registry or loading images might seem normal, but when combined with the other events, especially the multiple powershell activities, it raises concern.\n\n6. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a config file is normal if it's part of log management, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, since it's not related to any malicious indicators itself, it might just be noise.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances performing various actions, including file creation, registry changes, and loading unexpected modules. The use of whoami.exe several times could indicate information gathering. These activities could be part of an attack chain like initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of powershell abuse, registry modifications, and repeated process creations points to potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious actions, including file creation, registry modifications, and loading unexpected modules.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of system log events. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`. Winlogbeat is typically used for collecting logs, so this seems normal unless there's something suspicious about the path or filename. The `.new` extension might indicate a backup, which could be part of a legitimate update process.\n\n2. Next, `powershell.exe` accessing processes. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting and can be malicious if used in attacks, but isolated instances without other signs might not be suspicious yet. I notice this happens twice, so maybe it's just a user running scripts.\n\n3. Then, `whoami.exe` is run with the command line pointing to its default location. This is a common system utility used to display user information. It doesn't seem suspicious on its own unless there are unusual access times or privileges involved.\n\n4. Another instance of `powershell.exe` accessing processes. Again, without additional context like code execution or network activity, this could be benign.\n\n5. Two events from `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` and `Calculator.exe` modifying registry values. Both are standard system applications. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations, so unless they're making unexpected changes, this isn't concerning.\n\n6. Multiple events from `chrome.exe` showing DNS queries and network connections. These are normal activities for a browser as it navigates to websites. The repeated DNS queries could be due to browsing or loading multiple resources, which is typical behavior.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch together, I need to determine if there's any combination of these events that raises red flags. \n\n- The use of `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file might be setting up for log collection, but without seeing other related activity like deletion of logs or unusual access patterns, it's not suspicious.\n- Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` could indicate script execution, which in some cases can be malicious. However, there's no evidence here of any command-line arguments that would suggest malicious activity (like invoking scripts or external commands).\n- The repeated DNS queries and network connections from Chrome are consistent with normal browsing behavior and don't point to anything nefarious on their own.\n- Registry modifications by standard apps like Calculator and ApplicationFrameHost are expected and not unusual.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of these events. While there are several entries, none of them occur in an unusually high volume beyond what's typical for a user session with multiple applications running. There's no sign of rapid succession or unusual timing that might indicate automated malicious activity.\n\nAnother angle is to check if any process trees show signs of spawning suspicious child processes or if there are lateral movements across the network, but from the given data, all events seem isolated without such patterns.\n\nIn summary, while each event on its own could potentially be monitored, the combination doesn't present a clear pattern of malicious behavior. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other attack indicators in this batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as log file creation, process access, registry modifications, and network\/dns queries from common applications like Chrome and Calculator. There are no signs of malicious behavior or unusual patterns in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
