{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. They've provided several JSONL entries, each with process, winlog, and file details.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each event represents. Looking at the first few entries, I see multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is being executed with command lines that create scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which suggests they're setting up tasks to run on startup or logon. The fact that these tasks are being registered under different names (like unidade_ativo, registro_geral) might indicate an attempt to schedule multiple malicious activities.\n\nThe process details show that PowerShell is being used with command-line arguments that execute calc.exe, which seems benign at first glance since it's a calculator app. However, in the context of cybersecurity, using such commands within scheduled tasks can be a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. The fact that they're setting these tasks to run at logon and assigning them to the Administrators group with highest privileges is concerningâ€”it could allow persistence and escalation of privileges.\n\nLooking further into the events, there are also entries where PowerShell.exe accesses registry values and processes create or access other files like mscoree.dll, which might be related to executing scripts or loading .NET framework components. This activity can be indicative of malicious code execution, especially when combined with multiple scheduled tasks being created.\n\nAnother point is that all these events come from the same process, PowerShell.exe, which is commonly used in attacks due to its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands without leaving obvious traces. The repetitive nature of creating similar scheduled tasks could be part of a larger script aiming to establish persistence on the system or deploy additional malicious payloads.\n\nConsidering the combination of all these events, it's not just one off but multiple instances that together form a pattern suggesting potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell for task creation and file access, along with registry modifications, raises suspicion about unauthorized access or malware attempting to maintain presence on the system.\n\nI should also consider if there are any legitimate reasons for such activities. While system administrators might use PowerShell for tasks, creating multiple scheduled tasks at logon with elevated privileges is less common unless part of a bulk configuration script. However, in most cases, especially in an enterprise environment, such actions would be monitored and flagged by security tools.\n\nIn conclusion, the batch shows several red flags that together suggest potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell to create multiple scheduled tasks, combined with registry access and file loading, indicates possible compromise or attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events you provided contains several entries related to **PowerShell.exe** processes and activities that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. Below is an analysis of the key points:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Multiple PowerShell.exe Instances:**\n   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed, including command-line arguments that suggest scripting activity.\n   - Some entries show the command line used to launch PowerShell, which includes creating scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Creation:**\n   - Several events indicate the creation of scheduled tasks (`Register-ScheduledTask`). For example:\n     ```json\n     \"command_line\": \"& {$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \\\"calc.exe\\\"...}\"\n     ```\n   - These commands suggest that a script is attempting to create tasks that will execute `calc.exe` at logon or startup.\n\n3. **Registry and File Activity:**\n   - There are entries indicating registry value modifications (`RegistryEvent`) and file loading events (`ImageLoad`).\n   - The files being loaded include `.NET framework components`, which could be related to script execution or other processes.\n\n4. **Process Access and Creation:**\n   - Entries show that `powershell.exe` is accessing other processes (`ProcessAccess`) and creating new processes (`ProcessCreate`).\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The repeated creation of scheduled tasks using `Register-ScheduledTask` with the same structure could indicate an attempt to create persistence mechanisms or execute malicious code at startup.\n- The use of `calc.exe` in the command line is suspicious because it is often used as a benign example, but in this context, it could be part of a larger payload delivery mechanism.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe batch of events shows signs of potentially malicious activity involving PowerShell and scheduled task creation. While not all these activities are inherently malicious, the combination of multiple `powershell.exe` processes, registry modifications, and scheduled task creation raises red flags that warrant further investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. I'm not a cybersecurity expert, but I'll do my best to analyze the given data.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL events provided, each line represents an event with process information, Windows log task details, and file path information.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is involved in tasks like loading images, creating files, deleting them, and even creating pipes. For example:\n\n1. Powershell.exe loads MpOAV.dll.\n2. It creates a temporary PowerShell script file.\n3. Deletes the same script file shortly after.\n\nThen, I see two instances where `powershell.exe` is used with command lines that create scheduled tasks. The commands are obfuscated but seem to execute calc.exe upon logon for users in the Administrators group. This looks suspicious because creating a task that runs at logon and elevates privileges could be part of persistence mechanisms or malware.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where `chrome.exe` is involved in setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome can make changes to the registry, especially if it's doing so for extensions or settings, repeated writes might indicate something malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, considering that other events are more concerning, this might not be the main issue.\n\nThe later events show multiple entries where `winlog` task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no associated process or file. This could imply remote code execution, which is definitely a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: The use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe as Administrator upon logon suggests possible unauthorized system changes. Malware often uses scheduled tasks for persistence. The temporary script file creation and deletion might be an attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself. Combined with the remote command executions, this batch shows signs of potential malicious activities.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it exhibits behaviors that are indicative of possible unauthorized access or malware activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activities, including creating and deleting a temporary script file, registering scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, and remote command executions. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. My goal is to determine if these logs as a whole are interesting enough for further investigation or not. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first line: it's an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loaded taskschd.dll. WmiPrvSE.exe is known to be related to Windows Management Instrumentation, which can sometimes be used by malware for persistence. But I don't know if this particular load is suspicious or just normal.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a legitimate process that hosts various services, but it's often targeted by attackers because of the number of services it can host. Repeated registry changes might be a red flag, especially if they're happening in quick succession or in areas not typically accessed by standard processes.\n\nThen there's an event where svchost.exe creates a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Creating files under the Task directory could indicate scheduled task creation. If this is done by a malicious process, it might be setting up persistence mechanisms or tasks to run at specific times. However, without more context on what the file contains, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nMoving on, there are two events where remote commands were executed. The fact that remote commands are being executed could indicate potential lateral movement in a network or unauthorized access. This might be part of an attack chain, especially considering other activities like registry modifications and file creations.\n\nThe next event involves powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder under a specific path related to PowerShell profiles. PowerShell is commonly used by both administrators and attackers for various tasks. Creating files in such locations could be legitimate, but it can also be a way to hide malicious scripts or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, there are other events where powershell.exe sets registry values, which might be part of setting up an environment for malicious activities.\n\nThen I see conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is often associated with command-line tools and sometimes used in attacks for executing commands. Again, it depends on what exactly the process is doing, but multiple registry modifications could indicate tampering.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe events: there are several instances where it's loading various DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These might be legitimate components loaded by Chrome to handle things like anti-malware scanning. However, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to hide their activities or inject malicious code into them.\n\nThere's also an event where chrome.exe is setting multiple registry values. If this happens frequently without a clear reason, it could suggest that something is trying to alter system configurations in a way that's not usual for Chrome.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that powershell.exe and conhost.exe are creating files in the user's Downloads folder. This might be part of data exfiltration or setting up drop points for additional malicious payloads. The filenames like entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt don't immediately ring alarm bells, but they could be part of a larger scheme.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple processes (svchost.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe) performing registry modifications, file creations in various directories, including system32 and user-specific folders. The combination of these activitiesâ€”especially the remote command executions and multiple file creationsâ€”could indicate a possible attack vector.\n\nHowever, I have to consider if this is just normal activity for a user running scripts or tools that interact with the system. For example, someone setting up scheduled tasks or using PowerShell for administrative purposes might generate similar logs. Without more context about the user's actions or known baseline behavior, it's challenging to definitively classify these events as malicious.\n\nBut given the volume of registry changes and file creations, especially by processes like svchost.exe which are often targets in attacks, it does raise some concerns. The remote command executions also add to the suspicion because they could be part of a broader attack campaign or exfiltration attempts.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no single smoking gun here, the aggregate of these eventsâ€”especially considering multiple potentially suspicious activities by different processesâ€”does warrant closer examination. It might not be an active breach yet, but it's definitely worth investigating to ensure nothing malicious is occurring.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Analysis:**\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits a series of events that collectively raise suspicion but do not conclusively indicate a breach. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **WmiPrvSE.exe Activity:** Loading taskschd.dll, which could be legitimate or part of malware for persistence.\n\n2. **SvcHost.exe Registry Changes:** Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe may indicate potential malicious activity, as attackers often abuse this process.\n\n3. **File Creation in Task Directory:** Creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks might suggest setting up scheduled tasks, possibly for persistence.\n\n4. **Remote Command Executions:** Two events of remote commands executed could be part of an attack chain or lateral movement.\n\n5. **PowerShell Activity:** Powershell.exe creating and modifying files, including in user-specific folders, which can be malicious if used to hide scripts or establish persistence.\n\n6. **Conhost.exe Registry Changes:** Further potential tampering, as conhost is sometimes used in attacks for executing commands.\n\n7. **Chrome.exe Behavior:** Loading DLLs and registry changes might indicate legitimate operations or possible injection of malicious code.\n\n8. **File Creation in Downloads Folder:** Powershell.exe creating files could be part of data exfiltration or payload drops.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile no single event is definitive, the combination of multiple suspicious activitiesâ€”registry modifications, file creations by various processes, and remote command executionsâ€”merits further investigation. These indicators suggest potential malicious intent, necessitating deeper analysis to determine if a breach has occurred."}
