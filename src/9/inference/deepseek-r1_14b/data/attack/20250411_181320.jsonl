The first few entries are from chrome.exe making network connections and DNS queries, which seems normal for a browser.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe appearing multiple times. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful, so that catches my attention. It accesses processes, writes to the registry, loads various .dlls, creates files in temporary directories, and deletes them quickly—red flags for script execution and potential malicious activity.\n\nThere are also repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks from powershell.exe, which might indicate it's running scripts or loading modules. The command lines show commands like 'ls -recurse' which list files recursively—a common tactic to gather info across the system.\n\nAdditionally, whoami.exe was run without any unusual flags, but when combined with powershell activity, it could be part of an attack chain for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a high probability that these events indicate malicious behavior, especially the extensive use of powershell with multiple indicators of compromise. So I'd classify this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated network activity and process creation involving potentially malicious PowerShell commands, including file creation and deletion in temporary directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. I'll go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst up, there are multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. The first event shows PowerShell loading an image (MpClient.dll), which seems normal as it's part of Windows Defender. However, the third event has a command line with `& {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}`. This looks suspicious because it's using several commands to recursively list items, possibly trying to gather information about the system or files, which could be part of recon before an attack.\n\nNext, I notice that PowerShell is creating files (`objeto_principal.txt`) and accessing registry values. Registry modifications can be concerning because attackers often use them to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. The fact that these actions are happening in sequence raises a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries where `svchost.exe` is modifying the registry. While svchost is a legitimate process for running services, it's also commonly used by malware to hide their activities. Multiple registry writes without clear justification could indicate malicious behavior, such as installing backdoors or altering system settings.\n\nThere are also events related to user account management and logon tasks. These can be signs of credential manipulation or unauthorized access attempts. The repeated 'User Account Management' logs might suggest an attacker trying to create new accounts or modify existing ones, which is a common step in privilege escalation.\n\nAnother point is the involvement of `winlogbeat.exe`, which I recognize as part of the ELK stack for log management. However, it's creating files in user directories, and there are multiple entries of `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. This could be normal if the service is being set up or updated, but considering other suspicious activities, it might warrant closer examination.\n\nLastly, processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe` and `notepad.exe` modifying registry values aren't inherently malicious, but in combination with other events, they contribute to a pattern of system changes that seem inconsistent with normal user activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple indicators of potential malicious activities: suspicious PowerShell commands, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, user account management changes, and logon events. These factors collectively suggest that this batch is indeed interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, including suspicious PowerShell commands, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, and user account management changes. These patterns suggest possible unauthorized system access or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. So, the logs are in JSONL format, each line being a JSON object representing an event.\n\nLooking at the first event: Process name is calc.exe, and it loaded urlmon.dll from C:\\Windows\\System32\\. The second and third events are both svchost.exe setting registry values. The fourth event is Calculator.exe loading the same urlmon.dll path as the first event.\n\nHmm, I know that calc.exe is usually innocent, but sometimes malware can disguise itself as legitimate processes. But in this case, both calc.exe and Calculator.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That's interesting because urlmon.dll is a known DLL used by URLMONITOR service for handling URLs. Malware often injects into legitimate processes like svchost or calc to hide their activities.\n\nWait, but the first and fourth events are different processes loading the same file. Could this be part of normal operation? Maybe not if it's happening multiple times or with unusual timestamps. The svchost.exe entries setting registry values could be suspicious too because svchost is a common process used by malware for persistence or other malicious activities.\n\nHowever, without more context like time stamps, user activity, or additional logs showing these events in sequence as part of an attack chain, it's hard to say definitively. But there are enough red flags here—calc.exe and Calculator.exe both loading the same DLL, along with svchost making registry changes—that might warrant closer investigation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because while individually some of these events could be normal, together they suggest possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (calc.exe and Calculator.exe) loading urlmon.dll, which is often associated with malicious activities. Additionally, svchost.exe registry modifications may indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
