{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and others. The initial entries are multiple instances of chrome.exe with network connection detections. That's pretty normal because Chrome often establishes connections, so these might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process being created. Whoami is usually used to check user information, which can be legitimate but sometimes also used by malicious actors to gather info. Not sure yet if it's bad, but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nNext, powershell.exe shows up multiple times with ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks. PowerShell is commonly used for both good and bad purposes. The fact that it's accessing processes and registry values might be a red flag, especially if combined with other activities.\n\nLooking further, there are cmd.exe instances executing csc.exe to compile C# files into executables. This seems like someone is compiling code on the fly, which could indicate malicious activity like creating custom malware or tools. The paths mentioned in the command lines look suspiciously temporary and obfuscated.\n\nThe creation of several .exe files in temporary directories by processes like csc.exe stands out. Creating executable files in temp folders without a clear purpose can be a sign of malicious behavior, especially when combined with other suspicious activities like registry modifications.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs and EXEs. While this is normal for running applications, the combination with other events might suggest that something is being loaded into memory unnecessarily or inappropriately.\n\nAlso, there's a process called RuntimeBroker.exe making registry changes. Runtime Broker is part of Windows, but unexpected registry modifications can be indicators of malicious activities.\n\nFinally, processes like notepad.exe and conhost.exe modifying the registry could be unusual. Notepad typically doesn't interact with the registry much unless it's being used for script execution or similar actions.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of creating executables in temp folders, using cmd to compile code, PowerShell accessing system components, whoami gathering user info, and several processes altering the registry. These activities collectively look like they could be part of an attack chain—maybe setting up persistence mechanisms, gathering information, or deploying malware.\n\nTherefore, I think this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation because it combines several red flags that often indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell access, whoami execution, and executable creation in temp folders suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and my task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. The classification should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each event in the batch. Each line represents a separate event with three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process: calc.exe\n- Winlog: Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\n- File: C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll\n\nThis indicates that the Calculator executable is loading the urlmon.dll library. That seems normal because many applications load system libraries.\n\nNext, I see multiple events involving svchost.exe with Registry value set tasks and no file path. Svchost.exe is a known Windows process used by services, so these could be legitimate operations unless there's something unusual about the registry changes.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK Stack component used for log management, so this seems benign—part of its normal operation to create or update configuration files.\n\nThere are also events involving ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing the registry, which again could be normal depending on what those processes do. Calculator.exe loading amsi.dll might be related to anti-malware scanning, which is standard behavior.\n\nThe powershell.exe entries catch my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. Each event involves registry access, which is common in scripts but could also be part of an attack. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or file creations, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events show several registry writes and some image loads, including amsi.dll. While Chrome regularly interacts with system libraries, the repeated RegistryEvent might warrant closer look, but not necessarily indicate malicious activity unless there's evidence of persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nI also notice that some file paths point to legitimate Windows directories (System32), which are expected locations for DLLs and executables. There's no indication here of files being created outside standard areas or executing from unexpected sources.\n\nIn summary, while there are multiple registry accesses across different processes, none of the events individually stand out as malicious without additional context. The combination doesn't reveal any clear signs of compromise like unusual file creations, network connections, or process injection. Most activities align with normal system behavior for these processes.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because while there are several events that could be monitored, they don't collectively indicate malicious behavior based on the information provided.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal system processes such as loading DLLs and registry operations. There is no indication of unusual or malicious activity across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
