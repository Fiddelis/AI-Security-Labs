{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events:\n\n1. PowerShell and whoami.exe executions are common for various legitimate tasks, so that's not suspicious on its own.\n2. There's repeated use of cmd.exe with command lines that create services using sc.exe. The script paths mentioned don't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1), which might be a red flag because attackers often use non-existent files to avoid detection.\n3. Services.exe and svchost.exe are involved in registry changes, which could indicate an attempt to create or modify system services, possibly for persistence.\n4. Some events show the creation of new processes like sc.exe and cmd.exe being used together, which is a technique sometimes used in attacks to execute commands and set up malicious services.\n5. Registry value sets across multiple processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, services.exe) could be part of an attack chain setting up persistence or modifying system configurations.\n6. The repeated use of sc.exe to create and query services might indicate an attempt to establish a persistent backdoor.\n7. Notably absent are file accesses or creations related to malicious scripts beyond the non-existing ones, which suggests potential attempts that didn't complete or were aborted.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's a pattern suggesting potentially malicious activity like service creation with suspicious script paths and multiple registry modifications. While each individual event might not be alarming, their combination raises concerns about a possible attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and sc.exe with command lines suggesting the creation of services pointing to non-existent scripts. This indicates potential malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence or deploying malware.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll go through each event one by one and see what they're showing.\n\nThe first eight events all show that the process is 'chrome.exe' with a task related to setting a registry value. That seems pretty normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for things like settings or extensions. I don't immediately see any red flags here; it's just standard operation for a browser.\n\nThe ninth event again involves 'chrome.exe', but this time, it's about an image being loaded into memory. The file path is pointing to 'amsi.dll', which I recognize as part of Windows Defender Antivirus. This also seems normal because legitimate software often loads system DLLs to function properly. So no cause for concern here.\n\nThe tenth event is where things get a bit more interesting. It's a process access event from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so this catches my attention. The task is labeled as 'ProcessAccess', which could indicate that another process is accessing or interacting with it. This kind of activity might be part of legitimate administration tasks, but it could also be a sign of something more sinister, like a script being executed to perform malicious actions.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together, I notice that most events are from Chrome and involve standard operations. The only outlier is the PowerShell process access event. While it's not definitive proof of malicious activity on its own, it does stand out in a sea of normal activities. The fact that it's just one event among many doesn't lower my confidence too much because even a single unusual event can be significant.\n\nI'm considering the possibility that this could be part of an attack chain, where an adversary uses PowerShell to execute malicious commands after initial access. Alternatively, it might just be a sysadmin performing routine tasks. Without more context or additional events showing suspicious behavior, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe confidence level here is moderate because while there's cause for investigation, the evidence isn't conclusive. The presence of the PowerShell process access event is notable but doesn't provide enough information on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a 'ProcessAccess' task from powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
