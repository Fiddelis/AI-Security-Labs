{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few entries are all about \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading image files like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems normal because these DLLs are common Windows components, so probably nothing malicious here.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to user account management without any process or file info. These could just be routine login or group policy updates, which aren't unusual.\n\nThen I see \"rundll32.exe\" being executed with a command line that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. Rundll32 is commonly used for running DLL functions, but the specific GUID might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThere are several entries of \"svchost.exe\" modifying the registry. Svchost is part of Windows services, and registry changes are normal during operation or updates. But frequent modifications could indicate something fishy, though not conclusive yet.\n\nThe \"winlogbeat.exe\" events show file creation in its own data directory. That's expected behavior since it's likely logging to that path, so nothing concerning here.\n\nTwo Excel processes starting and loading various DLLs. EXCEL.EXE is a common application, and these look like standard operations for launching the program. The DNS query from Excel might be checking online resources or updates, which isn't inherently suspicious unless there's an unusual domain being accessed.\n\nLastly, \"WmiPrvSE.exe\" running with wmiutils.dll. WMI is part of Windows management, but sometimes malware uses it. However, the process details here don't show any overt signs of malicious activity.\n\nOverall, while some events could be red flags on their own (like rundll32 and WmiPrvSE), there's no clear pattern or indication of a breach. The batch doesn't show high-risk activities like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malware signatures.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system processes and routine operations such as image loading, file creation, and registry modifications. There is no indication of malicious behavior or unusual activity that would warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of five events. All of them are from the same process, EXCEL.EXE, which is Microsoft Excel. The first two entries show that a file was created in the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\real_values.csv.LNK. The next three events are DNS queries initiated by the same process.\n\nI know that EXCEL.EXE is a legitimate application, so its activities should be normal unless there's something unusual about how it's being used. Let me thinkâ€”Excel typically creates files in the Recent folder to track documents opened by the user. So creating a file there isn't suspicious on its own. The DNS queries could be part of Excel trying to access online resources or check updates, which is also normal behavior for an application needing to connect to servers.\n\nPutting this together, all events seem within the expected scope for Excel's operation. There are no signs of unauthorized access, encryption attempts, unusual file accesses, or other red flags that would indicate malicious activity. The same process performing standard actions without any deviations from usual patterns doesn't raise concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Excel creating files and making DNS queries, which are normal operations for the application.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
