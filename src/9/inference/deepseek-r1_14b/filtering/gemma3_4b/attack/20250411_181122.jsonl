{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries that capture system log activities on a Windows machine.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is \"powershell.exe\". That catches my attention because PowerShell can be both legitimate for administrative tasks and potentially malicious for executing scripts. The command lines associated with these instances look suspicious. For example, one of them uses `findstr` to search for keywords like 'pass' in various file extensions, which might indicate an attempt to find sensitive information such as passwords. This kind of activity could be part of data exfiltration or credential harvesting.\n\nLooking further, I see that PowerShell is accessing the registry and creating files in temporary directories. Specifically, there's a script named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1\" being created and then deleted shortly after. This pattern—creating, running, and deleting scripts—is often used by malware to avoid detection. The deletion might be an attempt to clean up traces of their activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of \"Provider Lifecycle\" events tied to PowerShell. While I'm not entirely sure what this specifically entails, frequent provider-related activities can sometimes be red flags in certain contexts, especially when combined with other suspicious behaviors.\n\nThere are also entries where normal processes like `whoami.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `calc.exe` are involved. These are typically benign unless they're being used as part of a larger attack chain. In this case, the presence of these along with the PowerShell activities doesn't raise immediate concerns, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThe file paths like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\" and the use of temporary filenames suggest that the malicious script was run in a way that tries to stay under the radar. Temporary files are often used for short-lived processes, which could be part of an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, the fact that multiple events involve similar command lines and patterns indicates a possible automated or scripted attack. The repeated attempts to access certain registry values and load images in memory might be probing the system's configuration or attempting to inject malicious code.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—the suspicious PowerShell commands targeting sensitive keywords, the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, repetitive provider events—it seems like there's a high probability that this batch is indicative of malicious activity. The confidence level isn't 100%, but the combination of several red flags makes it more likely than not.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \" intéressante\": true,\n  \" raisons\": [\n    {\n      \"nom\": \"Utilisation suspecte de PowerShell\",\n      \"description\": \"Le script exécuté dans PowerShell cherche des mots-clés sensibles comme 'pass' dans divers fichiers, ce qui peut indiquer une tentative de vol de données ou de mot de passe.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"nom\": \"Création et suppression rapide d'un fichier\",\n      \"description\": \"Le script crée un fichier temporaire '__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1' puis le supprime rapidement, ce qui peut suggérer une tentative de dissimulation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"nom\": \"Accès répété au registre\",\n      \"description\": \"Les accès fréquents au registre par PowerShell peuvent être indicatifs d'une tentative de modification des paramètres du système ou d'exécution malveillante.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"conclusion\": \"Oui, ce lot d'événements semble intéressant et mérite une investigation plus approfondie pour détecter d'éventuelles menaces ou activités malveillantes.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. I need to analyze a batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's powershell.exe loading a file. Powershell can be malicious, so that's a red flag. The second event has a command line with 'findstr' searching for \"pass\" in various file types. That sounds like someone looking for sensitive info, which is suspicious.\n\nThe next few events show svchost.exe modifying registry values. While svchost is usually benign, multiple registry changes might indicate malicious activity, especially if they're unusual.\n\nThere's a Calculator.exe event loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is innocent, but why load that DLL? Maybe it's part of a payload, so that's worth noting.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe events: accessing processes, creating files, and modifying the registry. Powershell is often used in attacks, so multiple instances doing these actions could mean something's up.\n\nI also see conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe making registry changes. These are legitimate processes, but their actions here might be part of malicious behavior or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's a lot of activity from chrome.exe: creating pipes, modifying the registry, and DNS queries. While Chrome can do these things normally, the frequency is high. Maybe it's being exploited or running malicious scripts.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a file is probably just data collection, but I should check if it's behaving as expected.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell with suspicious commands, registry modifications by various processes, and unusual Chrome activity suggest potential malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because several red flags are present across different processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines searching for sensitive information (e.g., 'pass' in various file types), along with registry modifications and other process activities that may indicate malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm going through each event one by one and looking for patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few lines, they're all from chrome.exe showing different tasks like loading an image, setting registry values, and making network connections. These seem normal since Chrome does a lot in the background.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but I'll keep an eye on what's happening with PowerShell because it can be used for scripting both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nNext, multiple events show registry value sets from chrome.exe. Again, this is standard behavior for applications accessing system settings through the registry.\n\nI notice a lot of Network connection detections in chrome.exe. Since Chrome handles web traffic, these are expected and not suspicious on their own.\n\nLooking further down, there's another PowerShell creating 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. Two different files created by PowerShell might be part of some script execution. I should consider if this is unusual for the user or system.\n\nThen there are several instances where processes like cmd.exe and schtasks.exe are being used with command lines that delete scheduled tasks. The commands in cmd.exe remove specific tasks: \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Schtasks.exe is also used to delete tasks like \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" and \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks can be normal admin activity, but it might indicate something if these tasks were legitimate or part of a routine.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is run. This is typically used to check user permissions and is generally benign unless it's part of privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple processes accessing the registry, creating files, deleting scheduled tasks, and network activity from Chrome. While each individual action isn't necessarily malicious, the combination might be concerning. Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of a cleanup routine by malware to remove traces or disable system defenses. The use of both cmd.exe and schtasks.exe for task deletion is notable.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that two different PowerShell instances are creating files in the same user's Downloads folder raises an eyebrow. It's possible they're part of a script, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe high number of events from chrome.exe performing various tasks could also be suspicious if Chrome isn't being used actively or if these actions are out of the ordinary for typical usage.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's enough evidence that might suggest some form of unauthorized system manipulation. However, without more context about the user's behavior and system baseline, it's hard to be certain. The confidence level is moderate because while there are red flags, they could also be legitimate admin tasks or normal background processes.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several indicators that may suggest potential malicious activity, though not definitively conclusive. Key points include multiple deletions of scheduled tasks using cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, which might indicate an attempt to remove system defenses or erase traces. The creation of files by PowerShell instances could be part of a script, potentially malicious. While each action isn't inherently suspicious, their combination raises concerns. Thus, the events are deemed **interesting**.\n\n- **Risk Level**: Moderate\n- **Confidence**: 7\/10\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial Analysis**: Noted standard Chrome activity (network connections, image loading) and registry access.\n2. **Highlighted PowerShell Activity**: Two instances creating files in Downloads, possibly part of a script.\n3. **Scheduled Task Deletions**: cmd.exe and schtasks.exe used to remove tasks named with similar patterns, suggesting possible malicious intent.\n4. **whoami.exe Usage**: Typically benign but monitored for context.\n5. **Overall Assessment**: Combination of actions raises concern, though not definitive proof of malice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events are considered **interesting** due to potential signs of system manipulation and script execution, warranting further investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where various executables like schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, WMIC.exe, and net.exe are being run with different command lines. Some of these commands look suspicious to me because they involve deleting users or processes.\n\nFor example, I see a command in cmd.exe that says \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That seems like someone is trying to terminate the Notepad process using WMIC, which can be a way to hide activity. Also, there are commands like \"net user \/del\" and \"net1 user \/del\", which indicate attempts to delete user accounts. Deleting users, especially with Administrator privileges as indicated by \"_Admin\" in the usernames, could be signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe multiple times is also notable because PowerShell can execute commands that are hard to trace and often used for malicious purposes. The process accesses and registry modifications could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or modifying system configurations to hide malicious activities.\n\nI also notice several instances where the same processes are being created and accessed, which might indicate repeated attempts at certain actions. Additionally, the fact that different tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe are being used suggests a varied toolkit, possibly to bypass detection mechanisms or to carry out multiple stages of an attack.\n\nPutting this all together, these events seem to show a series of potentially malicious activities: deleting user accounts, terminating processes, and using tools commonly associated with attacks. The combination of these actions across multiple processes increases the suspicion that something is amiss. While it's possible some of these could be legitimate admin tasks, the volume and variety make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains numerous events involving potentially malicious activities such as user deletion attempts, process termination using WMIC, and multiple PowerShell executions.

The goal is to determine if the entire batch should be flagged as interesting or not based on the logs provided.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. **Conhost.exe** and **Powershell.exe** are involved multiple times. Powershell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. However, repeated access without obvious purpose could be suspicious.\n2. There are several events where **Registry values are being set** or objects modified. This is concerning because attackers commonly use registry modifications to maintain persistence or hide their tracks.\n3. The command lines for some processes stand out:\n   - `cmd.exe \/c net user \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain` deletes a user account, which could be part of privilege escalation or cleanup after an attack.\n   - Similarly, commands like deleting services (`sc delete win32times`) might be attempts to remove traces of malicious activities.\n4. **Services.exe** modifying registry objects could indicate tampering with system services, often seen in attacks aiming for persistence.\n\nThe combination of multiple powershell executions, registry modifications, and user deletions suggests a coordinated effort that might be malicious.

Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where cmd.exe is being used with commands like deleting files in the Temp directory. That could be suspicious because malicious actors often delete logs or temporary files to cover their tracks. The specific files mentioned, like \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe,\" don't ring any immediate bells, but the act of deleting files is a red flag.\n\nNext, there are several instances where powershell.exe is being executed. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate admin tasks and for malicious activities. The command lines show \"& {}\" which seems odd; it might indicate that the script is trying to hide or not properly logging commands, which could be a sign of obfuscation.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Registry value sets by cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Malware often modifies the Windows Registry to maintain persistence between sessions. Each time they set a registry value without a clear purpose raises suspicion.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe is run, which could be used to gather user information or verify permissions. This might be part of reconnaissance activities before more malicious actions.\n\nPowershell.exe creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1.\" The creation and deletion within a short time frame could indicate an attempt to execute code without leaving evidence, which is common in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. While this isn't inherently malicious, it does show that multiple components are being loaded, which might be part of a larger script execution.\n\nThe combination of deleting files, using powershell with unusual commands, modifying the registry, and creating\/deleting temporary files suggests potential malicious activity. These behaviors could indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts or establish persistence on the system.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear indicators that these activities are legitimate, like associated user logons or known processes. The repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with such commands makes me lean towards this batch being indicative of potential malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, I classify this as INTERESTING due to the suspicious patterns in file operations, process creation, and registry modifications, which together suggest possible attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory, powershell.exe executing with potentially malicious commands, and several Registry modifications.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe being run with a command line argument that seems incomplete or possibly obfuscated. The task is 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be normal for PowerShell starting up, but the command line looks suspicious because it's cut off and could indicate something malicious trying to hide its command.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems okay because Defender uses PowerShell for some tasks, but I'm keeping an eye on how this is used in the context of other events.\n\nThen, a file is created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory. This could be storing configuration or scripts run at startup. If this file was written by PowerShell, it might be part of legitimate scripting, but if it's unexpected, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere are several registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The fact that multiple processes are making registry changes is a bit concerning, especially since they're happening in quick succession.\n\nLooking further, I see whoami.exe being executed. While this is a legitimate tool to check user information, it's often used by attackers to gather system information. The fact that it's called multiple times without obvious reason could be a red flag.\n\nThere are numerous 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe and other processes. These might indicate lateral movement within the network if an attacker is using process injection or other techniques to maintain persistence.\n\nI also notice that winlogbeat.exe creates files in its data directory, which seems normal if it's part of log management. However, the exact same file path appears multiple times, suggesting repetitive behavior that could be automated—potentially by malicious software trying to log activity or exfiltrate data.\n\nOther events involve RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe making registry changes. Svchost is a common process for services, but repeated registry writes without clear reason might indicate something is amiss. Notepad and calc.exe are also involved in image loading, which could be normal, but the overall pattern raises suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell executions with potential obfuscation, suspicious file creations, repetitive registry modifications across different processes, use of whoami for information gathering, and repeated process accesses. These behaviors collectively point towards possible malicious activities like script execution, persistence mechanisms, data collection, and lateral movement within a network.\n\nWhile some individual events might not be concerning on their own, the combination suggests a potential attack chain being executed.

Powershell can be tricky because it's commonly used for legitimate tasks but also often abused by attackers. The second event is whoami.exe running, which usually just tells the user their privileges—seems harmless on its own.\n\nNext up are two more powershell.exe accesses and then some other processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing registry values. I know that accessing the registry isn't inherently bad, but attackers might use it to hide persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the rest, there's a bunch of chrome.exe events: DNS queries and network connections. Chrome doing DNS makes sense because it's probably loading websites, and multiple connections could be normal if the user is browsing several sites or streaming content. However, too many connections might raise an eyebrow, but in this case, they're all from the same process.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has a mix of standard activities—browsing with chrome, using system tools like Calculator—and some powershell activity which could be concerning.
