{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few lines are all from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups when browsing the web. Not too suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an entry for whoami.exe being executed. Using whoami is common, often used to check user permissions or get system info, so unless it's part of some larger activity, maybe not alarming yet.\n\nNext, I see several powershell.exe events. Powershell can be a red flag because it's a powerful tool that can execute scripts and has legitimate uses but is also abused for malicious activities. Looking closer at the command line in one event, there's some Base64 encoded or XORed code. That's a big clue. Obfuscating code often indicates attempts to hide malicious actions.\n\nThe script in question seems to be doing something with encoding and making an HTTP POST request to example.com. The fact that it's XORing the plaintext suggests they're trying to hide the data being sent, which could mean exfiltration of sensitive information or some kind of command and control communication.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes, writes to the registry, loads images, creates files, deletes them, and opens pipes. These activities in combination can be signs of a potential malicious payload. Creating temporary files and deleting them quickly is a common tactic to avoid detection, so that's another red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions with obfuscated code, network connections, file operations, and registry changes. This looks like a classic pattern for malware or an attacker trying to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. So the batch as a whole is definitely interesting because of the suspicious activities involving powershell and potential data being sent out.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including XOR encoding and network communication attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the batch of system logs provided is relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all involve powershell.exe processes with a specific command line. The command line seems suspicious because it's using XOR encryption on some plaintext data and then sending it via an HTTP POST request to example.com. This could be an attempt to exfiltrate data or establish communication with a remote server, which is often a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe plaintext includes the string \"Path\" followed by \"C:\\Users\\ victim\", which looks like a file path that might be sensitive. The fact that it's being encrypted and sent suggests that the attacker is trying to hide the information they're sending out.\n\nI also notice that multiple events have similar command lines, indicating repeated attempts or part of a process. This repetition could mean that the script is running multiple times, perhaps in an attempt to send data periodically or handle different parts of an attack.\n\nAnother point is the use of Invoke-WebRequest without keeping the connection alive (DisableKeepAlive), which might be to avoid detection by some systems that track persistent connections. The URL being example.com is a common domain used in examples and could be a placeholder, making it harder to trace.\n\nLooking at other events, there's an instance where the task in winlog changes from 'Provider Lifecycle' to 'Engine Lifecycle'. This variation might indicate different stages of the process or potential attempts to bypass certain monitoring techniques by varying the activity type.\n\nAdditionally, there are some events involving file paths for MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll being loaded. These are legitimate Windows files, but their loading in conjunction with powershell.exe could be part of a broader attack vector, such as using known binaries for malicious purposes or lateral movement within a system.\n\nThe event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new configuration file (.winlogbeat.yml.new) might not be directly suspicious on its own, but considering the other activities, it's worth noting that log collection tools could be targets in an attack to either capture information or disrupt logging mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the consistent use of powershell.exe with encrypted data transmission, repeated command lines, and variations in task types suggest potential malicious behavior. The encryption, exfiltration attempts, and possible lateral movement indicators make this batch of logs concerning for cybersecurity threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs exhibit several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive Suspicious Powershell Activity**: Multiple events show powershell.exe executing the same script with XOR encryption and data transmission to example.com. This pattern suggests an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive information or establish communication with a remote server, commonly seen in cyberattacks.\n\n2. **Encrypted Data Transmission**: The script encrypts plaintext data containing \"Path\" and file paths, which could be sensitive information. Sending encrypted data may indicate an effort to hide the transmitted content from monitoring systems.\n\n3. **Use of Invoke-WebRequest**: The use of this cmdlet without keeping connections alive might be to avoid detection mechanisms that track persistent connections, further suggesting malicious intent.\n\n4. **Variation in Task Types**: Events show tasks labeled 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', possibly indicating different stages or attempts to evade monitoring by varying activity types.\n\n5. **Loading Legitimate Binaries**: The loading of MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll by powershell.exe could be part of an attack vector, potentially using these legitimate files for malicious purposes or lateral movement within a network.\n\n6. **Log Collection Tool Activity**: winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file might not be suspicious alone but is notable in the context of other activities, as attackers may target such tools to disrupt logging or capture data.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of encrypted data transmission, repeated powershell activity, and potential indicators of lateral movement strongly suggests that this batch of logs is relevant for further investigation. These activities could indicate a cybersecurity threat, such as data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or other malicious operations. Immediate action is recommended to assess the extent of any compromise and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries from different processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, and others. Each of these has various tasks associated with them, such as file creation, registry value changes, process access, DNS queries, image loads, etc.\n\nStarting with powershell.exe: I see several entries where it's either creating files or accessing the registry. Powershell is a common tool for both legitimate use and malicious activities. Unusual activity here could be suspicious, but sometimes it's just normal usage. However, multiple registry changes might indicate something more.\n\nConhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe also have registry events. Conhost.exe is typically used to host console windows for background processes, so if it's making registry changes, that might not be standard behavior unless part of a legitimate update or configuration change.\n\nSVCHOST.EXE appears multiple times with registry tasks. Since svchost.exe runs various services, some legitimate activities could involve registry modifications. But repeated writes might raise flags depending on what the service is doing.\n\nCalculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are also showing up with image loads of urlmon.dll. That seems a bit odd because these processes shouldn't be accessing such DLLs unless there's an exploit or they're being used maliciously.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe has file creation events, which makes sense if it's part of log management software like the Elastic Stack. But sometimes attackers might use similar names to hide their tools.\n\nChrome.exe is appearing quite a few times with multiple registry writes and image loads. While Chrome can access various system files for its operations, too many such events could indicate tampering or malicious extensions.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: There are several instances where legitimate processes like powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and svchost.exe are making unusual registry changes. Additionally, non-standard file creations and image loads in unexpected processes (like Calculator.exe) might be red flags.\n\nI'm noticing that powershell.exe is involved multiple times with both file creation and registry modifications. This could indicate script execution or persistence mechanisms. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks across different processes also stand out; attackers often use the registry to maintain persistence, store configuration data, or inject malicious code.\n\nThe event where Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll is particularly concerning because it's unexpected for such a process to interact with that DLL, which might be related to URL handling and could indicate a potential exploit.\n\nAdditionally, winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory might just be part of its log rotation, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, combined with the other events, it adds some level of concern.\n\nThe high number of RegistryEvent tasks across multiple processes is another point of interest. Legitimate software usually doesn't make so many registry changes in a short period unless something unusual is happening.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows several signs that could indicate malicious activity: multiple suspicious processes making registry changes, unexpected file creations, and image loads in non-standard contexts. However, without more context or time-based analysis, it's challenging to definitively conclude. But based on the patterns observed, there are enough red flags to suggest further investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity. Key points include multiple registry modifications by various processes, unexpected file creations, and unusual image loads in non-standard contexts. These signs, particularly the repeated RegistryEvent tasks and suspicious process behaviors, warrant further investigation to assess the risk and determine if malicious actors are present.\n\n**Final Answer:** The logs contain several red flags suggesting possible malicious activity, making it an interesting case for investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're worth investigating. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is being executed. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. The command lines show file deletions using `Remove-Item`, which could indicate an attempt to erase evidence or remove malicious files after they've been used.\n\nI notice that these PowerShell commands are trying to delete specific batch scripts from various paths, such as \"modulo_principal\" and \"registro_logico_script.bat\". This suggests someone is cleaning up after themselves, possibly erasing logs or malicious scripts. The fact that multiple files are being deleted in different locations makes me think this isn't just a one-off event but part of a larger operation.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, these events happen within a short period, which adds context. Rapid, repeated deletions could be an attempt to cover tracks quickly. Additionally, some events show file creation and deletion, like creating a temporary script and then deleting it right after—this is common in attacks to test permissions or execute code without leaving long traces.\n\nThere are also registry access events from both PowerShell and Chrome. While Chrome might have legitimate reasons to interact with the registry, repeated registry changes can be signs of malicious activity trying to persist on the system or modify configurations to hide their presence.\n\nAnother point is the loading of various .NET and runtime DLLs by PowerShell. This could be part of executing scripts that require certain libraries, but it's also a tactic used in attacks to load malicious code or obfuscate payloads.\n\nThe combination of multiple file deletions, especially targeting specific script files, along with registry modifications, makes me concerned about potential malicious behavior. The use of `Remove-Item` commands suggests deletion attempts, which are often part of an attacker's cleanup process after executing a payload.\n\nWhile some events might be benign (like legitimate script execution), the volume and pattern here—especially multiple deletions from different paths and repeated registry accesses—make this batch stand out as suspicious. I'm leaning towards classifying it as interesting because these behaviors could indicate an attack, such as data exfiltration or file deletion to cover tracks.\n\nI should also consider if there's any indication of successful unauthorized access. The repeated attempts to delete files across different directories might be part of a broader campaign to remove evidence or install malicious components elsewhere on the system.\n\nOverall, the pattern of events points towards potential malicious activity that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of file deletions using PowerShell suggest potential malicious activity aimed at removing evidence or malicious scripts.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few entries all involve `powershell.exe` with command lines that execute `Remove-Item` commands. These are attempts to delete specific files, like `.bat` scripts located in various directories. The paths being deleted look somewhat structured but don't immediately ring any bells as common attack vectors. However, repeated deletions might indicate an attempt to cover tracks or part of a larger malicious process.\n\nNext, there's an event where `powershell.exe` loads the `MpClient.dll`, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal unless it's being loaded in an unusual way. Then, another PowerShell instance creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This could be for persistence but isn't conclusive on its own.\n\nI notice several events where various executables like `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe` are being used with command-line arguments. For example, `sc.exe` is used to stop and delete services (`objeto_temporario` and `estrutura_secundario`). This could be an attempt to disable security-related services or remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nThe events also show multiple registry access operations by several processes. `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others are modifying the registry, which is a common tactic in malware for persistence or configuration changes. The fact that these events are spread across different processes suggests potential coordination between them.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a mix of process creations, file deletions, service management via SC.EXE, and registry modifications. While each individual event might not be alarming, the combination raises concerns. It seems like someone is attempting to clean up or modify system configurations, possibly after deploying malicious code. The repeated use of PowerShell for deletion and registry changes, along with command-line tools for service manipulation, fits a common post-exploitation behavior.\n\nHowever, without more context, such as timestamps indicating rapid succession or known indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to definitively classify this as malicious. It could also be legitimate system administration activity, especially if the deleted files were unnecessary or part of a cleanup script.\n\nStill, the frequency and variety of these events do suggest some level of potential threat activity. There might not be enough evidence yet for high confidence in malignancy, but they're certainly worth closer examination to rule out malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell and command-line executions, including attempts to delete files using Remove-Item and SC.EXE commands, as well as registry modifications.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is a command prompt deleting a file in the temp directory. That seems normal unless it's part of something else.\n\nNext, there are multiple PowerShell executions. I know that PowerShell can be used maliciously, but sometimes admins use it for legitimate tasks. However, seeing so many instances might raise flags.\n\nThere's also an 'whoami.exe' execution, which is often used to check user permissions. If this happens in a sequence with other scripts, it could indicate privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the file operations, I see files being created and deleted in temporary directories. This is common for scripts but can be part of malicious activities like creating droppers or staging areas.\n\nRegistry modifications are present as well. Changing registry values can configure system settings, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior, which is a red flag.\n\nThe events show several attempts to load .NET frameworks and other DLLs. This could indicate that scripts are trying to execute in a certain environment or loading malicious components.\n\nThere's an interesting sequence where a PowerShell script file is created and then immediately deleted. That might be an attempt to bypass some logging mechanisms by not leaving the file around long enough to detect.\n\nAlso, there are events from winlogbeat creating configuration files. If this tool is running legitimately, it's normal, but if it's part of an attack, it could be used for exfiltration or persistence.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might indicate that PowerShell is being invoked multiple times, possibly as part of a script execution loop or module loading.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions, file operations in temp directories, registry changes, and repeated attempts to load specific DLLs suggests potential malicious activity.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several instances where PowerShell is being executed. That's not necessarily bad on its own because admins often use it for legitimate tasks. But the way it's being used here might be a red flag. The command lines show things like removing files in the TEMP directory and accessing registry values multiple times. Also, there are events where cmd.exe is deleting files and accessing the registry too.\n\nLooking at the file operations, I notice that PowerShell is creating files in user directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft... That seems a bit suspicious because those aren't standard locations for temporary files created by scripts. Plus, there's an attempt to delete a .exe file in the TEMP directory using cmd.exe, which could indicate some malicious activity trying to clean up traces.\n\nThe registry modifications are happening quite a bit too. Malware often uses the registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations. The fact that both PowerShell and cmd.exe are accessing and modifying registry values repeatedly makes me think there might be something nefarious going on.\n\nThere's also a command where whoami.exe is run, which usually gives user information. If this is part of an attack chain, it could be for privilege escalation or to gather system info. Combined with the other activities, this adds up.\n\nI'm noticing that some of these events are repeated, like the removal of key.log in TEMP and multiple ImageLoad tasks. Repetitive actions might suggest automation or a script running multiple times, which is common in attacks to ensure persistence or execution.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events could be benign, the combination—multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines, file deletions in non-standard locations, registry modifications, and use of cmd.exe for deletion—points towards potential malicious activity. The repetitive nature also raises flags because attackers often run scripts multiple times to ensure success.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows a pattern that could indicate an attack.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events are related to powershell.exe processes. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used in cyberattacks for its scripting capabilities. The fact that there are multiple entries from the same process suggests potential malicious activity or at least something worth closer examination.\n\nLooking deeper, I see several ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs. While some of these might be legitimate system operations, others like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll caught my eye because they're related to Windows Defender. It's unusual for PowerShell to interact directly with Defender components unless there's an attempt to bypass or manipulate the antivirus.\n\nThere are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events involving a temporary .ps1 file. This could indicate that a script was created and then deleted, possibly to avoid detection. The fact that it's named __PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1 seems arbitrary, which makes me think it's trying to hide its tracks.\n\nI also notice multiple RegistryEvent tasks in powershell.exe. These could be attempts to modify system configurations or establish persistence points for malware. The use of 'whoami.exe' is another point; while it's a legitimate tool, its execution alongside other PowerShell activities might indicate an attempt to gather user information or escalate privileges.\n\nThe command lines show Powershell executing scripts that remove files in the TEMP directory, specifically key.log. This could be an effort to delete logs related to system activity, possibly to cover tracks after malicious actions.\n\nIn summary, while some of these actions could be part of normal operations, the combination—especially the file deletions, registry modifications, and interactions with Defender components—points towards potentially malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to powershell.exe. There are multiple entries where powershell is either starting, loading images, or accessing files and registry keys. That could be normal user activity, especially if someone is running scripts or using PowerShell regularly.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they show powershell.exe loading various DLLs like clrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. These might be legitimate components used by PowerShell to function properly. However, I also see that a file was created in the Temporary folder named __PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1 and then deleted shortly after. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting script files quickly could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or execute malicious code.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is being accessed, which might suggest some process monitoring or interaction with other processes. I also spot a few instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a common tool used to check user information and permissions, so that alone doesn't raise red flags unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother point is the use of command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems unusual. Normally, you might see powershell.exe followed by script paths or commands in quotes. This format could be an attempt to execute arbitrary code or load malicious scripts.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses other processes, which could indicate process injection or lateral movement within the system. However, without more context on what exactly is being accessed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe last few events involve winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which is likely part of log shipping or monitoring solutions and probably not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch shows significant PowerShell activity with some concerning behaviors like quick script creation\/deletion, unusual command-line arguments, multiple process accesses, and repeated whoami executions. While these actions can be legitimate, the combination raises suspicion that something malicious might be happening, such as script testing for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the activities, when viewed collectively, could signal potential malicious behavior.

Let me look through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where PowerShell.exe is being accessed. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But just accessing it doesn't necessarily mean something bad—users might run scripts or tools that use PowerShell legitimately.\n\nThen there are several instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a standard Windows command-line tool that displays information about the current user. It's commonly used to check permissions or debug issues, so seeing it here isn't immediately suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, I see some events where PowerShell accesses the registry (Registry value set). That's a bit concerning because malicious actors often use the registry to persistence their tools or change system configurations. However, legitimate software can also write to the registry for various reasons, so I need to consider context here.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple instances of Process Create events for both PowerShell and whoami.exe. This repetition might indicate a script or automated process running these commands repeatedly. If this were part of an attack, perhaps it's trying to gather information or execute commands in a loop. But without additional data like timestamps or other related activities, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping and monitoring, so that seems benign unless there's something unusual about how it's being used here. The filename looks standard, so I don't see any immediate issues there.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are elements that could raise suspicions—like multiple PowerShell accesses and registry changes—the lack of clear malicious indicators makes me cautious. There's no evidence of actual data exfiltration, known malicious commands, or unusual file creations. The events seem to be a mix of legitimate system queries and potentially exploratory behavior.\n\nI also consider the frequency: there are 14 events in total with multiple repeats of similar processes. This could be part of normal user activity, especially if someone is running scripts or troubleshooting. Without more context like timestamps showing rapid succession or anomalies in permissions, it's hard to conclude malice.\n\nSo overall, while there are some flags, they don't rise to the level of being clearly malicious without further information.
