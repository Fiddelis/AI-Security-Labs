{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. My job is to figure out if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object containing process details, winlog tasks, and file information.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n1. RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value.\n2. powershell.exe accessing a process.\n3. calc.exe loading an image from urlmon.dll.\n\nI notice that there's a mix of legitimate processes like Calculator, Chrome, and Windows-related services (like svchost.exe). These are common system processes, so they don't immediately raise red flags on their own.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe appearing multiple times with tasks like 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated access might be something to look into. However, without seeing any command lines or suspicious file accesses, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThere are a few instances where cmd.exe is involved in deleting processes using wmic. The command line \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\" caught my attention because it's an unusual activity—why would the system be trying to delete Notepad.exe? That could be suspicious, but I don't have context on why this was executed.\n\nI also notice WMIC.exe being used with commands like \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". WMIC is another tool that can be used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities. The combination of wmic and deleting processes adds to the concern, especially since Notepad isn't a typical target for deletion.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where Registry values are being set by various processes like svchost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and others. While modifying the registry is normal for some system processes, frequent writes without clear justification might indicate malicious activity trying to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nI also see that Calculator.exe and WMIC.exe are loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL used for URL handling. But in some cases, attackers may load malicious modules using such known files to avoid detection.\n\nThe batch as a whole shows several red flags:\n- Multiple uses of PowerShell and cmd.exe with wmic commands.\n- Attempts to delete Notepad.exe processes, which seems unusual.\n- Frequent registry modifications by various system processes, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n- Loading urlmon.dll by Calculator.exe and WMIC.exe—though not inherently malicious, it's worth monitoring.\n\nHowever, I don't see any clear evidence of a successful attack or data exfiltration. The events seem to indicate an active attempt to manipulate system processes, possibly indicating a potential breach or APT activity. Given the combination of process deletions, registry modifications, and use of tools like wmic and powershell, it's likely that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities including deletion attempts on Notepad.exe, use of cmd.exe with wmic commands, frequent registry modifications, and loading urlmon.dll by non-standard processes indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit unusual because Chrome is a browser; it doesn't typically interact with the registry in ways that would set values. But maybe it's just part of its normal operation? I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run a couple times. Whoami is often used to check user permissions, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of reconnaissance. It's interesting because it might indicate someone probing the system.\n\nPowershell.exe appears quite a few times with different tasks. Powershell can do a lot, both legitimate and malicious. The fact that it's accessing processes and setting registry values makes me cautious. Malware often uses Powershell for its scripting capabilities to execute commands or modify system settings stealthily.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are instances where cmd.exe is used with various commands like copying files and deleting tasks. Specifically, I see a command that deletes a scheduled task using schtasks. That could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity or prevent certain actions from being executed automatically.\n\nThere's also a mention of sethc.exe being copied over, which is known as a legitimate system file but can sometimes be used by malware to gain persistence or hide processes. Then, there are references to svchost.exe and conhost.exe interacting with the registry. SvcHost is a common process for running services; if it's modifying the registry, that could be part of legitimate operations, but it's another red flag because attackers might abuse it.\n\nAnother point is the multiple RegistryEvent tasks across different processes like chrome.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe. Unusual registry modifications can be indicators of malicious activity since attackers often need to modify system configurations for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nConsidering all these events together: repeated use of Powershell with varied operations, attempts to delete scheduled tasks, copy potentially suspicious files, and multiple registry modifications across different processes—this seems like a coordinated set of activities that could be indicative of a cyberattack. The combination suggests possible malicious behavior, such as establishing persistence, gathering information, or covering tracks.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior. While some actions might occur in legitimate scenarios, the frequency and combination point towards potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including repeated use of PowerShell for process access and registry modifications, deletion of scheduled tasks, and copying files potentially indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Then there's a cmd.exe creating a process, followed by conhost.exe accessing the registry. Chrome also accesses the registry in another event, which is typical for some applications.\n\nI notice multiple powershell.exe entries: it accesses processes, reads or writes to the registry, loads various DLLs, and even creates a file in a temporary directory. While PowerShell is commonly used for system administration, it's often targeted by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's creating a new script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1) could be suspicious—malware might use this to test execution policies or create malicious scripts.\n\nWhoami.exe is also present, which usually isn't harmful but can indicate information gathering by attackers trying to identify the current user or system details.\n\nLooking at the events collectively, there are multiple instances of process creation and registry modifications. The combination of powershell.exe activities and whoami.exe could be part of a larger script or payload attempting to gather system info or lateral movement within a network. The file created by PowerShell stands out as it's in a temporary directory, which is a common location for malicious scripts.\n\nWhile each individual event might not raise red flags, the pattern—especially the extensive use of PowerShell and creation of a new script file—could indicate potentially malicious activity. This could be part of an attack chain, such as reconnaissance, credential harvesting, or persistence mechanisms.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because it exhibits behaviors commonly associated with cyberattacks, even though there's no concrete evidence of malicious intent yet. The high number of PowerShell activities and the file creation are points of concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of PowerShell activity, including process accesses, registry modifications, and the creation of a script file in a temporary directory.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The fact that powershell is being used a lot could be concerning because it's often associated with scripting and can be used maliciously. But in this case, some events look benign, like the FileCreate events for .winlogbeat.yml.new.\n\nI notice several Provider Lifecycle tasks from powershell.exe instances. These might just be normal PowerShell operations or script execution attempts. However, the presence of multiple such events could indicate scripting activity, which is common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios.\n\nThere's a File Delete event logged under the rule FileDeleteDetected. That's a red flag because unexpected file deletions can be a sign of tampering or data exfiltration. I need to assess if this deletion is part of normal operations or suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are Process Create events for whoami.exe. While whoami is generally harmless and often used by scripts to check permissions, its use in conjunction with other PowerShell activity might warrant closer inspection.\n\nThe Registry value set events could be setting up persistence mechanisms or modifying system configurations, which is another area that needs attention as it can indicate malicious activities like installing backdoors.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some powershell.exe invocations have complex if-else structures testing for specific file paths. This behavior seems unusual and might be an attempt to check for certain files before proceeding with more malicious actions. Such conditional checks are often part of dropper scripts or malware to avoid detection.\n\nThe high number of events tied to the same user (fiddelis) could indicate that this account is being used for multiple operations, which might not be normal depending on the system's typical usage patterns.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of PowerShell with conditional checks, file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated provider lifecycle tasks—it seems like there's a pattern suggesting potentially malicious activity. While some events might be legitimate, the combination raises enough red flags to merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with conditional checks on file paths and registry modifications, along with a file deletion event, suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're relevant for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that the events are all related to PowerShell and Chrome processes. The initial event shows PowerShell executing a command with some conditional logic checking file paths. This could be normal script execution, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe. These are typical when scripts load modules or assemblies, especially in .NET environments. However, the files loaded include mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are standard for PowerShell, so no immediate red flags here.\n\nThen, there's a FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 followed by a FileDeleteDetected event. This is suspicious because it suggests the script was created and then deleted quickly, possibly to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nAnother file creation is seen for elemento_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder, which might be normal user activity, but paired with previous events, it's worth monitoring.\n\nThe Chrome process shows multiple RegistryEvent tasks. While legitimate applications can modify the registry, repeated writes could indicate potential tampering, especially if they're not standard updates.\n\nAdditionally, there are PipeCreated events from PowerShell, which are often used for inter-process communication. In malicious activities, this might be part of a command and control channel or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple file operations by PowerShell, quick script creation and deletion, registry modifications in Chrome, and pipe creations. These behaviors collectively raise concerns about potential malicious activity, such as scripting to check for files (possibly indicators of persistence), attempting unauthorized access, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nWhile individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests a possible attack vector. The repeated attempts to exit based on file presence could indicate a script trying different paths to execute commands, possibly indicating an attempt to bypass certain security measures or check for specific conditions before proceeding with malicious actions.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs is classified as interesting due to the suspicious sequence of events and potential indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show file creation and deletion patterns indicative of script execution attempts.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, several entries show powershell.exe being used. That's not inherently bad, but the command lines look suspicious. For example, there are multiple instances where New-Item is creating files in different directories, and Set-Content is writing \"dir\" into them. This seems repetitive and could be part of a script trying to create batch files.\n\nLooking at the tasks, I see Registry value sets, Process Create, Process Access, Image loads, and various Provider and Engine Lifecycles. The image loading events are normal for PowerShell running .NET components, so that's not too concerning on its own.\n\nThe command lines in some events show paths like \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..\\\" which seems like an attempt to navigate directories using \"..\". This could be an indicator of trying to access parent directories, possibly to reach system files or other sensitive locations. The repeated use of Set-Content with 'dir' might indicate a script attempting to create batch files that execute directory listings, which is often a precursor to more malicious activities.\n\nThe FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 in the Temp folder stands out. This file name suggests it's related to PowerShell scripting policy testing, which could be part of malicious script execution or testing system configurations for persistence.\n\nConsidering all these together—the repeated use of PowerShell with similar commands, directory manipulation, and creating files that might execute commands—it seems like a red flag. These activities don't appear legitimate and could indicate script-based attacks, possibly attempting to establish persistence or perform reconnaissance.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show suspicious command-line activities involving file creation and manipulation across various directories, which may indicate malicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to analyzing logs, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nFirst, looking at the events provided, they all seem to be related to PowerShell processes and Windows log activities. Each line represents an event with some details about the process, the Windows log task, and any file information.\n\nThe first thing that catches my eye is the high frequency of 'powershell.exe' being executed. I remember that while PowerShell is a legitimate tool for system admins, it's often targeted by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. So multiple instances of powershell.exe running could be suspicious, especially if they're executing scripts.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some events, there are complex script executions. For example, one event shows a command line with a script that checks if a specific file exists and exits accordingly. This kind of behavior can be used by attackers to ensure their malicious script runs only once or after certain conditions are met. That might be an attempt to evade detection.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of files. There's a File Delete task logged, which indicates that something was deleted. The path in this case is 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1'. Temporary files created by scripts often get cleaned up, but the deletion could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove temporary malicious code.\n\nThere are several events where Registry values are being set. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers might install persistence mechanisms or modify system configurations to maintain access. Since multiple registry writes are happening, this raises concerns about potential tampering with system settings.\n\nAlso, the creation of .bat files in various locations is notable. Creating batch scripts can automate tasks, but if these scripts aren't part of legitimate administrative work, they could be executing malicious commands. The paths mentioned seem to be trying to create or test for specific files in different directories, which might indicate an attempt to spread across the system or access restricted areas.\n\nLooking at the image loads from DLLs and other modules, this is typical of how PowerShell scripts load components, but it's something to monitor because attackers can load malicious libraries. The variety of loaded modules could be a sign of more complex activity.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that many events are related to 'Provider Lifecycle'. This usually refers to the activation or deactivation of event providers in Windows. If multiple such events occur, it might indicate some script trying to manipulate logging mechanisms or event subscriptions as part of hiding activities.\n\nConsidering all these points together: numerous PowerShell executions with complex scripts, file deletions and creations, registry modifications, and provider lifecycle changes—it starts to paint a picture of potentially malicious activity. These behaviors are often seen in attacks where adversaries try to establish persistence, execute payloads, and cover their tracks.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the possibility that this could be legitimate administrative activity. System admins might run scripts for various tasks, including checks across different directories or modifying registry settings. But given the number of events and the specific actions taken, especially the use of complex command lines with conditional logic, it leans more towards something suspicious.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about all the specifics, but based on my understanding so far, this batch does show signs that could indicate malicious behavior. I think it's important to look into these events further to determine if they're part of an attack or legitimate activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided log events suggests potential malicious activity due to several red flags:\n\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Execution**: The high occurrence of 'powershell.exe' running could indicate misuse, as attackers often use PowerShell for its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Complex Script Command Lines**: Scripts with conditional logic checking file existence might be part of evasion techniques, ensuring malicious code runs only under specific conditions.\n\n3. **File Deletion and Creation**: Events show temporary files being deleted and .bat files created in various locations. This could be an attempt to remove traces or execute malicious commands.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple registry writes may indicate attempts to alter system configurations for persistence, a common tactic in attacks.\n\n5. **DLL Loadings**: While typical in scripts, the variety of loaded modules could suggest more complex and potentially malicious activity.\n\n6. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: These might signal manipulation of logging mechanisms to hide activities, another red flag in potential attacks.\n\nWhile some actions could be legitimate admin tasks, the combination of behaviors points towards possible malicious intent. Further investigation is recommended to confirm the nature of these events."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be legitimate for admins but it's also commonly used in attacks because it has such powerful scripting capabilities. So any powershell activity might need closer look, especially if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the first event, the command line is checking if a specific .bat file exists and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that. That seems odd. Why would a script check for the existence of another file? Maybe to verify if certain tools are present, but I'm not sure yet. It could be part of legitimate scripting, but it might also indicate something malicious trying to ensure its payload is in place.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell creates and immediately deletes a temporary .ps1 script. That seems suspicious because creating a file just to delete it could be a way to test if the system allows certain operations or to clean up evidence after executing malicious code. The fact that the file was deleted right after creation raises my concern.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple instances of powershell.exe with different command lines, each checking for various .bat files in different paths. This repetition makes me think there's a pattern here—maybe an attempt to check across several directories or maybe trying different ways to execute scripts. It might be part of a larger script that's checking multiple locations for some reason.\n\nThere are also events where powershell is accessing the registry and other processes, which could be normal admin tasks but could also indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. The fact that it's doing multiple registry writes adds to the suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from whoami.exe being executed. While whoami is usually harmless and just shows user info, in this context where powershell is already doing a lot, it might be another step in an attack chain to gather more information or elevate privileges.\n\nOverall, considering all these events together: repeated powershell executions, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, multiple registry accesses, and checks for specific files—it seems like there could be malicious activity. These behaviors don't look like typical user actions and might be part of a script meant to compromise the system. So, I think this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Powershell Activity:** The logs show multiple executions of powershell.exe with different command lines. Powershell is often used maliciously due to its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Command Line Analysis:** Each command line checks for the existence of specific .bat files and exits based on their presence. This behavior could be testing system configurations or ensuring payload tools are in place.\n\n3. **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary .ps1 script is created and deleted immediately, which may indicate an attempt to test file operations or remove evidence after execution.\n\n4. **Repetitive Checks:** The repetition of similar commands across different directories suggests a pattern, possibly indicating a script checking multiple locations for files or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Registry Accesses:** Powershell accessing the registry multiple times could be for legitimate admin tasks but might also signal configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\n6. **whoami.exe Execution:** This could be part of an attack chain to gather user information or elevate privileges, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** The combination of powershell usage, file operations, registry accesses, and whoami execution indicates potential malicious activity requiring further investigation.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch is deemed interesting due to the suspicious nature of the activities detected. The presence of multiple powershell executions, temporary file manipulation, registry accesses, and other indicators suggest possible malicious intent. Therefore, it's important to investigate this batch for potential security threats.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"interesting\": true,\n    \"reasoning\": [\n      \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with varying command lines\",\n      \"Temporary .ps1 file creation followed by deletion\",\n      \"Repetitive checks for specific files across directories\",\n      \"Registry value modifications\",\n      \"Execution of whoami.exe\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers. The command lines in the logs show some tests using If statements checking for specific files' existence, like C:\\registro_ativo\\...\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe.\n\nNext, I see several ImageLoad events related to .NET libraries and Windows Defender components. This is normal because PowerShell relies on these frameworks. However, it's worth noting to ensure there are no anomalies here.\n\nThere are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events for a temporary PowerShell script file. The creation and deletion of such scripts could indicate script execution or testing, which might be suspicious if not related to legitimate activities.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This location is typically used by PowerShell for profile data but could be a vector for persistence if modified improperly.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe running suggests user information gathering, which could be part of reconnaissance or more malicious activity. Additionally, the cmd.exe command checks for a text file's existence and exits based on that. Simple checks like this might be part of a larger script to determine system configuration before executing further commands.\n\nRegistry value sets in the logs indicate potential persistence mechanisms or changes to system configurations, which can be concerning if they alter security settings.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple process creations, file operations, registry modifications, and use of command-line tools like cmd.exe. These activities could be part of a legitimate script or administrative task but also align with early indicators of malicious behavior such as testing for file existence (possibly to drop payloads later), using temporary files, and attempting persistence.\n\nWhile individual events might not raise flags, the combination suggests potential investigation is warranted.

The tasks listed include \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set,\" which might indicate attempts to modify system configurations or access sensitive areas—possible signs of unauthorized activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are several `whoami.exe` processes being created. While `whoami` is generally used to determine user information, its execution in certain contexts could be part of privilege escalation techniques or reconnaissance. The command lines don't seem suspicious at first glance, but the frequency might warrant closer inspection.\n\nA significant number of events show PowerShell accessing various image files and DLLs, which is normal for script execution. However, the combination with other actions like registry modifications could hint at a more complex operation, possibly scripting-based attacks.\n\nLastly, there are multiple `Provider Lifecycle` tasks from PowerShell. This category can be related to service management or driver injection, which might be used in persistence mechanisms or to hide malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated use of PowerShell with varied tasks and the creation of other utilities like `whoami.exe`—it seems that this batch could indicate potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing some system event. The user mentioned that these are from analyzing system logs for malicious behavior, and they want a single classification for the entire batch.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few events show powershell.exe being involved in various tasks: loading images (like MpOAV.dll), creating files in temporary folders, deleting those files, and accessing registry values. These are common activities for PowerShell scripts, especially ones that might be testing or checking file existence. I remember that many legitimate scripts use PowerShell to interact with the system, so these actions alone don't necessarily indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there's an event where whoami.exe is executed. That's a standard command used to get user information, often benign and not suspicious unless it's part of a larger attack chain. But in this context, it's just one instance, so I'm not too concerned.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell command lines, they all seem to be checking if specific files exist using Test-Path. The paths mentioned vary but follow a pattern with \"tarefa_base\", \"elemento_base.cs\", and other terms that don't immediately flag as malicious. These could be part of build processes or deployment scripts trying to verify file presence before proceeding.\n\nI also notice multiple events where the same file checks are made, which might suggest some retry logic or redundant checks in a script. This repetition isn't unusual for certain types of automated tasks but doesn't raise red flags for me.\n\nThe fact that files are being created and then deleted (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1) could be part of testing whether scripts are allowed to run or not. However, without seeing the content of these files, it's hard to say if they're malicious. But in this case, since it's just creating and deleting temporary files associated with PowerShell scripts, it doesn't look suspicious on its own.\n\nThe registry access events are another point to consider. Malware often modifies the registry for persistence or configuration, but again, legitimate software can do that too. The event here shows a 'Registry value set', which could be part of a script setting some parameters without any nefarious intent.\n\nAnother thing is that all these activities seem isolated and don't show signs of lateral movement or multiple stages typical in an attack. There's no network communication mentioned, no unusual file creation outside the temporary folders, and no privilege escalation attempts noted in the logs provided.\n\nAlso, considering the command lines, they're all using standard PowerShell commands without any obfuscation or encoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious code. If anything, the straightforward use of Test-Path suggests this is part of a legitimate check rather than an attempt to hide something.\n\nI should also think about whether these activities could be part of a known benign process. For example, during software installations, scripts often run checks on various files and registry entries to ensure prerequisites are met or to configure settings. Temporary script creation is normal in such contexts.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances performing file checks, some temporary file operations, registry modifications—without additional context indicating malicious behavior, these events don't seem suspicious. They could easily be part of a legitimate process, like during software setup or automated testing.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events does not indicate any malicious activity. Here's the classification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"not_malicious\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The activities observed in the logs are consistent with benign actions performed by PowerShell scripts, such as file existence checks, temporary file creation and deletion, and registry modifications. These actions do not exhibit any characteristics of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The winlog key seems to indicate different tasks or rules triggered, like ProcessAccess, ImageLoad, FileCreate, etc.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- They involve powershell.exe accessing various files and processes.\n- There are multiple ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These seem like normal .NET framework components that PowerShell would load.\n- Then there's a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. This script is created and then immediately deleted, which might be suspicious.\n\nContinuing through the logs:\n- There are several Engine Lifecycle events when running specific PowerShell commands. The command lines check if certain PS1 files exist in different paths.\n- Another FileCreate event from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file, which seems benign as it's likely part of data collection.\n- Registry value sets by both powershell.exe and notepad.exe. Powershell often interacts with the registry, but unusual activity here could be a red flag.\n\nI also see other processes:\n- whoami.exe running without any issues, just creating a process.\n- svchost.exe modifying the registry, which is common for system services but can also be used maliciously if it's part of a service change.\n- calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which seems normal as URLMON is part of Windows.\n\nPutting this all together:\nThe repeated checks for specific PowerShell scripts in different directories might indicate reconnaissance or an attempt to ensure certain files exist before proceeding with something else. The creation and deletion of the temporary script file could be a sign of malicious activity trying to avoid detection by not leaving a trace, though it's also possible it's part of a legitimate process like testing permissions.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe with specific command lines to check for file existence is concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for its scripting capabilities and to evade detection. The combination of registry access, image loading, and file operations could be part of setting up or executing malicious commands.\n\nI'm also noting the multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components, which are standard for PowerShell but in some cases might indicate code injection or loading malicious libraries if unusual DLLs were involved. However, in this case, it's standard.\n\nIn summary, while there isn't a single event that's definitively malicious, the pattern of activity—especially around file checks and temporary script creation—raises flags. It could be part of an attack chain looking for system information or attempting to execute code discreetly.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits behavior that raises concern due to potential indicators of suspicious activity:\n\n- **File Creation and Deletion**: The creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) suggests an attempt to avoid detection, which is often seen in malicious activities.\n\n- **Registry Interactions**: Multiple registry value sets by `powershell.exe` could indicate configuration changes that might be part of a broader attack strategy, such as persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\n- **Repeated File Checks**: The PowerShell commands checking for the existence of specific script files in various directories may be probing the system's configuration or attempting to locate sensitive information.\n\nWhile no single event is conclusive evidence of malicious activity, the combination of these behaviors points to potential hostile intent. Further investigation would be warranted to assess the nature and impact of these activities on the system's security.\n\n**Final Assessment**: The log events are considered **interesting for investigation**, particularly focusing on the file operations involving `powershell.exe` and the temporary script creation\/deletion."}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an event where `winlogbeat.exe` created a file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. That seems like it could be related to the log forwarding configuration, so maybe normal behavior.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from `powershell.exe`, which catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The events show that PowerShell accessed processes and made changes to registry values. Those actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious, but they could indicate command execution or persistence mechanisms if the commands are complex or unusual.\n\nThere's also a `whoami.exe` process being created, which is typically harmless as it's used to get user information. However, in some cases, it might be part of a larger attack chain to check permissions or user context.\n\nI notice a lot of network connection events from both `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe`. While Chrome making connections is normal for browsing, repeated connections could be indicative of malicious activity like C2 communication. The DNS queries from Chrome don't raise immediate flags but combined with other activities might warrant closer look.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events more closely, there's a command line that includes `& {ls -recurse}` and `get-childitem -recurse`. These commands list files recursively, which could be part of data gathering or reconnaissance. The fact that this is executed via PowerShell suggests potential script execution, which might be malicious if not authorized.\n\nAdditionally, the registry value being set by PowerShell could be a sign of persistence mechanisms, where attackers store configurations or scripts to run at system startup. This combined with image loading events for various DLLs in known .NET frameworks and Windows Defender components seems normal but might mask malicious activity if the paths aren't fully trusted.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and registry, combined with network connections from Chrome and svchost.exe, along with file creation by winlogbeat, and script execution commands in PowerShell. These could be indicators of potential malicious behavior or at least suspicious activities that merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, along with network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system logs to analyze. Let me go through each event and see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe. That's interesting because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first few entries show that a file was created and then deleted by powershell.exe. The file path looks temporary: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. Temporary files created and deleted quickly could be part of script execution, maybe to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe runs a command line that includes multiple cmdlets like ls, get-childitem, and gci with the -recurse parameter. Repeated use of these commands might indicate data gathering activities—perhaps enumerating directories or files recursively across the system. This could be part of reconnaissance to gather information about the environment.\n\nAnother point is that powershell.exe accessed a file in ProgramData related to Windows Defender. That's a bit concerning because accessing such protected areas can be an indicator of malicious behavior, though it could also be legitimate for antivirus operations.\n\nThere are also events where winlogbeat.exe creates files, which makes sense if the system is running the ELK stack or similar logging tools. However, one of these events is creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file; not sure if that's standard or might indicate configuration changes.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity in the Registry with both powershell.exe and conhost.exe setting registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware to maintain access across reboots. The fact that multiple processes are doing this adds some concern.\n\nFinally, a file called estrutura_secundario.txt was created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. This could be part of data exfiltration if it's transferring sensitive information, but without knowing its content, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running scripts with file and registry manipulations, temporary files being deleted quickly, and potential data gathering activities. These behaviors collectively point towards possible malicious activity, especially given the combination of events that could be part of a cyberattack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances show file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated commands indicative of reconnaissance or data gathering. Temporary files may indicate script execution, while Registry changes raise concern for persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
