Each event is a JSON object and they all seem to be similar. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which makes me think that Git is being used here. The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp. The filenames vary but end with .d.ts, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are usually generated by tools like TypeScript to provide type information for JavaScript modules.\n\nThe pattern here is consistent across all events. Each event involves the creation of a different file in the same directory, all related to Lodash's functional programming utilities (hence 'fp' in the path). Since they're node_modules and types, this likely pertains to a development environment where someone is working on a project that uses Node.js and TypeScript.\n\nNow, considering the context, I don't immediately see any signs of malicious activity. The process is Git, which is a common tool used by developers for version control. The creation of these files could be part of a normal build or install process when setting up dependencies in a project. For example, when running `npm install` or `yarn add`, sometimes TypeScript compiler might generate these .d.ts files as part of the setup.\n\nI should also consider whether multiple file creations in quick succession is unusual. In a development environment, especially with tools like Git and Node.js, it's not uncommon for several files to be created or modified during operations like cloning a repository, installing packages, or running build scripts.\n\nAnother angle is checking if \"git.exe\" is typically used on this system. If the user in question is a developer, then seeing Git-related events is normal. However, if this system isn't supposed to be handling development work, it might raise flags, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nLooking at each file path, they all follow a predictable naming convention related to Lodash functions. This suggests that these are legitimate files part of the Cypress types package for Lodash. There's nothing in the filenames that hints at malicious intent—no suspicious extensions or random characters typical of malware.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of log injection or spoofing, but since all events have consistent structures and come from the same process, it seems less likely they're fabricated. The uniformity in the data supports the idea that this is a genuine activity rather than an attack.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no evidence of unusual behavior here.
