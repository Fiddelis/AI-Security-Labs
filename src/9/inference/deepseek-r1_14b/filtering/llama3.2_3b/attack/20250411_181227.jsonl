Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that create scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which suggests someone is setting up persistent tasks on the system. These tasks execute calc.exe at logon, which is unusual because calc isn't typically used maliciously, but it's a common way to hide malicious activity.\n\nThe process names match powershell.exe with specific command lines that vary slightly in naming (like 'unidade_ativo', 'entrada_temporario'). This repetition could indicate an attacker creating multiple tasks to bypass detection or ensure persistence. The use of BUILTIN\\Administrators group and RunLevel Highest means these tasks have high privileges, which is a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are events where files are created and then deleted in the Temp directory related to PSScriptPolicyTest. This might be an attempt to test script execution policies or delete evidence after checking if scripts can run, another sign of potential malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a series of events with 'Execute a Remote Command' under winlog, but no process or file details. These could be indicators of remote control or command execution attempts, possibly from an attacker trying to access the system remotely.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry modifications and image loads related to powershell.exe, which is normal for script execution, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it raises suspicion about configuration changes that might be part of a larger attack.\n\nTaking all these into account: repeated creation of high-privilege scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action, file operations in Temp, and remote command attempts. These patterns are consistent with tactics used in cyberattacks for persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The combination suggests a potential security incident that requires closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple events show `powershell.exe` being executed with command lines creating scheduled tasks.\n\n2. **Analyze Scheduled Task Commands:**\n   - These commands use `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`, targeting the `BUILTIN\\Administrators` group with high privileges.\n   - The tasks execute `calc.exe` at logon, which is unusual and potentially malicious.\n\n3. **Look for File Operations:**\n   - A file is created in the Temp directory related to script policy testing but then deleted, possibly indicating an attempt to bypass detection or remove evidence.\n\n4. **Check for Remote Command Execution:**\n   - Events indicate attempts to execute remote commands without associated processes or files, suggesting potential unauthorized access.\n\n5. **Consider Privilege Escalation:**\n   - High-privilege tasks and file operations in sensitive areas (like Temp) may be part of an attack chain aiming for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Combine Indicators:**\n   - The repetition of creating high-privilege tasks, coupled with file deletions and remote command attempts, suggests a coordinated attack rather than isolated incidents.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThese events indicate potential malicious activity, including privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms, requiring immediate investigation to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are two events from svchost.exe: one where a registry value was set and another where a file was created in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. SvcHost is a common process name for services, so it's not unusual to see it in logs, but certain actions might be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are two events indicating \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no associated files or processes. This could be concerning because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like command-line attacks or reverse shells.\n\nThen, PowerShell is involved in creating a file under the user's AppData folder. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting, it's also frequently abused by attackers. The path mentioned seems normal for PowerShell profile data, but I should keep an eye out for any unusual commands or persistence mechanisms here.\n\nThere are several entries from chrome.exe regarding image loading and registry changes. Chrome often loads various DLLs and interacts with the registry, so these might be standard activities unless they involve unexpected files or repeated attempts to set registry values beyond normal usage.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory doesn't raise any red flags on its own; it's likely related to log shipping or monitoring.\n\nPutting this all together: The remote command executions stand out as potential signs of malicious activity. Even though individual events might not be suspicious, the combination—especially multiple remote commands and use of svchost.exe with file creation in non-standard locations—could indicate a compromise. However, without more context or severity indicators, it's hard to say for sure. I'm leaning towards this being interesting but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, such as remote command execution and unusual file creation by svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
