{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all JSONL format, each line a separate event. The main areas here seem to be process activity, Windows log tasks, and file interactions. \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- \"SDXHelper.exe\" loaded \"combase.dll\". That seems normal since combase is a system file.\n- \"svchost.exe\" setting a registry value. Svchost is commonly used by services, so this might be standard unless it's paired with something suspicious.\n- Excel.exe loading various DLLs like combase, mscoree, etc. These are legitimate files that Excel would need to run.\n\nThere are multiple events where \"Excel.exe\" loads these system files and creates a file in the user's Recent folder. Creating files is normal for an application trying to save work. The repeated creation of the same file might just be Excel saving frequently or being used by someone who saves often.\n\nThen, there's a logon event and some User Account Management entries, which are typical during user activity, especially if someone logs in or their account info changes.\n\nThe last few events show Excel making DNS queries. While this is normal for applications needing to connect online, without context on what the query was for, it's hard to say. If it were something malicious, there might be more indicators like unusual domains or repeated attempts.\n\nConsidering all these points, each individual event doesn't seem out of place. The repetition in Excel events could just be regular usage rather than malicious activity. There's no evidence of failed logins, access to restricted files, or other red flags that would raise concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as loading legitimate DLLs, user account management events, and Excel operations which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
