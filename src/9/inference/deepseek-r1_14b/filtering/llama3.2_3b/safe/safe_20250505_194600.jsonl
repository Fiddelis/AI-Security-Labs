{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_194600.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory with a .new extension. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely updating or backing up its configuration.\n\nNext, notepad.exe creates a file named arquivo.txt. Notepad doing this is standard user activityâ€”opening or saving files. No red flags here.\n\nThe third and fourth events are duplicates of the first one. Again, same process creating the same file, which might be part of a script or automated process updating configuration files.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe launching shell32.dll for some system-related task. Rundll32 is often used by legitimate processes, but I should check if this specific command is known as malicious. It references a GUID and Embedding, which sounds like it's starting a DLL in a specific way. But without more context, it might be part of Windows' normal operations.\n\nLastly, notepad.exe runs again with the same file path. This seems consistent with user activity, maybe editing the same document multiple times.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together, all events seem to involve legitimate processes doing what they're supposed to do. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, failed attempts, or anomalies that would suggest malicious activity. Each event is isolated and doesn't show signs of being part of a larger suspicious pattern.\n\nI'm not seeing any high-risk indicators like multiple failed logins, unauthorized file accesses, or process creations from unknown sources. The confidence level here is low because there's nothing out of the ordinary in the logs.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activities such as creating and opening files using Notepad.exe and legitimate system processes like winlogbeat.exe and rundll32.exe. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.1\n}\n```"}
