{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where schtasks.exe is being used with command lines that create scheduled tasks. Specifically, I notice commands like \"\/create\" and \"\/query\", which suggest someone is setting up or querying scheduled tasks. The command lines also include references to powershell.exe with some parameters like \"-ep bypass,\" which caught my attention because bypassing execution policies is a common tactic in malicious scripts.\n\nThen there's the repeated use of svchost.exe modifying registry values. While svchost.exe is legitimate, unusual activity or multiple changes could indicate something suspicious, especially when combined with other events.\n\nThe powershell.exe processes are accessing and creating files, some of which have non-existent file paths mentioned in their command lines (like c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1). This might be an attempt to execute malicious scripts that aren't actually present on the system, a possible red flag for scripting or fileless malware.\n\nThere's also a lot of registry activity from various processes, particularly chrome.exe and svchost.exe.频繁的注册表操作，尤其是来自不同进程的，可能表明有恶意软件在尝试持久化或进行其他恶意活动。\n\nAdditionally, whoami.exe is being executed without any arguments, which could be part of lateral movement or reconnaissance within a compromised system.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of schtasks to create scheduled tasks with potentially malicious scripts, coupled with powershell and svchost registry modifications, suggests possible command and control activities or persistence mechanisms. The non-existing script paths in the command lines add more suspicion as attackers often use such techniques to avoid detection.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of schtasks.exe creating scheduled tasks with powershell.exe commands, potential registry modifications by svchost.exe, and other activities indicative of malicious behavior. The repeated creation and querying of tasks, along with the use of suspicious command-line parameters like '-ep bypass', raise concerns about potential scripting or fileless malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
