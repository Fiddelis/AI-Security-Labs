The events are in JSONL format, with each line being a JSON object containing process info, Windows log task details, and file info.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used maliciously for executing scripts or commands. In several events, the command lines are similar; they're taking screenshots using System.Windows.Forms and saving them to different files in %TEMP%. This activity seems suspicious because it's capturing screen shots without user interaction, which could indicate data exfiltration or surveillance.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there are 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded' events. The registry access might be part of persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations. The image loads seem normal for PowerShell executing .NET libraries, but combined with other activities, it raises concerns.\n\nOne event stands out where the command line is lengthy and includes specific file paths in %TEMP%. This repeated pattern of saving images suggests a script running multiple times, possibly attempting to gather visual data over time or across different sessions. The use of 'Add-Type' indicates dynamic code injection, which can be used for malicious purposes.\n\nThe presence of svchost.exe accessing the registry is another point to consider. While svchost is a legitimate process, unexpected registry activity might hint at tampering or installation of backdoors.\n\nIn summary, multiple PowerShell instances performing screen captures, combined with registry modifications and image loading, indicate potential malicious behavior. This batch shows signs of unauthorized data collection and system configuration changes, which are hallmark indicators of cyberattack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe instances capturing screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as screen recording or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events involve PowerShell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The first two events show FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected related to a .ps1 file in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because attackers often use scripts to perform malicious activities, which they might delete afterward to cover their tracks.\n\nLooking at the command line in some of these PowerShell events, I see that it's executing code to capture the screen into an image and save it to the TEMP folder. This could be part of a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration. It's definitely something worth looking into because taking screenshots without user interaction might indicate unauthorized access.\n\nThere are also multiple events where Registry values are being set, both by PowerShell.exe and other processes like conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of installing backdoors or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\nI see some events from winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. That's probably normal for log shipping tools unless it's showing unexpected behavior, which isn't evident here.\n\nThe Calculator.exe and Chrome.exe entries setting Registry values might seem innocuous, but sometimes legitimate processes can be used as part of a larger attack chain. The repeated Registry writes from Chrome could be normal, but I should consider the contextâ€”like if they're out of the ordinary for typical usage patterns.\n\nThere's also an event where Chrome is loading AMSI.DLL, which is related to antivirus scanning. This might indicate attempts to bypass security measures or test them.\n\nPutting it all together, the recurring PowerShell activity with file creation\/deletion and Registry modifications stands out as concerning. The screen capture script in particular raises red flags for malicious behavior. While some events are normal, the combination of these indicators suggests potential attack activities. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes show file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and suspicious script execution. These activities indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
