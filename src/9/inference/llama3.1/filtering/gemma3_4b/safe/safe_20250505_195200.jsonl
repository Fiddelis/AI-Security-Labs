The similarity in file names suggests that these may be identical or very similar files being created.\n\nThe command to find the hash of each file is:\n\n`sha256sum *`\n\nHowever, since we only want to see if any files with different hashes exist, it's more efficient to use `find` with a hash comparison:\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \\; | sort | uniq -d\n```\n\nThis will print out the filenames and hashes of duplicate files.\n\nTo find identical files (i.e., files with exactly the same contents), you can compare their hashes. If there are any lines where both columns contain the same hash, it means that those files have identical contents:\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \\; | sort > files.sha256\n\n# Now run the following command to find duplicate hashes (i.e., identical files)\nawk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS=\" \"}NR==FNR{a[$0];next}($0 in a){print \"Identical file(s):\"$0}' files.sha256 -\n```\n\nPlease note that you need to be careful when running this command, as it may take some time and resources to process the data.\n\nAlso, since the problem description doesn't provide any information on how many duplicates exist or what kind of actions are desired based on these results, I'll assume you want to remove all duplicate files. If so, use the following approach:\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -print0 | sort -z | uniq -d -z | xargs -0 rm\n```\n\nThis will delete all files with identical contents (i.e., the same hash)."}
