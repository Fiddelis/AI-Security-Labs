Each log entry contains information about a specific event that occurred on the system.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the fields present in each log entry:\n\n1. `process`: This field indicates the process name related to the event. If it's empty or null, it means there is no specific process associated with the event.\n2. `winlog`: This field contains information about the Windows-specific event that occurred. It includes:\n\t* `task`: The type of task that triggered the event (e.g., \"Process Create,\" \"Image loaded,\" etc.)\n\t* `rule`: The rule or filter that triggered the event (e.g., \"ProcessCreate,\" \"ImageLoad,\" etc.)\n3. `file`: This field contains information about any file-related events, such as:\n\t* `path`: The full path of the file involved in the event\n\nLooking at the log entries:\n\n* There are multiple instances where a process named `chrome.exe` is associated with registry value set events.\n* A process named `taskhostw.exe` loaded an image from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll`.\n* Another process, `SDXHelper.exe`, loaded images from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\combase.dll` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll`.\n* There's a log entry for a new file being created in the WinLogBeat installation directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) by the `winlogbeat.exe` process.\n* Several instances of \"User Account Management\" events are logged, likely due to user login or logout activities.\n\nThese logs can provide valuable insights into system activity and potential security concerns."}
