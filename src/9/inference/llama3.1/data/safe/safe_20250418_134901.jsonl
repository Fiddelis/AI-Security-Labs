{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"The data appears to be a log of Windows events, collected by the Winlogbeat tool. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n**Event types**\n\nThere are several event types represented in the data:\n\n* `File created`: A file was created on the system.\n* `Image loaded`: An executable file was loaded into memory.\n* `Registry value set`: A registry value was modified.\n* `Dns query`: A DNS query was sent to a server.\n\n**Processes**\n\nSeveral processes are mentioned in the data, including:\n\n* `winlogbeat.exe`\n* `sppsvc.exe`\n* `svchost.exe`\n* `notepad.exe`\n* `chrome.exe`\n* `smartscreen.exe`\n* `taskhostw.exe`\n\nThese processes are likely running on the system at some point during the logging period.\n\n**Files**\n\nSeveral files are mentioned in the data, including:\n\n* `.winlogbeat.yml.new` (created by Winlogbeat)\n* `urlmon.dll` (loaded into memory by various processes)\n* `taskschd.dll` (loaded into memory by various processes)\n\nThese files may be relevant to understanding the system's behavior and interactions.\n\n**Other notes**\n\n* The data includes some repetitive events, such as multiple instances of `chrome.exe` setting registry values.\n* There are some missing or incomplete event fields, which may indicate issues with Winlogbeat configuration or data collection.\n\nOverall, this data suggests that a variety of processes are running on the system, interacting with files and registry settings. Further analysis would be required to understand the specific behavior and potential security implications."}
