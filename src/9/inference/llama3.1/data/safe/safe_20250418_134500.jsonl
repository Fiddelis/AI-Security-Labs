{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) in JSON format. It appears to be a collection of Windows event logs collected by Winlogbeat, which is a Beats module for collecting Windows event logs.\n\nHere's a brief summary of what I've extracted from this log:\n\n**Top Events:**\n\n1. File creation events (e.g., `File created (rule: FileCreate)`)\n2. Process creation events (e.g., `Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)`)\n3. Registry value set events (e.g., `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`)\n\n**Notable Processes:**\n\n1. `winlogbeat.exe`: The Winlogbeat process itself\n2. `svchost.exe`: A Windows system service host process\n3. `Explorer.EXE`: The Windows Explorer process\n4. `notepad.exe`: The Notepad application\n5. `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`: An Edge browser update process\n6. `CompatTelRunner.exe`: A compatibility tool runner process\n7. `setup.exe`: An installation package setup process\n\n**Notable Files:**\n\n1. `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl`: A Windows Update log file\n2. `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download\\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}\\135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`: An Edge browser update file\n3. `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`: A temporary Edge browser update file\n\n**Other Observations:**\n\n* There are several events related to Edge browser updates, suggesting that the system is running an update.\n* The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process appears to be querying DNS (e.g., \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\").\n* The `setup.exe` process is creating a pipe (e.g., \"Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\").\n\nThis log provides a snapshot of system activity, including events related to file creation, process creation, and registry value changes. It can be used for security monitoring, troubleshooting, or other purposes where event logs are relevant."}
