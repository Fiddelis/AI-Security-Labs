{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' setting registry values, combined with a PowerShell process creating files and 'winlogbeat.exe' modifying configuration files, suggest potential malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repetitive Registry Modifications by Chrome**: \n   - The batch contains numerous entries where `chrome.exe` is setting registry values. While legitimate processes can modify the registry, an unusually high number of such events could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or make system-wide changes.\n\n2. **Image Load Events**:\n   - `chrome.exe` loading system DLLs (`amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) is typically benign but noteworthy in conjunction with other suspicious activities as it might be used for privilege escalation or evasion techniques.\n\n3. **File Creation by PowerShell and Winlogbeat**:\n   - The use of `powershell.exe` to create a file (`componente_secundario.txt`) can be indicative of script execution, which is often associated with malware.\n   - Similarly, modifications by `winlogbeat.exe` suggest changes in system logging or monitoring configurations that might be leveraged to obscure malicious activities.\n\nOverall, the combination of these events—particularly the persistent registry modifications and file creations by processes like PowerShell and Winlogbeat—raises suspicion about potential unauthorized or malicious activity on the system."}
