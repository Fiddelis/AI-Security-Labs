The referenced scripts (e.g., c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1) do not exist, which might suggest either a probing attempt or an error by the attacker. Additionally, 'svchost.exe' is repeatedly involved in setting registry values and creating tasks, which could be indicative of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms being set up.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
