Multiple accesses could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or commands without user knowledge.\n  \n- **Whoami.exe**: This utility is often used to check the current user's privileges. Its execution with command-line specification (though typically benign) in logs can raise suspicion if combined with other potentially malicious activities, such as powershell access.\n\n- **Other Processes**: While activities related to `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`, and `chrome.exe` are mostly benign and could be part of regular user activity, the combination of these events alongside suspicious ones warrants investigation.\n\nOverall, while many processes appear typical, the presence of specific events involving powershell and whoami suggest potential malicious behavior or reconnaissance activities."}
