The use of 'cmd.exe' and 'tasklist.exe' for system introspection and monitoring (like task creation and listing) might indicate potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts. Additionally, the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe', which is used for log shipping, could be benign but may also be indicative of exfiltration if logs are being forwarded to unauthorized destinations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
