The use of 'powershell.exe' to execute a series of commands that gather user and group information (e.g., net user, get-localuser) is suspicious. Additionally, the creation of files such as 'elemento_logico.txt' and modifications using PowerShell suggest possible lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts. Frequent access and manipulation of security-related logs, along with multiple instances of registry value sets and process creations, further indicate potential unauthorized activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
