Notably, the repeated use of `certutil.exe` to encode and decode files suggests an attempt at obfuscation or data exfiltration. Additionally, the execution of `rundll32.exe` with a custom DLL (`PcaSvc.dll`) is suspicious as it could be used for executing arbitrary code. The presence of `SDXHelper.exe` loading system library images (`combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) is unusual and potentially malicious, indicating attempts to hook or modify standard library operations. These activities combined warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
