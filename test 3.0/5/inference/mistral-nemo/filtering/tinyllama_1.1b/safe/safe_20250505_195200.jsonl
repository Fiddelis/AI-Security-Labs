These newly created files are located in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n4.

This could be a normal behavior if the application is designed to keep these files updated, or it might indicate an issue if the creation of these files is causing unexpected system resource usage.\n\nTo further investigate, you may want to:\n\n- Check what application or service is triggering this event.\n- Ensure that the creation of these files is necessary and not causing any performance issues on your system.\n- Consider monitoring these events over time to understand their purpose and frequency better."}
