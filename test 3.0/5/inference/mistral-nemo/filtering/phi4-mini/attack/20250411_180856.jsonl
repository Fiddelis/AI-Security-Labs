First, there are several consecutive network connection detected events triggered by chrome.exe which could indicate data exfiltration. Secondly, a WMIC process created another process named notepad.exe with an empty command line argument. This could potentially be a part of a living-off-the-land (LOTL) attack where legitimate tools are used for malicious purposes. Lastly, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe being accessed and winlogbeat.exe creating files which could indicate attempts at privilege escalation or data theft.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
