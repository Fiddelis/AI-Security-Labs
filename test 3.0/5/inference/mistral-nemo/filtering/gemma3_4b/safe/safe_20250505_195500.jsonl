These files are being created in the following directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n   - This process seems to be creating or updating files related to the Microsoft Office \"Office JavaScript Libraries\" solution package. The `<hash>` in the file names likely represents unique versions of these libraries.\n\n2. **Registry Value Set Event (chrome.exe)**:\n   - The `chrome.exe` process set a registry value, but no details about the specific value or its location are provided. This could be due to Chrome itself making changes to its configuration, extensions, or preferences.\n\nHere's what you might want to investigate further:\n\n- **Check if these files and events are expected**: Microsoft Office updates often involve changes to solution packages like this one. You may want to confirm if these file creations and registry changes are part of expected software updates.\n- **Monitor for any unexpected behavior**: Keep an eye out for any unusual system or application behavior after these events, such as crashes, performance issues, or unauthorized changes.\n- **Review the content of the created files (if possible)**: If the file contents are accessible (and assuming they're safe to open), you could review them to understand what's being updated. However, it might be challenging due to their hashed names and minified format.\n- **Check for related events**: Look for any other related events or logs around the same time as these file creations and registry change to gain more context about what's happening."}
