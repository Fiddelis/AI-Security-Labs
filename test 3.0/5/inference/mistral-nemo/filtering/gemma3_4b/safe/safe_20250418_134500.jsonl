{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows Event Logs, here's a summary of the activities:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Service (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe)**\n   - The service started and loaded its executable and DLL files.\n   - It accessed other processes and network connections were detected.\n   - It terminated multiple times (three instances), which could indicate abnormal behavior or frequent restarts.\n   - This activity might be related to Microsoft Edge browser updates.\n\n2. **Runtime Broker**\n   - RuntimeBroker.exe set a registry value. This is likely normal behavior as Runtime Broker handles tasks like managing DPI awareness for high-DPI displays and managing window placement for modern apps.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Service (winlogbeat.exe)**\n   - Winlogbeat, a log shipping agent by Elastic, was started manually from the Downloads folder.\n   - It loaded its executable, created a new NDJSON log file (winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson), and likely began collecting and forwarding logs. This activity is normal if you've intentionally set up Winlogbeat for log management.\n\nHere are some potential concerns or questions to consider:\n\n- Why did MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe terminate multiple times? You might want to check for any related error messages or investigate if it's causing system instability.\n- Since winlogbeat.exe was started manually from the Downloads folder, you may want to consider moving it to a more appropriate location (e.g., Program Files) and setting it up to run as a service for better management and stability."}
