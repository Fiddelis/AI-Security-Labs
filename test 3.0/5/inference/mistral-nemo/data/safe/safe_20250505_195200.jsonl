You can do this by searching for it in your Task Manager or using a tool like Process Explorer from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite.\n\n2. **Check the file location and content:**\n   - Verify if the files are actually being created at the specified location (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Support\\OfflineFiles\\) and whether they are duplicates or have different content.\n   - Check if these files are necessary for any ongoing process or application on your system.\n\n3. **Update or reinstall problematic software:** If SDXHelper.exe is associated with a specific application (like Microsoft Office), try updating that software to the latest version, or even consider reinstalling it if updates don't resolve the issue.\n\n4. **Monitor running processes:** Keep an eye on other processes running concurrently with SDXHelper.exe. They might be interfering with its operation and causing these duplicate file creation events.\n\n5. **Check for malware:** Run a full system scan using reliable antivirus\/anti-malware software to ensure no malicious programs are causing this behavior.\n\n6. **Contact software vendor\/support:** If the issue persists, reach out to Microsoft Support (if SDXHelper.exe is related to their products) or the software's vendor to get further assistance and guidance tailored to their product(s)."}

Here are a few observations:\n\n1. **Multiple File Creations**: The same file is being created multiple times, which suggests that something might be stuck in a loop or not closing properly.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe Process**: This process seems to be associated with the file creation. It might be worth looking into what this process does and why it's creating these files repeatedly.\n\n3. **Folder Path**: The files are being created in the following folder: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`. You might want to check if there's anything unusual happening in this folder or its parent folders.\n\nHere are some steps you could take:\n\n- Check the task manager to see if SDXHelper.exe is using an unusually high amount of CPU or memory.\n- Look for any error messages or warnings associated with these file creation events.\n- Try renaming or moving the folder where these files are being created to see if that stops the issue. If it does, you can then safely delete the problematic files.\n- Consider reaching out to Microsoft support (if the process is related to Office) or the software developer for further assistance.\n\nUntil we know more about what SDXHelper.exe does and why it's creating these files repeatedly, it's hard to provide a definitive solution.

This could indicate one of two possibilities:\n\n1. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**: The process `SDXHelper.exe` might be generating temporary JavaScript files for its operations and then deleting them afterwards. This is normal behavior if the files are only meant to be used temporarily.\n\n2. **Error or Issue with File Handling**: If these files are not supposed to be created and deleted in this manner, it could indicate an error or issue with how `SDXHelper.exe` is handling files. It might be experiencing problems like insufficient permissions to delete files, file locking by another process, or a bug causing it to repeatedly attempt creation and deletion.\n\nTo diagnose the issue further:\n- Check if any other processes are using or locking these files.\n- Verify if `SDXHelper.exe` has sufficient permissions to create, read, write, and delete files in the specified directory.\n- Monitor the system for any error messages or warnings related to file handling by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n- If this behavior is causing issues (e.g., performance problems due to excessive I\/O operations), consider reaching out to Microsoft Support or the software vendor for further assistance."}

Here are some observations and suggestions:\n\n1. **Repeated File Creation**: The same files are being created repeatedly, suggesting a possible error or infinite loop in the script or application responsible for this action.\n\n2. **File Naming Convention**: All the files follow a naming convention with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a unique hash or version number (e.g., `309b467d`, `ad7fe0bc`, etc.). This indicates that these are likely minified JavaScript files.\n\n3. **Process Involved**: The process creating these files is \"SDXHelper.exe\", which seems to be related to Microsoft Office's software development kit (SDK) for developers.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you might want to:\n\n- Check if there's an error or infinite loop in your scripts or applications that are interacting with SDXHelper.\n- Ensure that the application or script is properly handling file creation and disposal to prevent such repeated creations.\n- Consider reaching out to Microsoft Support if the issue persists after checking your own codebase, as it could be a bug in their software.\n\nHere's an example of how these logs might look in a formatted way for easier tracking:\n\n| Timestamp | Process Name | Task       | File Path                                                                                                |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| ... | SDXHelper.exe | File created | C:\\Users\\Fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf660747b40d35eebf842937b\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_309b467d |\n| ... | SDXHelper.exe | File created | C:\\Users\\Fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf660747b40d35eebf842937b\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_ad7fe0bc |\n| ... | SDXHelper.exe | File created | C:\\Users\\Fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf660747b40d35eebf842937b\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_b0595a61 |"}

If so, that application or service might be the cause of these files being created.\n2. Monitor the process creating these files using tools like Process Explorer (Microsoft) or `strace` (Linux).\n3. Inspect the contents of these files to see if they differ significantly from each other. This could help pinpoint why new versions are being created.\n4.
