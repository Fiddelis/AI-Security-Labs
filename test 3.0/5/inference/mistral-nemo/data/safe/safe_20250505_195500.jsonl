{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, here's a summary of what happened:\n\n1. **Offline Language Packs Installation**\n   - A process named `SDXHelper.exe` created multiple files in the following directory:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\ClickToRun\\officelayoutx64\\LanguageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n     ```\n   - These files are language packs for Microsoft Office, as indicated by their names (e.g., `id-id-ui-strings-json_1234567890.js`, `es-es-ui-strings-json_a987654321.js`, etc.).\n   - The process was likely triggered by an update or manual installation of language packs for Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **Office Activity**\n   - An `EXCEL.EXE` process performed the following actions:\n     - Made a DNS query (this could be related to online resources used within Excel, like web queries, add-ins, etc.).\n     - Set registry values (possibly related to user preferences or application settings).\n   - These events are typical of regular Office activity.\n\n3. **Windows System Activity**\n   - A `svchost.exe` process performed multiple registry operations:\n     - Added\/deleted registry objects\n     - Set registry values\n   - These actions could be related to Windows system services, updates, or other background tasks running on the machine.\n\nIn summary, these logs suggest routine Office activity and typical Windows system behavior. There's no apparent sign of suspicious or malicious activities in the provided logs. However, if you have concerns about specific events or need further analysis, please let me know!"}

There are two distinct processes involved:\n\n1. **Excel Process (EXCEL.EXE):**\n   - This process appears 7 times, with no associated files created. It seems to be idle or performing other operations not logged here.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe Process:**\n   - This process is associated with the creation of various JSON and JavaScript files in the context of Microsoft Office Solution Packages. These files appear to be related to UI strings for different languages (e.g., 'en-US', 'zh-CN') and offline files, as well as other Office-related files like 'transcription-strings.min.js' and 'taskpane.js'.\n\n**Juspay's Summary:**\n\n- **Process:** SDXHelper.exe\n- **Operations:** File creation\n- **Files Created:**\n  - JSON files for UI strings in different languages (e.g., en-US, zh-CN)\n  - Offline files with various language codes (e.g., lv-lv, lt-lt)\n  - Other Office-related files: transcription-strings.min.js and taskpane.js\n- **No Interesting or Malicious Activities Detected**\n\n**Juspay's Confidence:** High.
