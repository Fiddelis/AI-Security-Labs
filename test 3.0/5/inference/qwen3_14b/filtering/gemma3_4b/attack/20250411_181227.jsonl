So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, the main thing here is to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that are creating scheduled tasks. The command lines show the use of New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe as the executable. That's odd because calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but using it in scheduled tasks might not be normal. Also, the triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running tasks with admin rights can be a sign of privilege escalation or malicious activity.\n\nNow, there are several entries with the same pattern, each time registering a different task name like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The repetition of similar commands might indicate an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, which could be part of a larger attack, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, there are logs about PowerShell processes accessing the registry and being created. The ImageLoad events show that PowerShell is loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. While these are legitimate components, the combination with the scheduled task creation might suggest that PowerShell is being used for more than just simple scripting—maybe to execute malicious code.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any actual malicious payload here. All the commands are using calc.exe, which is a benign process. But the method of creating scheduled tasks with admin rights is suspicious. Even though calc.exe is legitimate, the context here is concerning. The fact that multiple tasks are created with the same structure could be an indicator of automated scripts or part of a larger attack vector.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes and registry access could be part of a broader attack, like trying to establish persistence or modify system settings. The ImageLoad events might be normal, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it's worth investigating further.\n\nI don't see any direct evidence of malware here, but the suspicious activity patterns—multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights, repeated PowerShell commands—suggest that this is worth looking into. The user might want to check if these tasks are part of a legitimate setup or if they're being used for malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **potentially suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repeated Scheduled Task Creation with PowerShell**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with **`calc.exe`** as the executable. While `calc.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, its use in scheduled tasks (especially with elevated privileges) is unusual and may indicate **misuse for persistence or obfuscation**.\n   - **Example Command**:\n     ```powershell\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -RunLevel Highest -UserId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\"\n     Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n     ```\n   - **Red Flags**:\n     - **`RunLevel Highest`**: Tasks running with administrative privileges.\n     - **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`**: Suggests attempts to escalate privileges or bypass user-level restrictions.\n     - **Repetition of Task Names**: Indicates possible **automated or scripted deployment** of tasks.\n\n2. **Loading .NET Assemblies**:\n   - PowerShell processes are loading .NET DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc.). While these are legitimate, their presence **combined with suspicious task creation** could indicate **exploitation of PowerShell for malicious code execution** (e.g., via [PowerShell Empire](https:\/\/www.hacktools.net\/powershell-empire\/) or similar frameworks).\n\n3. **High Volume of PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple logs show **`Process Create`**, **`Image Load`**, and **`Registry Access`** events related to PowerShell. This could signal **lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence attempts**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**\n- **Scheduled Tasks with Admin Rights**: A common technique for **persistence** in malware (e.g., **CoinMiner**, **PowerSploit**).\n- **PowerShell Misuse**: PowerShell is often used in **post-exploitation phases** (e.g., **credential dumping, privilege escalation**).\n- **Lack of Clear Malicious Payload**: While `calc.exe` is benign, the **context** (task creation, .NET loading) raises concerns about **hidden payloads or obfuscation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Check the **task details** (e.g., via `Get-ScheduledTask` or Task Scheduler GUI) to confirm if they are legitimate.\n   - Look for **unusual triggers, actions, or authors**.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Use **PowerShell logging** (e.g., `AuditPolicy` or **PSModule** like [PSLog](https:\/\/github.com\/PowerShell\/PSLog)) to trace the origin of the commands.\n   - Check for **obfuscation** in the scripts (e.g., encoded commands, use of `Invoke-Expression`).\n\n3. **Check for .NET-Based Malware**:\n   - Use tools like **ProcMon** or **ProcDot** to monitor **file system and registry activity** related to the loaded .NET DLLs.\n   - Scan for **unusual .NET assemblies** (e.g., via **YARA rules** or **Malwarebytes**).\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Look for **network activity** (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections) from the affected systems.\n   - Check **user account activity** (e.g., logons, privilege changes).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **highly suspicious behavior** (e.g., scheduled task creation with admin rights, PowerShell misuse). While no direct malware is evident, the **context and repetition** of these activities strongly suggest **potential compromise**. Immediate investigation is recommended. \n\n**Severity**: ⚠️ **High** (Potential persistence or privilege escalation)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions \"Image loaded\" for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a script file could be suspicious, especially if it's a PowerShell script. The next event is a pipe created, which might be part of normal operations but could also be a red flag if used for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell command line that creates a scheduled task to run calc.exe with high privileges for Administrators. That seems like a potential security risk because it's setting up a task that runs with elevated rights. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate program, the method of creating it via scheduled task with such permissions might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with registry value sets. If Chrome is modifying its own registry settings, that might be normal, but if it's doing so in a way that's unexpected or in large numbers, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, since all these events are for Chrome, maybe they're just part of normal operations, like updates or extensions.\n\nThe most concerning parts are the PowerShell activities. The scheduled task creation with high privileges and the temporary script file being created and deleted might indicate an attempt to execute code with elevated rights. Also, the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with the process as None are a bit odd. If the process is not identified, that could mean the event is from a source that's not being logged properly or it's an indicator of a potential attack where the process is obfuscated or hidden.\n\nHowever, I should check if any of these are false positives. For example, Windows Defender loading its own DLLs is normal. The temporary script might be part of a legitimate PowerShell operation, but the fact that it's immediately deleted could be an attempt to hide evidence. The scheduled task creation is suspicious, especially if it's setting up a task that runs as Administrators with high privileges. \n\nThe confidence here might be around 0.7 because while there are some suspicious activities, not all of them are definitely malicious. The presence of both legitimate and potentially malicious events makes it a bit ambiguous. But the combination of creating a scheduled task with high privileges and the temporary script suggests that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential malicious activity, including creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators) to execute calc.exe, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events with unknown processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes malicious software can use WMI. However, taskschd.dll is a system file, so maybe normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple svchost.exe entries with Registry value set. Svchost is common, but if there are multiple registry changes, that could be suspicious. But maybe just normal system operations. Need to check if there's a pattern.\n\nAnother svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, System32\\Tasks is where scheduled tasks are stored. Creating a new task there might be a red flag. Could be a scheduled task being added, which might be malicious.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None and task 'Execute a Remote Command'. That's odd. If the process is None, maybe it's a log without a clear source, but executing remote commands is definitely suspicious. Could be a sign of remote access or command execution.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and other download directories. PowerShell is often used by attackers. Creating files in user directories might not be bad, but if they're scripts or configuration files, that's a concern. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in download directories could be normal if it's a log file, but need to check.\n\nChrome.exe has several registry changes and image loads. Chrome is a common browser, but multiple registry changes might indicate something. However, loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are legitimate system files used for antivirus. Maybe that's normal.\n\nThe Dns query from chrome.exe could be normal browsing, but if there's a lot of unusual domains, that might be a problem. But the data here doesn't specify the domain, so can't tell.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: there's a combination of registry changes, file creation in system directories, remote command execution, and PowerShell activities. Even though some events are normal, the presence of multiple suspicious activities like executing remote commands and creating files in system directories might indicate a potential security incident. However, some entries could be benign. The confidence isn't extremely high, but enough to flag as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including remote command execution (unusual process 'None'), svchost.exe creating a file in the system tasks directory, and PowerShell creating files in user directories. These could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
