First, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe is doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's powershell.exe involved. The next events show powershell.exe performing actions like registry value sets, process creation, and accessing files. \n\nWait, there's a specific command line in one of the events: it's using WebClient to download a file from a GitHub raw URL. The URL seems legitimate, but the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files multiple times might be a red flag. Also, the files are being saved to the TEMP directory, which is common in malware operations. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell downloading different LICENSE.txt files from various GitHub repositories. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the pattern of downloading multiple files, especially with names like \"LICENSE.txt\" which might be benign but could also be part of a larger attack. \n\nThen there's the file creation and deletion events. A temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. This could be part of a script that's executing and cleaning up, which is often seen in malicious activities. \n\nAlso, the image loaded events show .NET assemblies being loaded, which might be normal for PowerShell scripts, but combined with the other activities, it could indicate something more. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any actual malicious activity.

The presence of multiple downloads and the use of temporary files might be suspicious. \n\nBut there's no direct evidence of malware here, like execution of malicious code or connection to known bad IPs. The events are more about process and file operations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON log entries, and I need to analyze them as a whole to see if there's any malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. There are a few PowerShell commands that download files from GitHub. The URLs look like they're fetching LICENSE.txt files from different repositories. But wait, GitHub is a common place for open-source projects, so maybe that's normal. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files might be suspicious, especially if it's not part of routine operations. But then again, some legitimate scripts might do that too.\n\nLooking at the file creation events, there are a few files created in the user's Downloads folder, like 'elemento_padrao.txt' and 'entrada_base.txt'. Creating files in Downloads isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the PowerShell downloads, it could be part of something. However, the filenames are generic, which might be normal.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe process with multiple registry value set events. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, so maybe that's a red flag. But if the user is doing something with Chrome extensions or settings, it could be legitimate. The repetition of the same event might indicate something automated or a potential issue.\n\nAnother thing is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating configuration files, that's normal. But there are multiple entries for the same file path, which might be redundant or an error.\n\nThe 'MpDefenderCoreService.exe' has a network connection detected. That's part of Windows Defender, so that's probably legitimate. The 'conhost.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe' also have registry events, but those are standard Windows processes. \n\nLooking at the PowerShell events again, the command lines use WebClient to download files. This is a common technique for downloading payloads, which could be part of an attack. However, since the URLs point to GitHub, which is a public repository, maybe the user is just testing or using legitimate scripts. But the repetition of similar commands might indicate automated or repeated attempts.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event for PowerShell might be part of a script's normal operation, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger process. Also, the 'Image loaded' event points to a Defender DLL, which is normal.\n\nConsidering all the events, the main suspicious points are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub and the registry modifications by Chrome. However, without more context, it's hard to say if these are malicious. The presence of multiple similar events might indicate a pattern worth investigating. But since the files are from GitHub and some processes are standard, it might not be a high priority. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple PowerShell commands downloading files, which could be part of a malicious activity, even if the sources are public. The repetition and the combination with registry changes might indicate something that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Downloads from GitHub Repositories:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `System.Net.WebClient` to download `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `https:\/\/github.com\/...\/raw\/...\/LICENSE.txt`). \n   - **Why this matters:** While GitHub is a legitimate source, the use of PowerShell to download files in this manner is often associated with **malicious scripts** (e.g., downloading payloads, executing code remotely, or exfiltrating data). The repetition of similar commands across different repositories raises concerns about **automated or repeated activity**.\n\n2. **File Creation in User Downloads Folder:**\n   - Files like `entrada_base.txt` and `elemento_padrao.txt` are created in the user's Downloads directory. \n   - **Why this matters:** While not inherently malicious, this could indicate **data exfiltration** or **staging files** for further attacks. The filenames are generic, which might mask their true purpose.\n\n3. **Unusual Registry Modifications by Chrome:**\n   - `chrome.exe` triggers multiple `Registry value set` events. Chrome typically does not modify the registry extensively, so this could indicate **tampering** (e.g., injecting malicious extensions or altering settings).\n\n4. **Repetitive File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) creates `.yml.new` files in its data directory multiple times. \n   - **Why this matters:** While normal during configuration updates, the repetition might suggest **configuration errors**, **malicious tampering**, or **unauthorized access** to the log shipper's directory.\n\n5. **Network Activity by `MpDefenderCoreService.exe`:**\n   - Although legitimate (part of Windows Defender), the event is logged alongside suspicious PowerShell activity. This could be a **red herring** or a **coincidental correlation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activities:**\n- **Standard Processes:** Events involving `notepad.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` are typical for Windows operations.\n- **Winlogbeat Configuration:** File creation by `winlogbeat.exe` could be part of routine configuration updates.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**Classification: INTERESTING**  \nThe combination of **PowerShell-based downloads from GitHub**, **unusual registry modifications by Chrome**, and **repetitive file creation** suggests potential malicious activity (e.g., data exfiltration, script execution, or configuration tampering). While some events are benign, the **pattern of PowerShell activity** and **anomalies in Chrome and Winlogbeat behavior** warrant further investigation (e.g., inspecting the downloaded files, checking for unauthorized extensions, or reviewing network traffic)."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe there's something else. Then there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process, but repeated registry changes might be suspicious. \n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading the same urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. Usually, it's calc.exe. Maybe a typo or a renamed malicious executable? Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command trying to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task might be part of cleaning up after an attack. Then, another cmd.exe command deletes a registry value under HKCU Run. That could be removing a persistence mechanism. \n\nThere's also reg.exe deleting another registry value. Multiple registry deletions and modifications could indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe with commands that manipulate the registry and scheduled tasks suggests possible malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be normal system activities. For example, svchost.exe and registry changes can be part of legitimate operations. But the combination of multiple suspicious commands, the use of Calculator.exe (which is unusual), and the deletion of registry entries and scheduled tasks points towards a potential attack. \n\nThe confidence isn't 100% because some events could be benign, but the overall pattern is concerning.

There are several entries where PowerShell loads .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's normal because PowerShell often uses .NET components. But wait, there's also a mention of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. That might be legitimate, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a red flag. It might be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily without leaving traces. Also, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events and Registry value sets might indicate some level of system manipulation.\n\nHowever, there are also normal activities like the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file, which seems related to a legitimate tool (Winlogbeat). The conhost.exe event is also normal, as it's part of the Windows console host.\n\nBut the key points here are the temporary file creation and deletion, along with the multiple PowerShell activities. While some of these could be benign, the combination might suggest an attempt to execute a script that's being cleaned up afterward.

There are multiple entries of Process Create, Process Access, and Registry value set events. Also, there are Image Load events pointing to various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the repeated use of PowerShell. While PowerShell is a common tool, excessive usage, especially with commands like \"powershell.exe & {}\" which is a no-op, might indicate something unusual. Also, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory could be a red flag. That file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1, which might be part of a script execution that's being cleaned up afterward.\n\nAnother point is the loading of specific DLLs. The presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could be normal, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger pattern. The user mentioned \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, which might relate to PowerShell's interaction with the system.\n\nHowever, there's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. The 'cmd.exe' processes are also normal.

But I need to check other entries too.\n\nThen there's a process with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an empty command. Not sure if that's a problem, but maybe a placeholder or test. The next entries show powershell.exe loading various DLLs like MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but the path is in ProgramData, which sometimes can be used by malware. \n\nAnother entry has a File created in the user's AppData directory. That's common for some legitimate apps, but could also be where malware stores data. The command line for one powershell.exe instance is removing a file named objeto_principal.zip from the temp directory. Removing a file might be normal, but if it's part of a larger sequence of actions, it could be trying to clean up after itself.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool to check the current user, so that's probably benign. However, the repeated use of PowerShell for registry modifications and process accesses, combined with the file operations, might indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's no direct evidence of malware, but the combination of multiple suspicious activities (registry changes, file creation, image loading from possible legitimate paths, and cleanup actions) could be indicative of an attack. However, without more context like network activity or unexpected binaries, it's hard to be certain. So, I'd say this is interesting but not a high confidence. Maybe around 0.6 or 0.7.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: PowerShell is running a command to remove a file named unidade_base.txt from the TEMP directory. The command uses -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, which might be trying to delete files without causing errors. That's a bit suspicious because usually, deleting files in TEMP could be part of normal operations, but combined with other events, it might be something else.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about PowerShell processes with various tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, and File created or deleted. The Image loaded events show that PowerShell is loading several DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs isn't unusual, but the fact that it's loading multiple from different locations might be a red flag. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory.

The repetition of similar commands might indicate an attempt to clean up after some activity, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. The use of $env:TEMP suggests that the attacker is using temporary files, which is a common tactic.\n\nThere's also a File created event for a .yml.new file related to winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be a legitimate activity if someone is configuring it, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it's unclear. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events with file deletions and registry changes could point to something malicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's internal processes, but again, the frequency and the combination with other events could be suspicious. Also, the fact that the same user (fiddelis) is involved in these activities might be a clue, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is a standard command to check user privileges, which might be part of reconnaissance.

While some of these could be legitimate, the pattern of deleting files in TEMP, combined with the use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, and the repetition of similar commands, suggests that this might be part of a malicious activity. The user might want to investigate further to confirm if this is a false positive or an actual security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation due to potential indicators of suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity with File Deletion**:\n   - Multiple `Remove-Item` commands targeting files in the `%TEMP%` directory (e.g., `unidade_base.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`, etc.) using `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore`. This suggests an attempt to **clean up temporary files** without errors, a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\n2. **Unusual File Lifecycle**:\n   - Files are created (e.g., `objeto_padrao.txt`, `.winlogbeat.yml.new`) and immediately deleted (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`), which could indicate **ephemeral operations** or attempts to execute payloads in memory.\n\n3. **Loading of System DLLs**:\n   - PowerShell processes are loading DLLs from **Windows Defender** (`MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and **.NET Framework** components. While not inherently malicious, the **volume** and **repetition** of such events could indicate exploitation of legitimate processes for malicious purposes.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving PowerShell and `conhost.exe` suggest potential **registry tampering**, which is often used to persist malware or modify system behavior.\n\n5. **Command-Line Patterns**:\n   - Repeated use of `Remove-Item` on `%TEMP%` files and the involvement of `whoami.exe` (to check user context) align with **reconnaissance and cleanup phases** of attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**: \n  - PowerShell is a legitimate tool, and temporary file deletion is common in scripts. Windows Defender DLLs are part of standard system operations.\n  - `winlogbeat` configuration files might be part of log management activities.\n\n- **Red Flags**:\n  - **Lack of clear purpose** for file deletions (e.g., no corresponding creation of new files or user context).\n  - **Repetition of similar commands** across multiple events, which is less common in benign scripts.\n  - **Absence of user-initiated actions** (e.g., no visible user interaction or application launches).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network traffic** from PowerShell processes (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Investigate **parent processes** of PowerShell to identify if it was launched by a legitimate application or a malicious binary.\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Examine deleted files (if possible via forensic tools) for malicious payloads or scripts.\n   - Check the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file for configuration anomalies.\n\n3. **Monitor User Activity**:\n   - Investigate the user **fiddelis** for other suspicious behavior (e.g., elevated privileges, access to sensitive resources).\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Audit registry keys modified by PowerShell for **startup entries** or **scheduled tasks**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity could be benign, the **combination of file deletion, registry changes, and repetitive PowerShell commands** raises concerns about potential **malicious activity** (e.g., malware cleanup, persistence, or data exfiltration). Further investigation is recommended to confirm or rule out a security threat."}
