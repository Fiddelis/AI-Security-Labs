The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe with network connection events. That's normal, as Chrome often connects to the internet. But then there's a powershell.exe process that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. The command line shows a WebClient downloading a LICENSE.txt file to the Temp directory. That seems a bit odd because downloading a license file might be benign, but doing it multiple times from different repositories could be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell pointing to .NET DLLs. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, the repeated FileCreate and FileDelete events in the Temp folder might indicate temporary files being used, which isn't necessarily bad. But then there's a Pipe Created event, which could be part of normal operations or something more malicious.\n\nWait, the command lines for PowerShell are all downloading LICENSE.txt from various GitHub repos. That's a common technique for attackers to exfiltrate data or execute scripts. Also, the fact that it's using WebClient to download files might be a sign of a script being run, especially if the files are being downloaded to temporary directories. \n\nBut are these URLs malicious? The GitHub links might be legitimate, but the fact that they're being accessed multiple times and the paths are similar (like modulo_padrao.txt) might indicate automated or repeated downloads. Also, the presence of multiple registry events for both Chrome and PowerShell could be indicative of configuration changes, but again, that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nHmm, but the key point here is the repeated PowerShell activities involving downloading files from GitHub. Even though the files are LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign, the fact that they're being downloaded multiple times and the use of PowerShell for such actions might be part of a larger attack. However, without more context like the actual content of the downloaded files or other suspicious activities, it's a bit hard to tell. \n\nBut considering the classification criteria, the presence of multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, even if they are license files, might be considered suspicious. However, if these are part of normal operations (like using GitHub for legitimate purposes), then it might not be interesting. But given that the user is asking for potential malicious behavior, the repeated downloads and the use of PowerShell could be a sign of something worth investigating.\n\nSo, I think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub, even if they're license files, might be part of a larger attack or data exfiltration attempt. The confidence is around 0.75 because while it's not definitive, the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub repositories (e.g., LICENSE.txt) to temporary directories, which may indicate data exfiltration or script execution.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a PowerShell command that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. The URL is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" and saves it to the temporary directory. Hmm, downloading files from external sources can be a red flag, especially if it's not a known or trusted source. But GitHub is a common place for code, so maybe it's legitimate. However, the fact that it's using PowerShell to download a file might be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell.exe being executed. Some of them have commands like \"File created\" and \"Registry value set.\" Creating files and modifying the registry are normal operations, but when combined with other suspicious actions, they could indicate something malicious. For example, creating a file in the Downloads directory might not be suspicious on its own, but if it's part of a pattern, it could be.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn.\" Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up after a malicious activity. Also, there's a command to delete registry keys under \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run,\" which is where startup programs are stored. Removing entries here could be an attempt to hide malicious software from running at startup.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry events, especially with PowerShell and cmd.exe, suggests that the attacker might be modifying system settings. The use of \"REG DELETE\" and \"REG ADD\" commands could be part of changing configurations or hiding their tracks.\n\nThere's also a mention of \"whoami.exe,\" which is a legitimate tool, but when combined with other suspicious commands, it might be used to gather information about the system for further attacks.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these activities are normal. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating files or modifying the registry isn't inherently malicious. But the combination of multiple such events, especially involving downloading files from external sources and modifying startup entries, raises concerns.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. If these are part of a normal user's activities, they might not be a problem, but if they're part of a script or automated process that's not supposed to be there, that's a red flag.\n\nI should also check for any known malicious indicators. The GitHub URL mentioned is for a LICENSE.txt file, which is typically a benign file. However, the path where the file is saved ($env:TEMP\\tarefa_ativo.txt) might be used as a temporary storage for malicious scripts. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several PowerShell executions, registry modifications, and file creations. While some of these could be legitimate, the combination and the specific commands (like deleting tasks and registry entries) suggest that there might be an attempt to install or execute malicious code. The presence of multiple registry events and the use of SCHTASKS could indicate persistence mechanisms being set up or removed, which is common in malware.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine if it's part of a malicious activity or just normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential **malicious activity** or **unauthorized system modifications**. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual PowerShell Activity**\n- **File Download from External Source**:  \n  A PowerShell command downloads a file from a GitHub URL (`https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt`) and saves it to the system's temporary directory (`$env:TEMP\\tarefa_ativo.txt`).  \n  - **Risk**: While GitHub is a legitimate source, downloading executable content or scripts from external repositories (especially into temporary directories) is a **common tactic in malware campaigns**.  \n  - **Note**: The file name (`LICENSE.txt`) is benign, but the **use of PowerShell for execution** and **temporary storage** could mask malicious payloads.\n\n- **Empty PowerShell Commands**:  \n  Multiple entries show `powershell.exe & {}` (empty script blocks). This may indicate **failed attempts** to execute malicious code or **probes** to test system defenses.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Registry Modifications**\n- **Deletion of Startup Entries**:  \n  Commands like `REG DELETE` and `SCHTASKS \/DELETE` target entries in the **`HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`** registry key, which stores **startup programs**.  \n  - **Risk**: Removing legitimate startup entries could be an attempt to **hide malicious software** or **prevent detection**.  \n  - **Note**: This aligns with **malware persistence techniques** to ensure continued execution after system reboots.\n\n- **Frequent Registry Events**:  \n  Repeated `Registry value set` and `Registry object added\/deleted` events (via `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) suggest **system configuration tampering**. This could indicate **malware installation**, **credential theft**, or **anti-forensic measures**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Process Execution and Persistence**\n- **Multiple PowerShell and CMD Executions**:  \n  The logs show **repeated use of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`** for tasks like file creation, registry modification, and task deletion.  \n  - **Risk**: This could indicate **script-based attacks** (e.g., PowerShell Empire, Cobalt Strike) or **manual exploitation** by an attacker.  \n  - **Note**: The use of `SCHTASKS` to delete tasks (e.g., `spawn`) may be an attempt to **clean up traces** of malicious activity.\n\n- **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events**:  \n  Entries like `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` (e.g., `powershell.exe & {}`) may indicate **malware execution frameworks** or **custom scripts** being deployed.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Lack of Contextual Legitimacy**\n- **No Clear Justification for Activity**:  \n  The logs show **no legitimate business purpose** for the observed actions (e.g., software installation, system updates).  \n  - **Risk**: The absence of context (e.g., user-initiated tasks, software deployment) raises concerns about **unauthorized access** or **compromised systems**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Likely Malicious Activity**\nThe combination of **unusual PowerShell usage**, **registry tampering**, **startup entry deletion**, and **repeated process executions** strongly suggests **malicious intent**. While some actions (e.g., downloading a `LICENSE.txt` file) could be benign, the **pattern and lack of context** point to **potential compromise**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps**\n1. **Analyze the downloaded file** (`LICENSE.txt`) for hidden payloads or scripts.  \n2. **Investigate user accounts** associated with the PowerShell\/cmd.exe executions.  \n3. **Check for other malicious artifacts** (e.g., new files, registry keys, scheduled tasks).  \n4. **Scan the system** for malware using updated antivirus tools.  \n5. **Review system logs** for additional anomalies (e.g., failed login attempts, unusual network traffic).  \n\nThis batch of logs is **highly suspicious** and requires immediate forensic analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking through the entries, most of them involve PowerShell.exe. There are several instances where PowerShell is loading images, like mscoree.dll, clrjit.dll, and some other .dll files. Also, there are file creations in the Temp directory, which might be normal, but sometimes malicious scripts use Temp folders to store temporary files. \n\nWait, but there's also a mention of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. That's part of Windows Defender, so maybe that's legitimate. However, the repeated loading of these DLLs might be normal, but I should check if there's any unusual pattern.\n\nThen there are events related to registry value sets and process creations. The command lines for PowerShell are often \"& {}\" which is an empty script block. That might be a sign of something trying to execute without actual commands, maybe obfuscation or evasion techniques. \n\nAlso, the same processes like conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and chrome.exe are appearing, but those are common system processes. However, the fact that PowerShell is involved in multiple ImageLoad events could be significant. \n\nI need to check if there's any suspicious activity. For example, creating files in Temp is common, but if it's done multiple times or with unusual names, that might be a red flag. The file names here are __PSScriptPolicyTest... which seems like a test script, maybe part of a legitimate process, but maybe not. \n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events might be normal, but if they're part of a larger attack, they could be indicators. Also, the fact that multiple registry events are happening could indicate configuration changes or attempts to persist. \n\nHowever, without more context, like the user's environment or known good behavior, it's hard to say. But the presence of multiple PowerShell-related events, especially with ImageLoad and FileCreate, along with the empty script blocks, might indicate something malicious. \n\nOn the other hand, some of these could be false positives. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, and loading .NET DLLs is normal. But the combination of these events might be more telling. \n\nI think the key points here are the multiple ImageLoads of specific DLLs, the file creation in Temp, and the use of PowerShell with empty command lines. These could be signs of a script trying to execute without being detected, or maybe part of a larger attack. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'd classify this as INTERESTING because there are multiple suspicious activities that could indicate a potential security incident, even though some might be benign.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking through the events, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several process create, process access, image loaded, and file delete events.\n\nHmm, the first event is a PowerShell process trying to remove a zip file from the TEMP directory. Then there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes with commands that remove various .zip and .txt files from the TEMP directory. The command lines all use Remove-Item with paths in $env:TEMP, which is a common temp directory. The fact that they're using -ErrorAction Ignore might be a way to suppress errors if the files don't exist, which is normal, but the repetition could be suspicious.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe part of normal PowerShell operations. But there's also a mention of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. That might be normal too, but sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to hide their activities.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a whoami.exe process, which is just checking the user, so that's normal. Then there's a File Created and then immediately File Delete logged for a temporary PowerShell script. That could be part of normal script execution, but the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe multiple removal commands for different files in the TEMP directory might indicate that someone is cleaning up after themselves, which is common in malicious activities. However, it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate script that's just managing temporary files. The key here is the combination of events. The repeated use of Remove-Item on multiple files, along with the image loads and process accesses, might suggest that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not typical for normal user activities. \n\nBut I need to be careful. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be normal, but if there are other suspicious activities, that could be a sign. The fact that there are several events related to the same user (fiddelis) might be a clue, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of $env:TEMP, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. The fact that the files are being deleted after use could be an attempt to avoid detection. However, this is also a common practice in legitimate scripts as well. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes removing various files from the TEMP directory, along with the image loads and the creation and deletion of a temporary script, could indicate a potential security threat. But it's not definitive. The logs don't show any obvious malicious payloads or network activity, but the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, this might be considered interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs exhibit a pattern of activity that warrants further investigation due to the following suspicious behaviors:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion:**\n1. **Frequent File Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute `Remove-Item` commands targeting `.zip` and `.txt` files in `$env:TEMP` (e.g., `tarefa_base.txt`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`). The use of `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` suggests an attempt to suppress errors, which is common in cleanup operations but could indicate post-exploitation activity or evasion tactics.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation and Immediate Deletion:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`) is created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted. This behavior is often seen in malicious scripts to avoid leaving traces, though it could also be part of legitimate automation.\n\n3. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity:**\n   - The logs show repeated `Process Create`, `Process Access`, and `Image Load` events for PowerShell, including loading of .NET DLLs (`mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clr.dll`) and Windows Defender components (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`). While some of these are legitimate, the sheer volume and repetitive nature may indicate misuse of PowerShell for obfuscation or lateral movement.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose:**\n   - The deletion of multiple files with generic names (e.g., `tarefa_base.txt`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`) lacks context for a legitimate use case. This could signal the removal of payloads, logs, or other artifacts after execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Cleanup:** The deletion of files in `$env:TEMP` may be part of a cleanup routine after executing malicious code.\n- **Persistence or Evasion:** The use of PowerShell and temporary script creation\/deletion could be part of a strategy to avoid detection (e.g., by memory-resident malware or scripts).\n- **Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movement:** Repeated PowerShell activity might indicate exploitation of vulnerabilities or attempts to move laterally within the network.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for network traffic, registry changes, or user behavior anomalies around the time of these events.\n   - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell commands (e.g., is the user `fiddelis` a legitimate user? Are these commands part of a scheduled task or script?).\n\n2. **Analyze the Deleted Script:**\n   - If possible, reconstruct the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`) from memory dumps or residual artifacts to determine its purpose.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Implement logging and monitoring for PowerShell commands, especially those involving file deletion, execution of scripts, or interaction with sensitive directories.\n\n4. **Check for Exploits:**\n   - Investigate whether any known exploits (e.g., PowerShell-based attacks like `PowerSploit`) are associated with the observed behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not definitively confirm malicious activity, the combination of **repeated file deletion in the Temp directory**, **temporary script creation\/deletion**, and **high PowerShell activity** raises a **moderate to high risk of compromise**. Further investigation is strongly recommended to rule out adversarial activity."}

The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which might be part of a configuration change, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. Multiple Process accessed events, which could be normal, but combined with the file deletions and the File created events, maybe there's something going on.
