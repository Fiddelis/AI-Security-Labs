{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not a red flag yet. But then I see several entries involving powershell.exe. \n\nOne of the events has a command line that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub raw URL. The URL is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_base\/objeto_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" and saves it to a temporary file. Wait, downloading a LICENSE.txt file from GitHub might be benign, but the fact that it's done via PowerShell could be a sign. Also, there are multiple similar events with different URLs, like \"unidade_base\/componente_base\" and others. \n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the Temp directory and then deletes it. That could be part of a script execution, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the downloads, it might be part of a larger process. \n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be worth noting, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub, especially with different repositories, might be suspicious. Typically, PowerShell is used for scripting, and downloading files from external sources could be part of a malicious activity, like executing a script or downloading a payload. The fact that the files are saved to the Temp directory and then deleted could be an attempt to hide the activity. \n\nAlso, there are events related to registry value sets and process access, which could indicate changes to the system configuration or attempts to manipulate processes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if these are malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch includes multiple PowerShell activities involving downloading files from external sources, creating and deleting temporary files, and some registry changes. While some of these actions are normal, the combination and frequency might indicate a potential security incident, such as a script being executed that's downloading and running code from external repositories. This could be a sign of a malicious actor trying to execute code on the system. Therefore, the batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are observed downloading files from GitHub repositories (e.g., 'raw.githubusercontent.com') into temporary directories, which is a common technique in malicious scripts.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with chrome.exe and registry value set events. That might be normal, but I should check for any suspicious patterns. Then there's a powershell.exe event where it's downloading a file from a GitHub URL. Wait, the URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting text files. The filename is LICENSE.txt, which is typical for open-source projects. But the command line shows a PowerShell script using WebClient to download a file. That could be benign, but sometimes attackers use similar methods to download malicious payloads. However, in this case, the file is a LICENSE.txt, which is less likely to be malicious. Still, the fact that it's downloading from an external source might be worth noting.\n\nNext, there's a File created event for a PowerShell startup profile. That might be part of normal user configuration. Then, multiple entries with powershell.exe and Registry value set. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The winlogbeat.exe events are about creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe the user is configuring it, which is normal. However, the repeated creation of .yml.new files might be part of a configuration process, but again, not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThere's a network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. That's probably legitimate. The Calculator.exe and urlmon.dll image loaded events are normal since urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer and used for web content. The svchost.exe and Registry value set events are common for system services, but again, need to check for unusual activity.\n\nThe whoami.exe command is just checking the user identity, which is normal. The cmd.exe event is deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" with \/F, which is forceful deletion. Deleting a scheduled task might be part of cleanup, but if \"spawn\" was a legitimate task, this could be suspicious. However, without knowing the task's purpose, it's hard to say. The cmd.exe and Registry value set events could be part of normal system operations or possibly malicious if they're modifying critical registry keys.\n\nPutting this all together, there are a few potentially suspicious activities: the PowerShell download, the deletion of a scheduled task, and multiple registry changes. However, many of these events could be part of normal user or system operations. The presence of winlogbeat suggests monitoring is in place, which is good. The GitHub download might be benign, but the combination of registry changes and process accesses could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges. However, without more context or evidence of malicious payloads or unexpected behavior, it's a bit ambiguous. I think the confidence is moderate. Maybe the classification is INTERESTING because there are several events that could indicate tampering or unauthorized changes, but not conclusive enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n1. **PowerShell Download from GitHub**  \n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a script to download `LICENSE.txt` from `raw.githubusercontent.com`. While GitHub is a legitimate source, this could be a red flag if the file is being used as a payload (e.g., obfuscated scripts). However, `LICENSE.txt` is typically benign.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Deletion**  \n   - A `cmd.exe` process deleted a scheduled task named **\"spawn\"** using `\/F` (forceful deletion). This could indicate cleanup of malicious tasks, but the absence of context (e.g., what the task did) makes it ambiguous.\n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `svchost.exe` modifying registry values. While registry changes are common, repeated modifications without clear purpose may suggest attempts to tamper with system settings or evade detection.\n\n4. **Process Access Events**  \n   - Repeated `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` could indicate attempts to monitor or manipulate other processes, though this is not conclusive without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**:  \n  The creation of `.yml.new` files in the downloads directory is likely part of configuring a log shipper (e.g., Winlogbeat), which is a legitimate monitoring tool.\n\n- **Normal System Processes**:  \n  - `svchost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`, and `urlmon.dll` are standard system components.  \n  - `whoami.exe` is a common diagnostic tool.  \n  - `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` (Windows Defender) initiating a network connection is expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **moderate risk**. While many events are benign, the combination of **unusual registry modifications**, **scheduled task deletion**, and **PowerShell activity downloading external files** warrants further investigation. These could indicate either legitimate configuration changes or early stages of a compromise (e.g., post-exploitation activity).\n\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING**  \n**Confidence**: **Moderate** (requires deeper analysis of the downloaded file, registry changes, and task deletion context)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of schtasks.exe with the command to delete a task named \"spawn\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task could be part of an attacker trying to remove their own malicious task. Then there's a bunch of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe, especially around registry modifications. The command lines show REG DELETE commands targeting the Run keys in the registry, which are often used for persistence. Also, there's a lot of Process Create and Process Access events for PowerShell, which is common in attacks. The ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs might indicate that PowerShell is being used to load .NET assemblies, which can be part of executing malicious code. The repeated use of whoami.exe could be checking user context. However, some of these events might be benign, like normal system processes. But the combination of deleting a scheduled task, modifying registry Run keys, and heavy PowerShell activity points towards potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high but not certain, so maybe around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of a scheduled task named 'spawn', repeated registry modifications in Run keys, and extensive PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage with potential persistence mechanisms.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe is involved with the task 'Image loaded' pointing to MpOAV.dll. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, right? So that's a legitimate file. Maybe a normal process, but I should note that.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces. The file name has a random string, which might be a sign of obfuscation. But then there's a 'File Delete logged' event, which is normal, but the quick creation and deletion could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's a 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's just a normal system process, maybe not an issue. But combined with other events, it might be part of something else.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's 'powershell.exe & {}' which seems like an empty command. That might be a placeholder or a failed attempt. Also, multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line. Maybe the system is logging a lot of PowerShell activities, but some of them are just normal operations.\n\nThen there are several 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to tell. The fact that multiple processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and cmd.exe are modifying the registry might be a red flag.\n\nThe 'Process accessed' events might indicate that some process is trying to interact with another, which could be benign or malicious. But combined with other events, it's worth looking into.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for .NET assemblies are normal, but the presence of multiple such events could be part of a larger process. However, the main concern here is the Temp file creation and deletion, which is a common indicator of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might indicate that the system is handling a lot of PowerShell-related activities, which could be a sign of something being done intentionally.\n\nPutting this all together: the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script, along with multiple registry modifications and process accesses, might indicate an attempt to execute a script and then clean up. However, some of these events could be normal. The confidence here is moderate because while some activities are suspicious, they might not be conclusive without more context. But given the combination of events, it's worth flagging as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include temporary file creation\/deletion (possible script obfuscation), registry modifications, and repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events, which may indicate suspicious activity or attempted cleanup after execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. Events like Image loaded for clrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, clrjit.dll is part of the .NET runtime, so that's normal. But MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. Maybe that's okay, but I should note that. Then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack, like dropping a payload and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event, which isn't too suspicious on its own. Then several Registry value set events for powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Chrome having multiple registry changes might be normal if it's updating settings, but if it's too frequent, that could be an issue. However, the majority of these are from powershell.exe. \n\nLooking further, there's a command line entry for powershell.exe with \"& {}\" which is an empty script. That might be a sign of obfuscation or a placeholder. Then, another event where a file is being removed from the Temp directory, which was created earlier. That seems like part of a script that's trying to clean up after itself, which is common in malicious activities.\n\nThere's also a Process accessed event, which could be normal, but combined with other events might indicate something. The whoami.exe process is legitimate, but it's being run via powershell, which might be part of a larger sequence of commands. The line \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip\" suggests that the script is trying to delete a zip file from the Temp folder. If that zip file was previously extracted or used, this could be part of an attack.\n\nThe multiple Image loaded events for .NET DLLs are normal, but the combination of file creation and deletion, along with registry changes and process access, might indicate that PowerShell is being used for something beyond normal operations. The fact that the same Temp file is created and deleted could be an attempt to execute a script and then remove evidence.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and Windows Defender's DLLs being loaded is normal. But the pattern of creating a file, then deleting it, along with registry changes and process access, does raise suspicion. The confidence here is moderate because while some events are normal, the combination might indicate a potential security incident. I need to check if there's a clear malicious pattern. Since the user is asking for a classification, the presence of these suspicious activities without clear benign context might lean towards \"interesting\" for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of normal system activity and potential suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns Observed:**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion:**\n   - A file (`objeto_principal.zip`) is created in the Temp directory (`$env:TEMP`) and then deleted (`Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip`). This pattern is commonly associated with malware or malicious scripts attempting to execute payloads and erase evidence.\n\n2. **PowerShell Command-Line Activity:**\n   - The command `& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}` suggests an attempt to delete a file, possibly after extracting or executing it. The use of `-ErrorAction Ignore` indicates the script is designed to suppress errors, which is often seen in malicious contexts.\n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe` could indicate tampering with system settings or persistence mechanisms, though this requires correlation with other logs for confirmation.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Access:**\n   - Frequent `Process accessed` events for `powershell.exe` may signal attempts to manipulate or monitor processes, which could be benign (e.g., scripting) but merits scrutiny in isolation.\n\n### **Normal Activity:**\n- **.NET DLL Loads:** Events involving `clrjit.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, and `clr.dll` are standard for .NET applications and PowerShell execution.\n- **Windows Defender DLLs:** Loading `MpOAV.dll` is part of Windows Defender's operation and is expected.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe combination of **file creation\/deletion**, **PowerShell activity**, and **registry changes** raises **moderate suspicion** of potential malicious behavior (e.g., lateral movement, payload cleanup). While some events are benign, the pattern warrants **further investigation** to rule out adversarial activity.\n\n**Confidence Level:** Moderate (50-70%) – The behavior is not definitively malicious but is inconsistent with typical user or system activity."}

Let me check the tasks associated with PowerShell. There are several entries where PowerShell is creating and deleting files in the Temp directory. For example, File created and then immediately deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. That might be normal, but repeated deletions of various .zip and .txt files in the Temp folder could indicate someone trying to clean up after executing scripts. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of 'Remove-Item' commands in the command_line fields. These commands are deleting files in the TEMP directory. While deleting temporary files isn't unusual, the sheer number of such events might be suspicious. It could be part of a script that's downloading and executing payloads, then cleaning up.\n\nAnother thing is the Image loaded events for mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll. The first one is a .NET assembly, which is normal. MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's also legitimate. However, if these were from unexpected locations, that might be a problem, but the paths here seem standard.\n\nThere's also a Chrome.exe event with a Registry value set. That might be benign, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it's worth noting. The presence of 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell could indicate that another process is interacting with it, which might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nHowever, I don't see any clear signs of malware or unauthorized access. The activities seem to be within normal operations, even though the volume of events is high. The key here is that the user is asking if this is interesting. Since there's a pattern of creating and deleting files in Temp directories via PowerShell, which can be used for malicious purposes, this might warrant further investigation. But without more context, like other indicators of compromise or unusual network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.6.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to consider the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them involve 'powershell.exe' with various tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDelete. There are several instances where PowerShell is loading .dll files, some of which are related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender, which might be normal. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting files quickly might be part of an attack to avoid leaving traces.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are a few 'Remove-Item' commands in the Temp directory. Those commands are trying to delete files named things like 'registro_auxiliar.txt' and others. The use of '-Force' and '-ErrorAction Ignore' suggests the attacker is trying to ensure the files are deleted without errors, which is suspicious. \n\nAlso, there's a 'whoami.exe' process, which is normal, but the main concern is the PowerShell activities. The fact that multiple files are being created and deleted in the Temp folder might indicate some kind of script execution or payload delivery. However, the events also include normal activities like ImageLoad for legitimate system files (like mscoree.dll, clr.dll), which are part of the .NET runtime. \n\nBut the combination of creating temporary files and then deleting them, along with multiple registry changes and process accesses, might indicate something malicious. However, I should check if there are any other signs. The presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory might be part of a legitimate log collection process, but not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. The key point here is that the PowerShell process is performing several actions that could be part of an attack chain. However, some of these actions might be benign. For example, creating and deleting temporary files could be part of a script that's being tested or run normally. But the repetition of such actions, especially with the same naming patterns, might indicate automated or malicious behavior.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the events include both legitimate system processes (like loading .dlls from System32 and .NET directories) and potential suspicious activities (like creating and deleting files in Temp). However, without more context, such as the presence of other malicious indicators (like network connections, unexpected command-line arguments, or unusual registry modifications), it's a bit tricky.\n\nConsidering all that, the presence of multiple file creation and deletion events in the Temp directory, along with registry changes and process accesses, could be a sign of something malicious. However, it's not definitive. The answer might lean towards being interesting for investigation because the pattern of activities could be indicative of an attack, but there's not enough evidence to confirm it's malicious without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves a mix of **normal system activities** and **potentially suspicious behavior**, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Folder:**  \n     Multiple entries show PowerShell creating files in the `Temp` directory (e.g., `registro_auxiliar.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`) and immediately deleting them using `Remove-Item` with `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore`. This pattern is **common in malicious scripts** to evade detection by cleaning up traces.\n   - **Registry Modifications:**  \n     PowerShell is modifying registry values (`RegistryEvent`), which could indicate attempts to **persist access** or alter system behavior.\n\n2. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - **.NET and Defender DLL Loads:**  \n     Loading `.dll` files from legitimate paths (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `Windows Defender`) is **normal** for .NET applications and system tools.\n   - **`whoami.exe` Execution:**  \n     This is a standard utility for checking user identity and is not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **Chrome Activity:**  \n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for `chrome.exe` are likely **benign** (e.g., browser extensions or settings updates).\n\n4. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**  \n   - The `winlogbeat.exe` process creating a file in the `Downloads` directory is **normal** for log collection tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Red Flags:**\n- **File Creation + Immediate Deletion:**  \n  The repeated pattern of creating and deleting temporary files in the `Temp` directory is **suspicious** and could indicate **script-based attacks**, **payload delivery**, or **data exfiltration**.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:**  \n  The deleted files (e.g., `registro_auxiliar.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`) have generic names, which is common in **malware** to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **some events are legitimate**, the **combination of PowerShell activity** (file creation\/deletion, registry changes) and **lack of context** (e.g., no clear benign purpose) makes this batch **interesting for further investigation**. It could indicate **malicious behavior**, but additional analysis (e.g., network traffic, process tree, file content) is needed to confirm. \n\n**Classification:** **Suspicious – Requires Further Analysis**."}

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe with registry value set events. Those might be normal, like browser updates or settings changes. But then there's a lot of PowerShell and whoami.exe processes. Whoami.exe is typically used to get the current user's identity, which isn't inherently malicious, but if it's being called repeatedly, that could be a sign of something. However, looking at the command lines, they all seem to be the standard path for whoami.exe, so maybe that's just normal activity.\n\nThe PowerShell entries have \"Process accessed\" events. Accessing a process isn't necessarily bad, but if it's done multiple times, maybe there's something going on. However, without more context like arguments or unusual behavior, it's hard to tell.

Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation when setting up.
