The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe doing registry value sets. Those are common system processes, so maybe normal. But then there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but sometimes malware uses similar names. However, just loading a legitimate DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file there might be normal, especially if it's part of setup. But the filename is .yml.new, which could be a temporary file during configuration. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's a red flag. Using wmic to delete processes can be part of a malicious activity, like terminating processes to avoid detection. Also, the command line is obfuscated with \/c and redirection, which is common in attacks.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, but if an attacker is trying to bypass it, that could be an issue. However, just loading these DLLs might not be suspicious unless there's something else.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe and process access events. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but without specific commands or suspicious activities, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the wmic command, it might indicate someone trying to manipulate processes.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry value sets by svchost.exe and chrome.exe could be normal, but if they're modifying critical registry keys, that's a problem. However, the logs don't specify which keys, so it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the cmd.exe command using wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's a clear indicator of potential malicious activity. Also, the WMIC.exe loading certain DLLs might be part of an attempt to interact with security software.

There's a lot of chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and some others like whoami.exe and schtasks.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the command line in one of the cmd.exe entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like someone is replacing the sethc.exe file, which is a known technique used in attacks, like the \"DLL hijacking\" or replacing system files. The sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys executable, and replacing it with a backup file might be part of a malicious payload.\n\nAnother event is the use of schtasks.exe with the command to delete a task named \"win32times\". That could be an attempt to remove a scheduled task that might be part of a defense mechanism or a legitimate task. Also, the image loaded event for taskschd.dll might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere's also a lot of Process accessed events for powershell.exe, which is common in attacks for executing commands. However, just having those events isn't necessarily malicious unless they're doing something unusual. The registry events are frequent, but again, without more context, they might be normal.\n\nThe key suspicious activity here is the replacement of sethc.exe. That's a red flag. Even though there are other events, that single action is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Also, the repeated use of powershell and cmd might be part of the attack's execution phase.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of the sethc.exe replacement suggests a possible attack, making this batch interesting for investigation.

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the combination of all events, not individual ones.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Events like 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded' are common in both normal operations and attacks. But I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the 'file' entries, there's a 'File created' and then 'File Delete logged' for a temporary script file. That might be part of a normal process, like a script being run and then cleaned up. However, the paths involved, like AppData\\Local\\Temp, are common places for malware to store temporary files. The fact that the file is deleted afterward could be an attempt to hide evidence.\n\nAnother point is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with 'powershell.exe & {}'. These might be part of the PowerShell execution policy testing or some automated process, but without more context, it's hard to say. The 'Image loaded' events reference system files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. Loading these is normal, but if there's any unusual activity around them, that could be a problem.\n\nThere's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of a legitimate monitoring setup. However, if this is unexpected in the environment, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch has multiple PowerShell activities, file creation and deletion in temp directories, and some registry changes. While some of these are normal, the combination might indicate a script being executed and cleaned up, which could be part of a malicious action. However, without more context or specific indicators of compromise (like unusual commands or unexpected network activity), it's a bit ambiguous.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking through the events. There's a lot of PowerShell activity here. Let me check each entry.\n\nThe first event is about 'Image loaded' for 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe normal. But then there's a 'File created' event in the user's AppData folder. The filename is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Hmm, creating files in AppData could be normal, but sometimes attackers use that for persistence.\n\nNext, several 'Registry value set' events. Registry changes can be suspicious, especially if they're modifying keys related to startup or execution policies. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Then there's a 'Process accessed' event, which might indicate someone trying to manipulate another process.\n\nLooking at the command lines for PowerShell, there are multiple instances where they're checking if certain .bat files exist. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" – the '..' suggests they're navigating up directories, which might be a way to obfuscate the actual path. This could be part of a script that's trying to locate a file, maybe to execute it if found. But why so many different paths? It might be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Image loaded' events for .dll files related to .NET Framework. That's normal for PowerShell, but the repetition might not be. However, the presence of 'mscoree.dll' and 'clr.dll' are standard for .NET execution, so maybe not suspicious on their own.\n\nAnother thing is the 'Provider Lifecycle' events. Those might relate to PowerShell providers, which are used for interacting with different data stores. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThe 'File created' in the Temp directory with a .ps1 file. That's a PowerShell script. Creating a script in Temp could be part of a payload, but again, it depends on the content. Since we don't have the script's content here, just the filename, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nNow, considering all these events, the main points are the multiple PowerShell activities, the registry changes, the file creations in user directories and Temp, and the obfuscated paths in the command lines. These could indicate an attacker trying to execute scripts, modify registry settings for persistence, or evade detection. However, some of these activities could be part of legitimate administrative tasks or software installations.\n\nBut given that there's a combination of file creation, registry modification, and PowerShell script checks with obfuscated paths, this might be a sign of a potential security incident. The fact that the same user (fiddelis) is involved in these activities might be relevant if that user is a regular user and not an admin. However, without more context on user roles or the environment, it's a bit tricky.\n\nIn conclusion, while some events are normal, the combination of multiple suspicious activities like registry changes, file creation in sensitive locations, and obfuscated paths in PowerShell commands could warrant further investigation. Therefore, this might be considered interesting for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system behavior and potentially suspicious activities, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns and Red Flags:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting with Obfuscated Paths:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `Test-Path` with paths containing `..` (e.g., `C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat`). This obfuscation may hide the actual target path, commonly used in attacks to evade detection or bypass restrictions.\n\n2. **File Creation in Sensitive Locations:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) is created in the **Temp directory**. While temporary files are common, the lack of context (e.g., no logs of script execution) raises concerns about potential malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple **Registry value set** events (e.g., `RegistryEvent`) are logged. Unusual registry changes, especially if tied to execution policies, startup entries, or user permissions, could indicate attempts to modify system behavior or enable persistence.\n\n4. **Unusual DLL Loads:**\n   - While loading `.dll` files like `mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll` is normal for .NET execution, the **repetition** of `ImageLoad` events for these files might suggest anomalous behavior (e.g., injection or tampering).\n\n5. **User-Specific Activity:**\n   - All events are tied to the user **`fiddelis`**. If this user is a **non-administrator**, the combination of registry changes, file creation, and PowerShell execution could indicate **privilege escalation** or **malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Contexts:**\n- **`MpClient.dll`** (Windows Defender) and **.NET Framework DLLs** are legitimate system components.\n- **`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`** in AppData might relate to PowerShell execution policies or user-specific configurations.\n- **Provider Lifecycle events** are standard for PowerShell interactions with data stores (e.g., file systems, registry).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - Analyze the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1` and other created files to determine if they contain malicious code.\n   - Check for signs of **script obfuscation**, **remote execution**, or **credential theft**.\n\n2. **Audit Registry Changes:**\n   - Review modified registry keys (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RunMRU`) for unauthorized modifications or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Monitor User Activity:**\n   - Confirm if **`fiddelis`** has legitimate administrative privileges. If not, investigate why they are executing scripts, modifying the registry, and creating files in system directories.\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement:**\n   - Look for **network activity** or **process injections** that might indicate the attacker is moving laterally within the network.\n\n5. **Enable Logging and Alerts:**\n   - Implement **SIEM rules** to flag obfuscated paths, unexpected PowerShell execution, or registry changes in high-risk keys.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities are benign, the **combination of obfuscated PowerShell commands, registry modifications, and file creation in sensitive locations** suggests a potential **security incident**. Further investigation is required to determine if this is a **legitimate administrative task** or **malicious activity**."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is deleting a file in the Temp directory. That's a common place for temporary files, so maybe not too suspicious on its own. But then there's a file creation in Downloads, which is normal too. \n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of them, but since they're all from chrome, maybe that's just normal behavior. Unless there's something unusual in the registry keys, but the logs don't specify which ones. \n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process checking if certain batch files exist. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, \"C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\" – the use of \"..\" might be trying to navigate up directories, but not sure if that's malicious. However, creating files in various directories like \"modulo_secundario\" and \"modulo_padrao\" could be part of setting up some scripts. \n\nThen there are image loads from PowerShell, like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But the presence of multiple image loads might be part of normal operations. \n\nWait, there's an entry where PowerShell is creating a new item and setting content to a batch file. The command line shows New-Item and Set-Content with the value \"dir\". That seems benign, but maybe it's part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe repeated registry events from chrome might be normal, but if they're all the same, maybe not. However, the logs don't show any specific registry keys being modified. \n\nThe main thing I notice is the multiple PowerShell activities involving file creation and checking paths. While some of these could be part of legitimate scripts, the combination of file creation, checking for existence, and modifying registry values might indicate something. But I don't see any obvious malicious activities like downloading files from the internet, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive areas. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. There's enough activity that's not entirely normal, but nothing jumping out as clearly malicious. So maybe \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. But I need to check again. \n\nWait, the file paths have some strange directory structures. For example, \"modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\" – using \"..\" to go up a directory and then into another. That might be a red flag if it's trying to access parent directories in a way that's not typical. However, in PowerShell scripts, that's a common way to navigate. \n\nAlso, the fact that PowerShell is creating batch files and modifying them could be part of a setup, but without seeing the actual content of those files, it's hard to say. \n\nOverall, while there are some unusual activities, they might not be malicious. But since there's enough to warrant further investigation, I think labeling it as \"INTERESTING\" is appropriate. The confidence is around 0.6 because it's not definitive, but there are enough indicators that could be part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several activities that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious behavior is evident. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell File Manipulation:**\n   - **File Creation\/Modification:** PowerShell processes create and modify batch files in non-standard directories (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_secundario`). While this could be part of legitimate scripts, the use of paths with `..` (e.g., `modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\pacote_temporario`) raises questions about intentional directory traversal or obfuscation.\n   - **Command Execution:** A PowerShell process runs `New-Item` and `Set-Content` to write `dir` to a batch file. This is benign in isolation but could be a precursor to more complex operations if combined with other activities.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple entries show `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` modifying registry values. While Chrome's registry access is typical, the lack of specific key details (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\...`) makes it hard to assess legitimacy. Repeated modifications by PowerShell might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Image Loads:**\n   - PowerShell loads legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). These are expected for .NET operations and antivirus integration, so no immediate threat here.\n\n4. **File Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A PowerShell process deletes a file in the Temp directory (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`). This is common for temporary cleanup but could mask other activities if the file was malicious.\n\n### **Indicators of Interest:**\n- **Unusual Directory Structures:** The use of `..` in file paths may indicate obfuscation or attempts to access parent directories, which could be a red flag if tied to malicious payloads.\n- **Lack of Context:** The absence of details about registry keys, network activity, or user interaction makes it challenging to confirm benign intent.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **moderate suspicious activity** that could be part of legitimate operations or early stages of an attack. Further investigation (e.g., correlating with network logs, inspecting file contents, or analyzing registry changes) is needed to determine if this is benign or malicious.\n\n**Classification:** `INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence:** `0.6` (moderate) – Not conclusive but warrants deeper analysis."}

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each of the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell commands. The command lines are creating new items and setting content in various paths. The paths have a pattern with directories like \"registro_geral\", \"componente_ativo\", and so on, followed by \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. Then they're creating batch files and writing \"dir\" into them. That seems suspicious because creating files in parent directories might be an attempt to write to locations that aren't immediately obvious, possibly to hide the files or evade detection.\n\nNext, there are events where files are created and then deleted, like the temporary file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest...\" which is created and then deleted. That could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily. Also, there's a file created in \"C:\\componente_geral...\" which might be a legitimate file, but combined with other events, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there are registry value set events and image loaded events, which are normal for PowerShell, but the combination with the file operations might indicate something. The repeated use of \"New-Item\" with Force and then \"Set-Content\" could be part of a script that's trying to create and modify files in a way that's not standard.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern of malicious activity. For example, creating batch files with \"dir\" might be a test or a way to execute commands later. The use of \"..\\\" in the paths could be an attempt to navigate up the directory tree, which is common in attacks to reach sensitive areas. Also, the presence of multiple file creations and deletions might be part of a larger operation, like cleaning up after an attack.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating temporary files is normal. But the frequency and the specific paths might be red flags. The fact that multiple files are being created in different directories with similar patterns might suggest an automated script or attack.\n\nAnother point is the image loaded events. Loading .NET DLLs is normal for PowerShell, but if there's any unusual behavior here, it might be a sign of something malicious. However, the entries here don't show any suspicious DLLs.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated creation of files with PowerShell, using directory traversal, and the presence of temporary files being created and deleted might indicate a potential security threat. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But given the patterns observed, it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event log exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicious Behavior**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Usage with File Manipulation**:\n   - Multiple entries involve PowerShell executing commands like `New-Item` and `Set-Content` to **create and modify files** in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base\\..`).\n   - The use of `..` (directory traversal) in file paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base\\..`) suggests an attempt to **write to parent directories**, potentially to evade detection or access restricted areas.\n\n2. **Creation and Deletion of Temporary Files**:\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is **created and deleted**, which could indicate **script obfuscation** or **cleanup after an operation** (e.g., dropping payloads).\n\n3. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - A file (`objeto_comum_script.bat`) is created in `C:\\componente_geral\\...`, which may be a **malicious payload** or a **backdoor** if not part of legitimate software.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Activity**:\n   - Registry value changes and process access events (e.g., `ProcessAccess`, `ImageLoad`) are logged, which are **normal for PowerShell** but could signal **tampering with system settings** or **loading malicious modules** (though no suspicious DLLs are explicitly listed here).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The file creation and registry changes could be part of an attempt to **establish persistence** on the system.\n- **Command-and-Control (C2) Communication**: The batch files (`dir` command) might be **stubs for future malicious activity** (e.g., downloading payloads).\n- **Evasion Techniques**: The use of directory traversal and temporary files may be an attempt to **evade logging or detection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network traffic** (e.g., outbound connections to C2 servers) or **unusual process behavior** (e.g., execution of `objeto_comum_script.bat`).\n   - Investigate the **origin of the PowerShell scripts** (e.g., user accounts, source files).\n\n2. **Analyze the Created Files**:\n   - Inspect the contents of `objeto_comum_script.bat` and other files to determine if they contain **malicious commands** or **payloads**.\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for **additional compromised systems** or **unauthorized access** via the created files.\n\n4. **Implement Mitigations**:\n   - Restrict **PowerShell usage** where unnecessary.\n   - Monitor **file system changes** and **registry modifications** for suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., PowerShell usage, temporary file creation) is common, the **repeated file manipulation, directory traversal, and lack of clear legitimacy** in the created files strongly suggest **potential malicious activity**. This log should be flagged for **further forensic analysis** and **incident response**. \n\n**Classification**: High Priority – Potential Security Incident."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. Each entry has a command line that checks if a specific batch file exists and exits with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned are a mix of logical and physical directories, but some of them look a bit odd. For example, paths like \"C:\\\\objeto_logico\\\\elemento_logico\\\\..\\\\elemento_base\\\\pacote_temporario_script.bat\" have multiple levels with terms like \"objeto_logico\" and \"elemento_logico,\" which might be placeholders or obfuscated names. That's suspicious because attackers often use obfuscation to hide their activities.\n\nThen there are entries related to file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. For instance, a file is created at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1\" and then deleted. That's a common tactic for malware to execute scripts temporarily and then clean up traces. Also, the presence of \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" in the filename might be a red flag, as it could indicate testing or malicious script execution.\n\nThere's also a mention of \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, but if it's creating files in unusual locations or with unexpected names, that could be a sign of something wrong. However, in this case, the file is named \".winlogbeat.yml.new,\" which seems like a normal configuration file. Not sure if that's significant yet.\n\nAnother point is the multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. PowerShell scripts that check for the existence of files and exit based on that might be part of a larger script or setup. If these checks are part of a legitimate process, they might be harmless, but when combined with other suspicious activities like file creation\/deletion and obfuscated paths, it raises concerns.\n\nAlso, the logs include events like \"Image loaded\" for Defender DLLs, which is normal, but the combination with other events might not be directly related. The \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" events could be part of normal operations, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific files with obfuscated paths, temporary file creation and deletion, and the use of terms that might be placeholders or obfuscated names all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some components are legitimate (like Winlogbeat), the overall pattern suggests that this might be worth investigating further. The key indicators are the suspicious file paths and the temporary script handling, which are common in malware campaigns.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Obfuscated File Paths in PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands check for the existence of files with paths like:\n     - `C:\\objeto_logico\\elemento_logico\\..\\elemento_base\\pacote_temporario_script.bat`\n     - `C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\estrutura_secundario\\bin\\entrada_base.exe`\n   - These paths use non-standard, obfuscated terms (e.g., `objeto_logico`, `elemento_base`) and nested directory structures, which are **common in obfuscation techniques** to evade detection.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A PowerShell script creates a temporary file in the user's `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory:\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1`\n   - The file is later deleted, which is **consistent with malware behavior** to execute scripts temporarily and avoid leaving traces.\n\n3. **Unusual File Naming**:\n   - The temporary file name `__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1` includes a `PSScriptPolicyTest` prefix, which could indicate **testing or malicious script execution** (e.g., probing for vulnerabilities or executing payloads).\n\n4. **Repetitive \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - The PowerShell commands repeatedly check for files with similar structures, suggesting **automated or scripted behavior** that may be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., checking for prerequisites before executing a payload).\n\n5. **Legitimate Tools in Unusual Contexts**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in the `Downloads` directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is **not inherently malicious**, but the context (combined with other suspicious events) raises questions about whether the tool is being misused.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Potential Threats**\n- **Obfuscation and Evasion**: The use of non-standard paths and temporary file creation\/deletion suggests an attempt to **avoid detection by security tools**.\n- **Script Execution in Temp Folders**: Temporary files in `AppData\\Local\\Temp` are often used by **malware to execute payloads** without leaving persistent traces.\n- **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the repetitive and obfuscated nature of these commands could indicate **script-based attacks** (e.g., credential harvesting, lateral movement).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for additional events (e.g., network connections, registry changes, or process injections) that may link these PowerShell activities to a larger attack.\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Retrieve and inspect the deleted temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1`) if possible (e.g., via forensic tools or backups).\n3. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate if the `entrada_base.exe` or `estrutura_base.exe` files (mentioned in the paths) are legitimate or part of a malicious payload.\n4. **Check for Exploits**:\n   - Look for signs of exploit attempts (e.g., unusual process behaviors, memory dumps, or unexpected service creation).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some events (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe` activity) are legitimate, the **combination of obfuscated paths, temporary script execution, and repetitive PowerShell commands** strongly suggests **potential malicious activity**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a false positive, a benign script, or part of a security incident."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist, like testing paths for executables. For example, the first event has a command line that checks if \"tarefa_ativo.exe\" exists and exits with 0 or 1. This kind of behavior might be part of a script that's checking for the presence of a file, which isn't inherently malicious, but when combined with other events, it could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are events related to file creation and deletion. One entry shows a file being created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, but it can also be used to hide malicious activities. The file path is in the user's AppData folder, which is a common place for temporary files, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be worth noting.\n\nThere are also image load events, which reference system files like mscoree.dll and MpClient.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, if there were any unexpected or unknown DLLs loaded, that would be a concern. But in this case, the DLLs mentioned are part of the Windows operating system and Defender, so that seems okay.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of \"whoami.exe\" and \"cmd.exe\" in some events. The whoami command is often used in benign scripts to get user information, but combined with other commands, it could be part of a larger malicious operation. However, on its own, it's not suspicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are entries like \"Process Create,\" \"Registry value set,\" and \"Image loaded.\" These are typical system events, but the frequency of PowerShell-related activities might be higher than usual. However, without a baseline, it's hard to say if that's abnormal.\n\nThe key points here are the multiple PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of specific files and the temporary file creation\/deletion. These could be part of a legitimate script, but they might also be part of a technique used by malware to check for the presence of other malicious components or to execute code in a way that's harder to detect. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, like downloading payloads, connecting to external servers, or modifying system settings.\n\nConsidering all that, the logs don't show clear signs of a security threat, but the patterns observed (repeated PowerShell commands, temporary file operations) might warrant further investigation. It's a bit on the edge, so I'd lean towards \"interesting\" but not necessarily malicious. The answer should reflect that there's no conclusive evidence of a threat, but the activities are noteworthy and could be part of something more significant.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a series of system events primarily involving **PowerShell.exe** and **cmd.exe**, with a focus on file existence checks, temporary file operations, and registry modifications. Here's a structured analysis of the findings:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Activity**:\n   - Multiple entries involve PowerShell executing commands to check the existence of files (e.g., `IF EXIST %%temp%%\\objeto_logico.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`). These are typical of scripts that may be testing for the presence of files or triggering conditional logic.\n   - **No direct evidence of malicious payloads** (e.g., downloading files, executing obfuscated code, or network communication).\n\n2. **Temporary File Operations**:\n   - A file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in the user's AppData directory. Temporary files are common in legitimate workflows, but their creation\/deletion could be used to evade detection in malicious contexts. **No evidence of suspicious content** is present.\n\n3. **System Legitimate Processes**:\n   - **`whoami.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** are used for basic system tasks (e.g., retrieving user context). These are standard tools and not inherently malicious.\n   - **Image load events** reference legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `MpClient.dll`), which are part of Windows and Microsoft Defender. No anomalies here.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Several entries involve **registry value sets**, but no specific registry keys or values are flagged as suspicious. These could be part of normal application behavior or configuration changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Repetition of PowerShell Commands**: The frequent use of PowerShell for file checks and registry modifications could indicate **script-based automation** or **legitimate administrative tasks**. However, in some contexts, this pattern is also used by malware (e.g., for persistence or lateral movement).\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional data (e.g., network activity, process tree, or file content analysis), it is **challenging to confirm malicious intent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not contain direct evidence of a security threat**, but the observed patterns (e.g., PowerShell scripting, temporary file operations) are **notable and could warrant further investigation**, especially if:\n- The system is part of a critical infrastructure or sensitive environment.\n- There is a lack of documented administrative activity.\n- Correlated logs (e.g., network traffic, file hashes) suggest malicious behavior.\n\n**Classification**: **Interesting for further analysis**, but **not conclusive of a threat** at this stage."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple instances of \"Process accessed\" and \"Process Create\" for PowerShell. But what stands out is the command line in one of the entries. The command line is checking if a specific file exists and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that. The file paths mentioned are like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar...\" and others. These paths look a bit suspicious because they have a lot of directories with names that seem to be in Portuguese or maybe some obfuscation. Also, the use of Test-Path in PowerShell scripts is often used in malicious scripts to check for the presence of files or directories, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother thing I see is the loading of certain DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are related to .NET runtime, which is normal, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it might indicate something. Also, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The file name is __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be a legitimate test, but the creation and deletion quickly could be suspicious.\n\nThe use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might be related to PowerShell's execution policies or modules being loaded. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the repetition of similar commands checking different file paths might be part of a script that's trying to locate specific files, which could be part of a payload or checking for prerequisites.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple \"Process accessed\" events could indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which isn't typical in normal operations. The combination of these factors—repeated PowerShell activity, checking for specific files, creating and deleting temp files, and loading certain DLLs—makes me think this might be a legitimate script, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nI should also consider that some of these events could be part of a script that's trying to bypass security measures, especially with the Temp file creation. The confidence level isn't extremely high, but there are enough indicators to suggest that this is worth looking into more deeply. So, I'd say it's interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity or at least a need for closer scrutiny. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion:**\n1. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Repetitive Use of `Test-Path`:** Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files in non-standard, obfuscated directories (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...`, `C:\\tarefa_padrao\\...`). This could indicate a script probing for specific files (e.g., payloads, configuration files) or testing for the presence of a compromised system.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:** A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This is a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence of malicious scripts.\n\n2. **Unusual DLL Loading:**\n   - **Windows Defender DLL (`MpOAV.dll`):** The loading of `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender) could be legitimate, but combined with PowerShell activity, it raises questions about potential evasion techniques or interaction with security software.\n\n3. **Suspicious File Paths:**\n   - The directories referenced (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_temporario\\...`, `C:\\unidade_base\\...`) use non-English terms (possibly Portuguese) and lack standard naming conventions. This could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to mask malicious intent.\n\n4. **Event Types:**\n   - **\"Pipe Created\" and \"File Delete logged\":** These events are uncommon in typical user activity and may suggest communication between processes or cleanup of temporary files to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Context:**\n- **Legitimate Scenarios:** \n  - PowerShell scripts are often used for system administration, and `Test-Path` is a standard cmdlet. Temporary files are common in script execution.\n  - The loading of `MpOAV.dll` could be part of a legitimate security check.\n- **Malicious Indicators:**\n  - The repetitive use of `Test-Path` across multiple obfuscated paths suggests a script probing for specific conditions (e.g., presence of a backdoor, exfiltration targets, or other malicious files).\n  - The creation and deletion of a temporary script file may indicate an attempt to execute a script without leaving persistent evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional events (e.g., network activity, process injections, registry changes) that might tie these PowerShell commands to a broader attack.\n- **Analyze the Script Content:** If the temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) can be recovered, analyze its contents to determine its purpose.\n- **Monitor User Behavior:** Investigate the user (`fiddelis`) for other anomalous activity, such as privilege escalation or access to sensitive resources.\n- **Check for Obfuscation:** The use of non-English directory names and repeated `Test-Path` commands may indicate obfuscation techniques used to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity may be legitimate, the combination of **unusual PowerShell usage**, **suspicious file paths**, and **temporary file manipulation** raises significant red flags. This warrants **further investigation** to rule out malicious intent or compromise. **Confidence Level:** Moderate (60–70%), as the activity is not definitively malicious but exhibits enough anomalies to require deeper analysis."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender is a trusted component. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData folder. Not sure yet, maybe a temporary file?\n\nNext, there are several registry value set and process accessed events. Those could be normal, but combined with other activities might be a red flag. The whoami.exe process is run, which is a standard tool for checking user identity. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a bunch of PowerShell commands checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The filenames are similar, all looking for a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That's a common name for malicious scripts that capture keystrokes. The fact that they're checking multiple paths might indicate an attempt to locate a malicious script.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all use Test-Path to check if the script exists and then exit with 0 or 1. If the script isn't found, they exit 1. This could be part of a larger attack where the attacker is trying to execute the script if it's present. The paths mentioned are in temporary or user-specific directories, which might be where the attacker is hiding the malicious script.\n\nThen there are image loaded events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, so loading them in PowerShell is normal, especially if the script is using .NET features. However, the combination with the previous events might be a sign of something more.\n\nAlso, a file is created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. The name includes \"ScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be a legitimate test, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly could be suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell processes checking for a keystroke-logging script, creating and deleting temporary files, loading .NET components. While some of these actions are normal, the pattern of checking for a specific malicious script and the temporary file handling raises concerns. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch of logs is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential **malicious activity** or **attempts to execute payloads**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n\n1. **Repeated Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - **10+ PowerShell processes** are observed using `Test-Path` to check for the existence of a script named `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in various paths (e.g., `C:\\unidade_temporario\\...`, `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`).\n   - **Implication**: This is a **common tactic** in malware to locate and execute a keystroke-logging script, which could exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credentials).\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion:**\n   - A temporary file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` is **created and deleted** within the same log entry (`FileCreate` followed by `FileDelete`).\n   - **Implication**: This behavior is often used to **avoid detection** by minimizing forensic traces.\n\n3. **Unusual Image Loads:**\n   - PowerShell loads **unusual DLLs** like `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, and `clr.dll` (part of the .NET runtime). While these are legitimate, their loading in conjunction with the above activities may indicate **script execution** or **payload injection**.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryValueSet` events are logged. While not inherently malicious, they may indicate **attempts to modify system behavior** or **escalate privileges**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Context:**\n- **Legitimate**: \n  - Windows Defender DLLs (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are loaded, which is normal.\n  - `whoami.exe` is a standard tool for checking user identity.\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - The repeated checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` and the temporary file handling **strongly suggest** an attempt to execute or hide malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs is **highly suspicious** and **requires further investigation**. The patterns align with **malware behavior** (e.g., keystroke logging, file obfuscation). Immediate actions could include:\n- **Analyzing the deleted temporary file** (if possible via timeline analysis).\n- **Checking for the presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** in the system.\n- **Reviewing PowerShell execution policies** and **script execution history**.\n- **Correlating with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to confirm malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate further using forensic tools and threat intelligence to confirm if this is a **false positive** or **actual compromise**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell. The first event mentions a pipe created, which might be normal, but then there are PowerShell commands checking for the existence of a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths. The paths mentioned are \"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\\\unidade_logico...\". The fact that they're checking if a specific script exists could be a red flag. Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is often associated with malicious activity, like keyloggers.\n\nThen there are entries about winlogbeat creating files, which might be part of normal logging, but not necessarily suspicious. However, the repeated PowerShell events with Process accessed and Registry value set could indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. Also, the presence of whoami.exe is normal, but the multiple instances of chrome.exe making network connections and DNS queries might be benign if it's just regular browsing. However, if there's a lot of DNS queries to suspicious domains, that's a problem. But in the logs provided, the domains aren't specified, so that's unclear.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple attempts to check for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. If the script isn't present, the process exits with 1, which might be part of an installation or check. However, the name of the script is concerning. Even if it's a legitimate script, the name is very specific and could be a sign of someone trying to plant a keylogger.\n\nAlso, there are several events where PowerShell is accessing processes and the registry. This could be part of a larger attack where the attacker is trying to modify system settings or inject code. The ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll are normal, as that's a standard Windows component, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the PowerShell commands checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and the multiple Process accessed events. Even though some activities are normal, the combination of these specific script names and the repeated access to processes and registry might indicate a potential security threat. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the presence of the script name and the PowerShell activity raises enough flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes check for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts in non-standard paths, which is highly suspicious.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look for any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the commands. One entry has a command line with \"ls -recurse\", \"get-childitem -recurse\", and \"gci -recurse\". These are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. While that's normal, the repetition might be a red flag. Maybe it's part of a script that's trying to gather information.\n\nThen there are several \"Image loaded\" events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's part of the .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell. But there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be related to antivirus operations, but I'm not sure if that's suspicious here.\n\nThere's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The file name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be a legitimate script, but the deletion could be a sign of trying to clean up after an operation.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory might be related to log collection, but the filename has a .yml.new extension, which could be part of a configuration change. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nAlso, the user has multiple entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These are part of PowerShell's internal processes, but if they're occurring in large numbers or at unusual times, it could indicate something's wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious points are the repeated PowerShell commands, the creation and deletion of a temporary file, and the loading of various DLLs.
