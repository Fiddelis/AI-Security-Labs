That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I need to check more.\n\nThen there's mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE modifying registry values. That's not unusual on its own, but combined with other events? Not sure yet.\n\nLots of PowerShell processes are running. The command lines show PowerShell being executed, and several image loads related to .NET and Windows Defender. That's common, but maybe too many?\n\nWait, there's a file created in the Temp directory called __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1, then immediately deleted. That could be a red flag. Why create and delete a script so quickly? Maybe testing or malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there's a test.ps1 file created in Downloads, and then PowerShell is run with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass to execute that script. Bypassing execution policy is often a sign of something trying to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked. That seems suspicious.\n\nMultiple entries for Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle might be normal, but combined with the script execution and the file creation\/deletion, it's concerning. The user might be running a script that's trying to evade detection by creating and deleting files quickly.\n\nThe repetition of events, like multiple FileCreate for the same .yml.new file, might indicate some setup or configuration, but not necessarily malicious. However, the combination with the PowerShell script execution and bypassing policies is a higher risk.\n\nSo, the key points are the PowerShell script execution with bypass, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple registry changes. These could indicate an attempted attack or malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and suspicious registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe accessed, with a ProcessAccess rule. Not too suspicious on its own. Then, several ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some .NET Framework files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a security-related DLL, so maybe something's trying to interact with the antivirus? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Then, immediately after, a FileDeleteDetected for the same file. Creating and deleting a script quickly could be part of a normal operation, like a temporary script execution. But sometimes attackers do this to avoid leaving traces. However, the fact that it's deleted right after might be suspicious.\n\nAnother FileCreate event for a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. That's part of PowerShell's startup profile, maybe configuring settings. Not necessarily bad, but if it's being created in a non-interactive context, that might be unusual.\n\nThen there's a Registry value set event, but no file path provided. Not enough info there. The last event is a Remote Command execution, but the process is null. That might be an indicator of something like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: PowerShell is involved in multiple actions. Loading several DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. Creating and deleting a temporary script. The remote command execution event is a red flag. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate operations, like PowerShell scripts running normally. But the combination of creating a temporary script, deleting it, and the remote command might indicate an attack. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because some of these events are common in normal operations. So, maybe \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process events include loading .NET Framework DLLs, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, and a potential remote command execution. While some activity may be legitimate, the combination of script creation\/deletion and remote execution warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
