{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, the user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's a lot of activity with certutil.exe. Certutil is a Windows utility that can be used for certificate management, but it's also commonly abused by attackers for encoding and decoding files, which can be part of malware distribution. Looking at the command lines, there's a command that uses certutil -encode on calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows tool, but encoding it might be a red flag. Then there's a decode command that creates a decoded executable in the Temp folder. That seems suspicious because creating executables in temporary directories is often a sign of malicious activity.\n\nNext, there's a process creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a legitimate configuration, but I should check if there are any unusual paths or permissions. However, the file path here seems normal.\n\nThen there's the use of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll,PcaPatchSdbTask. PcaPatchSdbTask isn't a standard command I recognize. This might be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or a backdoor. Also, the SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dllâ€”those are standard DLLs, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it could be a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nLooking at the other processes: chrome.exe has multiple network connections, which is normal, but if there's a sudden spike or connections to unusual IPs, that's a concern. However, the logs don't mention the destinations. The whoami.exe and powershell.exe processes are common, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together, the certutil usage for encoding and decoding files, creating executables in temp directories, and the unusual rundll32 command stand out. These activities are often associated with malware installation or execution. Even though some processes like chrome and powershell are normal, the combination with these suspicious actions raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because some entries could be legitimate, but the presence of multiple suspicious events makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potential data exfiltration or payload delivery), creation of executable files in temporary directories, and unusual rundll32.exe command with non-standard parameters. These patterns are commonly associated with malware operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to analyze all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of Chrome instances modifying the registry. But Chrome is a common application, and it's possible that some registry changes are normal. However, the repetition might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's anything else.\n\nThen there's an entry for SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by an unexpected process, that could be suspicious. However, SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate process, but I'm not sure. I should note that this might be a point of interest.\n\nNext, there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in the Downloads directory might be normal, especially if it's part of an installation or setup. But the filename has a .new extension, which could indicate a temporary file. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen, there are multiple events from powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but it's also commonly abused by attackers. The events here include registry value sets and process access. Process access events might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other processes, which could be benign or malicious. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or the processes being accessed, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from Chrome and PowerShell, which are common tools. However, the repetition of registry changes by Chrome might be unusual. The SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll could be benign, but it's worth checking. The winlogbeat file creation seems normal. The PowerShell events might be part of legitimate activities, but they could also be indicators of compromise if they're modifying sensitive registry keys or accessing processes that shouldn't be accessed. However, the logs don't provide enough details on the specific actions taken. \n\nSince there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, but some events are a bit suspicious, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple registry changes and process accesses that could be part of an attack. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because the events could be normal. Maybe around 0.6 confidence. But wait, the justification needs to be concise. So, the presence of multiple registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell, along with the SDXHelper loading a DLL, might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with an unusual process (SDXHelper.exe) loading urlmon.dll, suggest potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
