{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks. Each command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a common trick used by malware to run arbitrary code. The triggers are set to run at logon, which means these tasks would execute every time a user logs in. That's suspicious because legitimate tasks usually don't run calc.exe unless it's part of a test or a known good process.\n\nThe principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest, which gives the task high privileges. That's a red flag because it could allow elevation of privileges if the task is malicious. The names of the scheduled tasks are things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. These don't look like standard task names, which might indicate they're named by the attacker to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are other events related to PowerShell, such as registry value sets and process accesses. The image loaded events show .NET DLLs being loaded, which might be part of a .NET-based payload. However, just loading these DLLs isn't necessarily malicious unless combined with other suspicious activities. But in this case, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with high privileges and using PowerShell to execute calc.exe seems like a clear indicator of malicious activity.\n\nThe presence of multiple similar events suggests a pattern. The attacker might be trying to create multiple scheduled tasks to ensure persistence on the system. Since all these tasks are using the same method but different names, it's likely an attempt to evade detection by varying the task names.\n\nI should also check if there are any legitimate reasons for these tasks. But calc.exe is a simple calculator and isn't typically used in legitimate scheduled tasks. It's more likely a payload or a test. The fact that the tasks are created with administrative privileges adds to the suspicion.\n\nOther processes like chrome.exe are mentioned, but their events are less suspicious. The main concern is the PowerShell activities. The image load events for .NET DLLs might be part of the PowerShell execution, but again, without more context, the scheduled tasks are the main issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple scheduled tasks created with PowerShell, running calc.exe at logon with admin rights, and the use of .NET DLLs. This is indicative of a potential security threat. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **malicious activity** and warrants immediate investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns:**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with PowerShell:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating **scheduled tasks** with:\n     - **`calc.exe`** as the payload (a common indicator of malicious activity, as `calc.exe` is often used as a placeholder for arbitrary code in attacks).\n     - **Triggered at logon** (suggesting persistence on the system).\n     - **Administrative privileges** (`BUILTIN\\Administrators`, `RunLevel Highest`), which could be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\n2. **Unusual Task Names:**\n   - Task names like `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`, and `tarefa_geral` are non-standard and may be obfuscated or named by the attacker to avoid detection.\n\n3. **.NET DLLs Loaded:**\n   - PowerShell processes load .NET assemblies (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc.), which could indicate the use of **.NET-based payloads** (e.g., obfuscated scripts or malicious code embedded in DLLs). This is often seen in advanced attacks.\n\n4. **Repetitive Events:**\n   - Multiple entries for **`Process Create`**, **`Image Load`**, and **`Registry Value Set`** suggest **automated or scripted exploitation** (e.g., post-exploitation activities to establish persistence).\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Command Line Example:**\n  ```powershell\n  & {$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"; $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon; $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest; $Set = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet; $object = New-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User -Settings $Set; Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -InputObject $object}\n  ```\n  - This script creates a scheduled task with administrative privileges to execute `calc.exe` on logon.\n\n- **Loaded DLLs:**\n  - Paths like `C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\clr.dll` suggest .NET runtime usage, which could be part of a **malicious payload** or **script execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Assessment:**\n- **Likely Threat Type:** **Persistence Mechanism \/ Privilege Escalation** (e.g., post-exploitation activity).\n- **Risk Level:** **High** (due to administrative privileges, potential for lateral movement, and use of PowerShell for obfuscation).\n- **Recommendations:**\n  - **Isolate the affected system** for forensic analysis.\n  - **Check for other scheduled tasks** with similar patterns.\n  - **Investigate the source of the PowerShell commands** (e.g., phishing, exploit, or insider activity).\n  - **Scan for .NET-based payloads** or obfuscated scripts in memory or on disk.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs is **clearly malicious** and requires immediate investigation. The use of PowerShell to create elevated scheduled tasks with `calc.exe` as a payload is a strong indicator of an attacker attempting to establish persistence on the system."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes. The first event mentions an image loaded from a Windows Defender DLL. That seems legitimate, but then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 script. Then, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a script in Temp might be normal, but combined with PowerShell activity, it could be suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, which might be part of normal operations, but not sure. Then, the command line shows a PowerShell script that's creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, which is a common example for testing, but the user might be using it maliciously. The scheduled task is set to run at logon with high privileges for Administrators, which is a red flag. \n\nThen there are multiple Chrome.exe events with registry value sets. If that's normal, but repeated, maybe something's wrong. However, the majority of the events are about PowerShell and scheduled tasks. The later entries have \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process, which is suspicious because it might indicate unauthorized remote execution attempts.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activity creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges, combined with multiple remote command executions, even if some are from unknown processes, suggests potential malicious activity. The presence of both legitimate-looking Defender DLLs and suspicious script files in Temp could indicate a mix of normal and malicious actions. However, the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" entries without a process might be more concerning. \n\nConfidence is a bit high because of the scheduled task with admin rights and the remote commands, but I need to check if these are common. However, since the user is asking for investigation, even if some parts are normal, the combination might be enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious activity: creation of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (run as Administrators), deletion of temporary script files, and repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but loading a DLL from the System32 directory might be normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process, but repeated registry changes could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe part of normal system operations.\n\nNext, there's a file created by svchost.exe in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum\". That name doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a typo or something non-standard. Could be benign, but worth noting.\n\nThen there are entries where the process is None, and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's concerning. If the process field is None, it might mean the event didn't capture the process, which could be a sign of something evading detection. But maybe it's a log error. Need to check if there are multiple such entries. There are two of them here. That's a bit suspicious.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but also a common vector for malware. The filenames like \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\" might be normal, but the presence of file creation by PowerShell could be part of something malicious.\n\nAnother PowerShell event with registry changes. Again, could be normal, but combined with other events, maybe not.\n\nChrome.exe has several entries, mostly registry changes and loading DLLs. The DLLs mentioned, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, are part of Windows Defender. Loading those is normal, so probably not an issue here.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal during setup. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which might be unexpected. Maybe someone is trying to tamper with the configuration?\n\nAlso, multiple PowerShell events creating files like \"entrada_principal.txt\" and \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". These filenames are in Portuguese, which might be a red herring, but could indicate someone is using local language in filenames. Not sure if that's a sign of anything.\n\nThe repeated registry events from chrome.exe might be normal if the user is interacting with the browser, but combined with other suspicious events, it could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking back at the \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process, that's a significant red flag. If the system is executing remote commands without a clear process, that might indicate a compromise. However, sometimes logs might not capture the process correctly. But having two such events could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nPutting it all together: There are some suspicious events, like the remote command executions with no process, and multiple registry changes and file creations. However, many of the events are from legitimate processes like svchost, chrome, and powershell, which are common. The presence of a couple of odd events might not be enough on their own, but combined, they could indicate a potential issue. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough to warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected, including 'Execute a Remote Command' with no associated process, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, and file creation in user directories by PowerShell. These could indicate potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
