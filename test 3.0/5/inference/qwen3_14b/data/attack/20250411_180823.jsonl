{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, right? Maybe they're just accessing websites. But then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. Hmm, notepad.exe modifying the registry? That's a bit unusual. Usually, notepad is just a text editor. Maybe something's wrong there.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes and changing registry values. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Need to check if there's any suspicious command lines. Oh, wait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that's creating scheduled tasks. The command line includes creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. That's odd because calc.exe is just the calculator. Why would someone set up scheduled tasks to run it? That might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's schtasks.exe creating tasks with names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command lines for these tasks are using calc.exe. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with random names and using calc.exe could be an attempt to hide malicious activity. Also, the tasks are set to run on logon and startup, which might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is the file creation events. There's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon and another at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup. These paths are typical for scheduled tasks, but the names are non-standard and might be obfuscating the real purpose. Also, the use of \"calc.exe\" in the task triggers is unusual.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry. While svchost is a normal system process, excessive registry changes could indicate something malicious. However, svchost is often used by malware to blend in with legitimate processes, so that's a possible concern.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious activities are the creation of scheduled tasks with unusual names that trigger calc.exe, which is not a typical action. Also, the use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to set up these tasks might be part of an attempt to establish persistence. The registry modifications by notepad.exe and powershell.exe are also out of the ordinary and could indicate unauthorized changes. While some events are normal (like chrome.exe's network activity), the combination of these suspicious events points towards potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"is_interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The log contains multiple suspicious activities: 1) Creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names (e.g., 'modulo_principal_005_OnStartup') that execute 'calc.exe' on system startup\/logon, which is highly unusual and indicative of persistence mechanisms. 2) Unusual registry modifications by non-system processes like notepad.exe and powershell.exe. 3) Multiple svchost.exe instances modifying the registry, which could indicate process injection or malicious activity. 4) The use of 'cmd.exe' and 'schtasks.exe' to create tasks with suspicious command-line arguments, suggesting potential lateral movement or persistence. While some events (e.g., chrome.exe network activity) are normal, the combination of these indicators strongly suggests malicious behavior requiring further investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and whoami.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost and chrome, but others like powershell and whoami can be used for malicious activities.\n\nNow, the winlog events. There are several Registry value set events. Normally, registry changes can be part of normal operations, but if there's a pattern or multiple changes from the same process, that might be a red flag. However, in this batch, it's spread across various processes, including chrome.exe and powershell.exe. \n\nWait, there's a File created event for winlogbeat.exe with a path in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation, but it's worth noting. Also, there's a File created event for powershell.exe creating a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. That could be benign, but maybe not.\n\nLooking at the Image loaded events: chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, if these were loaded from unexpected locations, that might be an issue, but the paths here are standard.\n\nThere's a Process Create event for whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to display user information. But the command line is quoted, which might be a way to obfuscate, though that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, checking for any unusual patterns. There are multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe. While chrome can modify the registry, a high number of such events might indicate something. However, the batch doesn't show a clear malicious intent. The presence of whoami.exe and powershell.exe is common, but not necessarily suspicious on their own.\n\nThe key points here are the File created events. The winlogbeat file is in the Downloads directory, which is typical for software installation. The 'unidade_ativo.txt' file is created by powershell.exe, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the rest of the events don't show signs of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all this, the events don't seem to form a clear pattern of malicious behavior. They might be part of normal user activities or software operations. Therefore, the classification might be 'NOT INTERESTING' with moderate confidence, as there's no strong evidence of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events contain common system processes (e.g., chrome.exe, powershell.exe) and typical system activities (registry modifications, file creation). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
