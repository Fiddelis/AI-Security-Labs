The key points are:\n\n1. **Consistent Process**: All events involve the same process name, \"git.exe\". This is a common tool used for version control, often associated with developers or CI\/CD pipelines. It's not inherently malicious, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual.\n\n2. **File Creation Events**: Each log entry indicates that a file was created. The files are TypeScript definition (.d.ts) files, which are typically generated by TypeScript compilers and used for type checking in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. The presence of these files is normal during development or build processes.\n\n3. **File Paths**: The path structure points to a node_modules directory, specifically within a Cypress project (judging from the \"cypress\" folder). This suggests that these files are part of a project's dependencies, possibly being installed or updated. Node modules are standard in JavaScript\/Node.js environments and usually don't raise red flags.\n\n4. **Frequency of Events**: There are multiple entries, each creating a different .d.ts file under the same directory. While this could indicate something unusual if it happened infrequently, seeing several related events together is more typical during installation or rebuild phases.\n\n5. **Lack of Anomalies**: No signs of suspicious behavior like access to restricted areas, attempts to execute code, or deviations from normal file creation patterns are evident here. All activities align with expected developer or build environment actions.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch doesn't show any indicators of malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, all the events are from the same process: git.exe. That makes sense because when you're dealing with files and directories, Git operations can create a lot of file-related events. Each log entry mentions that a file was created, which aligns with the task field indicating \"File created.\"\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) inside the node_modules folder. Specifically, these are under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/. The filenames vary but follow a pattern like mergeAll.d.ts, mergeWith.d.ts, and so on. These look like type definitions for functional programming utilities provided by Lodash.\n\nSo, each event is git.exe creating a file in this specific directory. Since the node_modules folder is typically where third-party libraries are stored, especially when using tools like npm or yarn, it makes sense that Git would be involved in cloning or updating repositories, which might include these files.\n\nI should consider why someone would run Git in a node_modules directory. Well, if a project uses Git submodules or if the node_modules folder is part of the repository, Git could be performing operations there. Alternatively, maybe someone is using a Git-based tool that operates within this context.\n\nBut wait, is there any indication that these file creations are unusual? The paths look standard for a development environment set up with npm and Git. There's no sign of files being created outside the expected locations or any irregular naming conventions that might hint at malicious activity.\n\nAlso, considering the frequency, creating multiple small files in node_modules during an operation like a clone or install is normal. These events don't seem to be happening at an unusual rate either; each file creation is separate but sequential.\n\nAnother angle: could these file creations be part of some malicious script? It's possible, but given that they're all within the node_modules structure and are standard .d.ts files for Lodash types, it doesn't raise red flags. Malware typically looks to create or modify files in more sensitive areas like user directories or system folders, not within third-party libraries.\n\nIs there anything else? The process is consistently git.exe, so it's all coming from the same source. No other processes are involved here, which suggests a single operation rather than multiple activities from different sources that might warrant investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, these logs show normal file creation events during Git operations in a development environment. They don't indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal file creation activities by the git.exe process during typical Git operations within a development environment, specifically related to node_modules and type definitions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me start by understanding what each event looks like and then see if there's anything interesting about the entire batch.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data, each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. Each event has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process details show that \"git.exe\" is running. The winlog indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule named FileCreate. The file paths are all within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project, specifically under the lodash fp types directory.\n\nHmm, so all these events are from the same process (git.exe) and involve creating files in a predictable location. The user's path includes \"node_modules\" and \"cypress\", which suggests this is related to a development environment, probably someone working on software using Cypress for testing and Lodash for utility functions.\n\nI notice that each event has a different file being created, like orderBy.d.ts, over.d.ts, etc. These seem to be TypeScript definition files for various utility functions. Since they're all under node_modules, it's likely part of the development setup where dependencies are being installed or updated.\n\nThe repetition of the same process and similar file operations makes me think that this is normal activity when a developer is setting up or modifying their project. Git is commonly used in such environments to manage code, and creating files in node_modules could be part of installing or building packages.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. There's no indication of unauthorized access, strange file names, or activities outside the scope of typical development workflows. All the paths are expected within a project setup, and the process running is git.exe, which is standard for version control.\n\nSo considering all these points, each event in the batch is part of legitimate user activity.

So it's logging that these specific files were created by the git.exe process. The file paths all point to different TypeScript definition files under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to think about what this means. Git.exe creating files in a project directory is pretty normal when you're working with version control. If someone is setting up a project or updating dependencies, git might be cloning or pulling repositories which could involve creating new files or directories.\n\nThe fact that all these file paths are under node_modules suggests that maybe the system is installing dependencies, perhaps during a development setup. Cypress is a testing tool for JavaScript applications, and lodash is a popular utility library. Their TypeScript definitions would be part of the project's type declarations.\n\nSo each event here is just git creating a new file as part of its operation. I don't see any indicators of malicious activity here—no signs of unauthorized access, unusual processes, or attempts to modify sensitive files. It looks like standard behavior for a development environment where dependencies are being managed.\n\nI'm considering if there's anything else that might make this interesting. Maybe if git.exe was running with elevated privileges or accessing restricted areas, but the paths shown don't indicate any such thing. They're all in user directories, which is typical.\n\nAlso, since each event is just a file creation by git, and they're all under node_modules, it's likely part of a package installation process.

Git is commonly used for version control, and when developers work with Node.js projects, they often use npm packages like Cypress for testing. The creation of type definition files (.d.ts) by git could be related to the installation or update process of these packages.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is typical. It's quite normal for development tools and scripts to create or update files in node_modules during installations or when running certain commands. Since all events are from the same process (git.exe) and target a known legitimate directory structure, there doesn't seem to be any signs of malicious behavior here.\n\nAlso, looking at the file paths, they're all within a structured folder for Cypress types, which is standard in Node.js projects. There's no indication of files being created outside expected directories or accessing restricted areas. The consistent naming of the files further supports that this is part of a regular build or setup process.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether multiple file creation events from git.exe could indicate something suspicious. While it's possible for malicious software to create multiple files, in this case, the files are all type definitions which are typically static and part of the development environment. There's no variation in the filenames that would suggest they're being used for something else, like encoding malicious activities.\n\nI also need to think about the context. If these events occurred on a system where such development tools aren't supposed to be installed, it might raise more flags. But based on the information given, there's nothing suggesting an unauthorized installation or usage.\n\nIn summary, each event individually seems benign, and when looked at as a whole batch, they collectively indicate routine file creation activities during normal software development processes.

Each event has the same structure: it's created by \"git.exe\", the task is a \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\", and the file paths are all within a node_modules folder related to Cypress and lodash.\n\nFirst off, I know that git.exe is commonly used for version control. It creates or updates files as part of its normal operations, especially when cloning repositories or pulling updates. So seeing multiple FileCreated events from git makes sense in that context. The paths like \"node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/*.d.ts\" look like they're TypeScript type definition files, which are automatically generated and often not edited by hand.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about whether these events indicate something malicious. Malicious activity usually involves things like unauthorized access, creation of suspicious files, or attempts to execute code. But here, all the actions are related to standard git operations in a development environment. The user is likely working on a project that uses Cypress for testing and lodash for utility functions.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All events follow a similar pattern without variations that might suggest something's off. If there were failed attempts, or files being deleted, or access from unknown sources, that would raise flags.

The winlog task indicates that a file was created, specifically under the rule \"FileCreate\". All the events have similar structures, so they might be part of the same operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to files inside a node_modules folder within a directory named after a course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"). The specific files are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) for various functions from lodash's functional programming utilities. These include methods like trim, truncate, union, and uniqueId.\n\nGiven that these are all .d.ts files being created by git.exe, it seems like this is related to a development environment where someone is working with Node.js or similar technologies.

That suggests these are Windows log events indicating file creation activities. The files being created are various _.d.ts_ files under a path that includes \"node_modules\", \"cypress\", and \"lodash\". These paths look like they're part of a Node.js project setup, specifically related to TypeScript definitions for Lodash, which is a utility library in JavaScript.\n\nNow, I'm trying to figure out if this batch is interesting for investigation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that the user provided. Each event is a JSON object representing some system activity. The goal here is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLet me start by analyzing each event individually. They all seem to have similar structures: process name \"git.exe\", a file creation task from Windows logs, and specific file paths. Looking at the files being created, they are all under the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. The filenames look like TypeScript definition files (d.ts) related to lodash functions such as isError, isFinite, etc.\n\nSo, each event indicates that git.exe is creating these files. I know that git can be used for version control and sometimes during development, it's common for scripts or processes to clone repositories or update dependencies, which could involve file creations in node_modules.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch together: there are 18 events, all occurring under the same user directory and involving the same process. It seems like a series of file creation actions by git.exe within a Cypress project's dependencies. Since these are TypeScript type definitions for lodash utility functions, they're likely part of normal development or build processes.\n\nI should consider if this activity is unusual. Typically, when setting up or updating a project, especially with tools like npm or yarn, there would be multiple file creations in the node_modules directory as packages are installed or updated. Git might be involved here if the system is performing checks out or syncing code from a repository as part of an automated build process.\n\nIs there any indication that these events could be malicious? The files being created are standard type definitions for a well-known library (lodash), and git.exe is a common tool not typically associated with malicious activities. There's no evidence here of file creation in unexpected locations, execution of scripts, or other red flags often seen in malware.\n\nHowever, it's possible that an attacker could misuse git.exe to exfiltrate data or execute commands, but in this case, the events just show file creation without any signs of such behavior. The paths are all within a user's development directory, which is a typical place for node_modules and project files.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these events don't seem out of the ordinary. They appear to be part of normal software development or build processes. There's no indication of suspicious activity that would warrant further investigation based on this data alone.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development or builds and doesn't indicate malicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a standard development environment, likely part of normal software build processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided several JSONL entries where the process name is \"git.exe\" each time, and the task is a file creation event in specific paths under the node_modules folder related to Cypress and lodash.\n\nFirst, I should understand what these logs represent. Git is often used for version control, so it's common to see git-related processes accessing files during development. The paths here are within a \"node_modules\" directory, which suggests this is happening on a system where Node.js is installed, likely a developer's machine or a CI server.\n\nEach event is a file creation by git.exe in the node_modules folder of a specific project: \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The files created are all .d.ts files under lodash's types. These are TypeScript type definitions, which Node.js modules often include for TypeScript support.\n\nNow, considering if this batch is interesting. File creation events by git.exe during development are normal because git tracks file changes and may create or update files as part of its operations, like when indexing files or during a checkout. There's nothing inherently malicious about creating these types of files in the given directory structure. It seems consistent with typical software development activities.\n\nI should also think if there are any red flags. The process name is git.exe, which is legitimate. The file paths don't indicate anything suspicious like accessing restricted areas or creating unexpected files. There's no evidence of unusual volume or timing that might suggest a breach or attack.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any security concerns. It's more likely related to normal development activities using tools like Git and Node.js. So, classifying it as \"NOT INTERESTING\" makes sense because there are no signs of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show file creation by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the JSON objects are from the same process: git.exe. Each event has a similar structure with \"winlog\" indicating a file creation task and specific file paths under the node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash types.\n\nI'm thinking about why git.exe would be creating files in these locations. Node_modules is typically where npm packages are stored, so maybe this is part of a development environment setup. The files being created seem to be TypeScript definitions (.d.ts) for Lodash functions, which makes sense if someone is working with JavaScript or TypeScript projects using Cypress.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all belong to the same user (fiddelis) and are located within a specific course folder (S206 - Qualidade de Software). This suggests it's related to educational or project work rather than malicious activity. The consistent naming pattern in the filenames (like matches.d.ts, meanBy.d.ts) also points towards legitimate file operations during development.\n\nI'm wondering if there are any red flags here. Git.exe is commonly used for version control and shouldn't be flagged as suspicious on its own. File creation events in node_modules aren't unusual either, especially during installations or updates of npm packages. There's no indication of unauthorized access or malicious behavior like writes to unexpected locations or attempts to execute scripts.\n\nConsidering the context, this batch likely represents a user installing or updating dependencies for their project using npm, which then triggers git to create these files. Since all activities are within expected bounds and there's no deviation from standard operations, it doesn't raise any security concerns.\n\nI should also think about confidence levels. Given that everything aligns with normal development practices and there's no sign of anomalies or deviations, my confidence is high that this batch isn't interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which appears to be part of normal development activities involving npm packages and TypeScript definitions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The task in winlog is consistently \"File created\" with the rule being FileCreate. All these entries are from the same user: fiddelis, located in their Downloads folder under a course called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The paths point to various .d.ts files inside the node_modules directory of cypress and lodash.\n\nHmm, so git.exe is creating files. That makes sense because when you clone a repository or pull changes using Git, it does create new files or update existing ones. These are TypeScript definition files (d.ts), which are part of the Cypress testing framework and Lodash library dependencies. Since they're in node_modules, this seems like normal activity during development.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. No unexpected processes, no unusual file locations outside typical development directories, and all actions are related to a Git operation. The user is likely working on a project that uses Cypress for testing and Lodash for utility functions. So each FileCreate event is part of the standard setup or update process.\n\nGiven that there's nothing out of the ordinary, like access to sensitive files, attempts to execute unusual commands, or signs of data exfiltration, this batch doesn't raise any red flags.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, let's look at what each event contains. Each has a \"process\" field with the name \"git.exe\". That suggests that Git is being used here, which is a version control system. Then there's a \"winlog\" field indicating that a file was created (rule: FileCreate). The \"file\" path shows where the file was created.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by various filenames like sample.d.ts, sampleSize.d.ts, etc. These look like TypeScript files related to Lodash functions in a Cypress project.\n\nSo, the events are all about creating files during a Git operation. Since the process is \"git.exe\", it's likely that this is part of a build or setup process where multiple files are being created as part of cloning a repository or installing dependencies. The repeated file creations under the node_modules folder suggest that this is normal behavior when setting up or updating a project, especially with tools like npm or yarn which often create many files in node_modules.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

All the entries are in JSONL format, each with three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that every event has \"git.exe\" as the process name. Git is a version control tool commonly used by developers for managing code repositories. That's not unusual on its own. The task in the winlog field says \"File created,\" which means each of these events is about creating a file.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different .d.ts files within a node_modules folder. Specifically, it's under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\". These are TypeScript type definition files for the Lodash library, which is a popular utility library in JavaScript and Node.js projects.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is creating these files makes me think about common Git operations like cloning repositories or installing dependencies, especially since node_modules is a standard directory for npm packages. Cypress is likely being used as a testing framework here, given its presence alongside Lodash types.\n\nI don't see any red flags immediately. All activities seem related to normal software development processes. There's nothing indicating unauthorized access, unusual file creation outside of expected operations, or signs of malicious behavior like file deletions, modifications in restricted areas, or attempts to execute scripts. The consistent naming and structure of the files also support that these are legitimate actions during a build or setup process.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether repeated file creations could be indicative of something else, but given the context of node_modules and Git's role in managing dependencies, it seems entirely plausible and normal. There's no evidence of timestamps suggesting rapid, suspicious activity or multiple failed attempts that might hint at brute force attacks.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to monitor for deviations from baseline behavior, this batch doesn't exhibit any characteristics that would raise concerns from a security standpoint.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries where each line represents an event. All these events have similar structures: the process name is \"git.exe\", the task is \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\", and the file path points to various .d.ts files in the Cypress types folder.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what these events represent. Since it's about file creation by git.exe, this likely relates to a Git operation. Looking at the file paths, they all seem to be part of a Node.js project because they're inside node_modules and under cypress\/types\/lodash. The .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files, which means they're probably related to type definitions for Lodash in Cypress.\n\nNow, thinking about the process name git.exe, Git is commonly used for version control. When you run Git operations like cloning a repository or pulling updates, it might create new files or directories. The events here show multiple file creations of .d.ts files. This could be normal behavior when setting up or updating project dependencies.\n\nI should consider whether creating these specific files is unusual. Since they're part of the Cypress and Lodash type definitions, this seems like standard activity during a build process or when installing\/upgrading packages via npm or yarn. It's possible that someone is working on a project using Cypress, which relies on TypeScript, hence why these declaration files are being created.\n\nAnother angle to think about is whether such file creation events could indicate malicious activity. Typically, malware wouldn't create .d.ts files because they're not executable and don't directly harm systems. Malware tends to look for more sensitive data or system components. These files seem benign, related to development tools.\n\nAlso, considering the frequency of these events: 14 entries all within a similar context. It's plausible that during a project setup or update, multiple such files are created at once. There's no indication here of anomalies like file deletions, access outside the project directory, or other signs of unauthorized activity.\n\nI should also think about how to assess confidence. Since all events follow the same pattern and relate to legitimate development activities, there's a high confidence level that this isn't malicious. Unless there are additional indicators like timestamps suggesting rapid, unusual creation rates or files being created in unexpected locations, but here everything points to standard behavior.\n\nIn summary, these events look like normal file creations during the setup or update of a Node.js project using Cypress. There's no red flag indicating malicious intent, and the process involved (git.exe) is commonly associated with development activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation during normal Git operations in a Node.js project, specifically creating TypeScript type definition files for Lodash within Cypress.
