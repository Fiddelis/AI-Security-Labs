{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events are all from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that does a lot of networking and DNS lookups, especially when browsing the web.\n\nThen there are several entries related to powershell.exe. The first one shows that PowerShell set a registry value, which could be suspicious depending on what it's setting. Next, I see a process creation event where PowerShell is running a command line that starts another process with some batch files. This caught my attention because using PowerShell to execute scripts or other processes can be a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which could indicate that it's executing code or scripts. Then, there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary .ps1 script. Creating and then deleting a PowerShell script file might be an attempt to avoid detection, which is a red flag.\n\nThere are also multiple events where powershell.exe starts other batch files using Start-Process. This chaining of processes can be hard to trace and often used in attacks to hide malicious activities. The command lines show paths like \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\unidade_comum..\" which seem arbitrary but could be indicators of a script trying to access or execute files from different locations.\n\nAdditionally, there are events with Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks under powershell.exe, which might indicate that PowerShell is being used for more complex operations, possibly related to scripting or configuration changes.\n\nLastly, there's an entry from ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. While this could be legitimate (as it's often associated with Windows shell processes), combined with the other events, it adds to the overall context suggesting some level of system manipulation.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not seem suspicious on their own, the combination—especially the repeated use of PowerShell to execute scripts and batch files, along with file creation\/deletion in temp directories—raises concerns about potential malicious activity. This could be an attempt at persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes executing scripts and batch files, including creating and deleting temporary .ps1 files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal; many apps do that upon startup. Next, there's a PowerShell process setting a registry value. Not too suspicious yet since admins often use PowerShell for legitimate tasks. But I should keep an eye out if these actions are part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values and loading various DLLs. Chrome does do a lot in the background, so this might be standard behavior. However, multiple RegistryEvent tasks from different processes could indicate some activity worth monitoring. The fact that Chrome is also loading amsi.dll is interesting because AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) is used by Windows to detect malicious activities, but sometimes attackers try to bypass it.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe is accessing and creating files. Specifically, there's a FileCreate event for 'componente_principal.txt' in the user's downloads folder. This could be part of script execution or data handling. If this file contains malicious code, it would be concerning. Also, the command line shows that PowerShell is executing a batch script located at 'C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat'. Batch scripts can execute any number of commands, so I need to consider if this is part of a legitimate process or potentially malicious.\n\nAnother event involves cmd.exe running a batch file. The path 'C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat' stands out because it's a custom script name. If these scripts are performing actions like registry modifications, file creations, or network communications without proper justification, that could be a red flag.\n\nI notice several instances where conhost.exe and svchost.exe are involved in setting registry values and creating files. These processes can sometimes be used by malware to hide their activities since they're legitimate system processes. If they're part of the attack chain, it could indicate persistence mechanisms or credential dumping.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (PowerShell, cmd.exe, conhost.exe) are performing Registry writes and file creations. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks from different executables suggest a possible script or process that is modifying system configurations in bulk. The use of batch files named with terms like 'componente_principal' and paths that don't align with standard Windows processes might indicate they're part of a custom, potentially malicious payload.\n\nThe high number of events (over 30) within a short period could be an attempt to flood logs or perform tasks quickly before detection. The combination of multiple registry writes, file creations, and the use of various legitimate executables in unusual ways suggests possible lateral movement or payload installation.\n\nI'm concerned about potential persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. Without knowing the context, these activities could be indicative of an attack. Therefore, this batch does warrant further investigation to determine if any of these actions are part of a malicious campaign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that the batch of system logs shows signs that may warrant attention from cybersecurity personnel. Here's a structured summary:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Multiple Registry Modifications**: Several processes (Calculator.exe, PowerShell.exe, Chrome.exe) are setting registry values. While some might be legitimate, others could signal malicious activity.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**: PowerShell is executing a custom batch script and creating files. This could be part of legitimate administration tasks or indicate malicious scripting.\n\n3. **Chrome Behavior**: Loading AMSI DLL and other system components might be normal, but it's worth monitoring for any anomalies.\n\n4. **Batch Script Execution**: The use of custom-named scripts (e.g., 'componente_principal_script.bat') may suggest unauthorized or malicious activities.\n\n5. **Use of System Processes**: cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and svchost.exe are involved in suspicious actions, which could be indicators of malware using legitimate processes for covert operations.\n\n6. **File Creation Events**: The creation of files like 'componente_principal.txt' in user downloads could be part of data handling or exfiltration activities.\n\n7. **High Volume of Events**: Over 30 events suggest potential attempts to overwhelm log systems or perform rapid actions, possibly indicative of an attack.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of registry modifications, file creations, and the use of multiple legitimate processes in unusual ways suggests a possible cybersecurity threat. Further investigation is recommended to determine if these activities are part of a malicious campaign, including checking for signs of persistence, data theft, or system compromise."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a JSONL file with several entries. Each line represents an event with some details about the process, Windows log information, and possibly a file involved.\n\nLooking at the first seven events, they all have the same structure. The process name is \"chrome.exe\", the task in the Windows log is related to setting a registry value, and there's no file mentioned (file is None). I know that Chrome sometimes makes changes to the registry when updating settings or extensions, so this could be normal user activity. It doesn't seem suspicious on its own since browsers do interact with the registry for preferences.\n\nThen, looking at the eighth event, the process is \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I recognize as an agent used for collecting logs, maybe something like ELK stack's WinLogBeat. The task here is creating a file, and the path mentioned is \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". This seems like part of the log shipping process where it might be updating configuration files or generating new ones. Again, this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThe ninth event has \"powershell.exe\" as the process. PowerShell can do a lot, both good and bad, so I'm more cautious here. The task is creating a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_base.txt\". Now, why would someone run a powershell command to create a file in their Downloads folder? It could be legitimate, like running a script to download something or process data, but it's worth considering the context. Without more information about what the script does, it's hard to say.\n\nBut looking at the batch as a whole, most events are from Chrome and WinLogBeat, which aren't concerning on their own. The one PowerShell event might be interesting because of the potential for malicious activity. However, since only one out of nine events is unusual, I'm not sure if the entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\". It's possible that these are just normal activities, especially considering that the Chrome and WinLogBeat actions are common.\n\nI also have to think about whether there's any correlation between these events. For example, does the PowerShell script interact with anything else in a way that would make this batch more suspicious? There doesn't seem to be a direct link from one event to another beyond what's provided.\n\nConsidering all of this, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the majority are normal activities, and without more context or malicious indicators, the single PowerShell event might not be enough to warrant an investigation. However, my confidence isn't very high since any deviation in user behavior could potentially indicate something is off.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal activities such as Chrome registry updates and WinLogBeat configuration changes, with only one PowerShell file creation event that isn't sufficiently concerning on its own.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
