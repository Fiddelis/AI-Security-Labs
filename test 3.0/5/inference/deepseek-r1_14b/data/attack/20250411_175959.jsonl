{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity for browsing. Not too suspicious on their own.\n\nThen I see events involving powershell.exe. The command line in some of these shows a script that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, and others. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement or privilege escalation. The specific commands are querying user information, which could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. This isn't unusual in itself since scripts often load these components, but combined with the other activities, it's worth noting.\n\nA file was created and then deleted in the same process: a temporary PowerShell script. The filename is __PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1, which looks like part of some testing or evasion technique. Attackers might create temporary files to avoid detection.\n\nMultiple Provider Lifecycle events with the same command line as before. This repetition suggests that the script might be running multiple times or trying different approaches, possibly indicating persistence attempts or an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious commands, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and the network activities from Chrome don't immediately seem connected, but the PowerShell activity is concerning. It could be an attacker using these tools for recon or lateral movement. The confidence level is high because while some parts might be benign, the combination points towards possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe with potentially malicious command-line arguments and activities indicative of lateral movement or reconnaissance. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file further raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of JSONL events and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. powershell.exe creating a pipe.\n2. winlogbeat.exe creating a file.\n3. A PowerShell command that includes net user, get-localuser, etc., which are commands often used in privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n4. Another powershell.exe loading an image (MpClient.dll), which is related to Windows Defender.\n5. net.exe being executed with \"user\" as the argument.\n\nHmm, multiple instances of powershell.exe and net.exe running command-line arguments that could be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement. The repeated use of net.exe for user-related tasks might indicate an attack.\n\nThere's also a process where cmdkey.exe is run with \/list, which lists cached credentials. That's a red flag because attackers often use this to steal credentials.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry writes from chrome.exe, but those don't seem suspicious on their own unless they're part of some malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt, which I'm not familiar with, but the name might be suspicious in certain contexts.\n\nLooking through all events, there's a pattern of using legitimate tools (powershell.exe, net.exe, cmdkey.exe) for potentially malicious activities. The combination suggests possible unauthorized access or lateral movement within a network.\n\nSo, overall, these events are concerning and indicate potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe and net.exe commands that may indicate malicious activity such as privilege escalation or credential dumping.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, the user has provided a batch of events in JSONL format and wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. They want only one classification—either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\"—along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to understand what's happening. Starting from the top, I see several events where 'winlog' indicates tasks like 'Security Group Management'. These might be normal user group updates or permissions changes, which are pretty common and usually not suspicious on their own unless there's an unusual volume.\n\nNext, there's an event with process name 'SDXHelper.exe' loading a system file. I'm not immediately familiar with SDXHelper.exe, but since it's loading standard Windows DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll, that doesn't raise red flags. It could be legitimate software interacting with the OS.\n\nThen there are events involving 'net.exe', 'powershell.exe', and 'net1.exe' being used with command lines related to localgroup management. Using net.exe for local group commands is standard administrative activity. Powershell is commonly used for scripting, so unless the command is malicious, it's not concerning. The creation of a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData might be part of configuration scripts, which is normal.\n\nThere are also events where 'powershell.exe' creates files and modifies registry values. Again, these could be legitimate actions if done by an authorized user or script. Without seeing the content of the created files (like modulo_base.txt), it's hard to say, but the presence alone doesn't indicate malicious activity.\n\nEvents involving 'svchost.exe' modifying the registry are also common since many services run under svchost, and they do interact with the registry regularly. The MicrosoftEdgeUpdate and backgroundTaskHost processes loading system files don't seem suspicious either; they're part of standard operations for updates and background tasks.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of certain processes and events doesn't necessarily indicate malicious behavior unless there's a deviation from baseline activity or known patterns. Since all these actions are within the realm of normal user and system activities, especially in an environment where administrative tasks and script executions are common, I don't see any immediate signs of malicious intent.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the volume of events is unusual. There are several entries related to process creation and file\/registry modifications. If the baseline for this system is typically low, then a sudden spike might be noteworthy. But without knowing the usual traffic, it's hard to judge.\n\nIn conclusion, while each event individually isn't suspicious, when taken together as a whole batch, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. Therefore, classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a high confidence seems appropriate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creations, file operations, and registry modifications, which are typical for user logins, application installations, or administrative tasks. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
