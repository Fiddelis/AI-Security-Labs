{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connection detections. That seems normal because Chrome often connects to the internet, especially when browsing. So those might just be regular activity.\n\nThen I see several powershell.exe processes being created. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines in some events show script execution with commands like ls, get-childitem, and gci -recurse. Those are typical directory listing commands but could indicate someone exploring the file system.\n\nLooking further, there's a File Delete event by powershell.exe deleting a specific temp PowerShell script. Deleting temporary scripts might be normal if it's cleaning up after use, but it's also something to watch because attackers often clean up logs or files they've used.\n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events from various DLLs when running PowerShell. This is standard for process execution and isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nA FileCreate event for an .yml file by winlogbeat.exe doesn't seem concerning. That's likely configuration data being saved.\n\nAnother FileCreate event in the user's downloads folder creates a .txt file named 'objeto_principal.txt'. The name sounds Spanish, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. It might be a legitimate file or could be something else, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are also Registry value sets by both PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate software operations, but they're also common in malware for persistence or configuration changes.\n\nThe combination makes me think that while some events are normal, others like the script deletion and multiple powershell executions could indicate malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell with potentially exploratory commands is a red flag, especially combined with file deletions that might be attempts to cover tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell instances executing scripts and deleting temporary files, which may indicate malicious activity or system exploration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL lines, each representing an event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first event shows 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. That sounds normal because winlogbeat is likely the tool being used to collect logs, so it might be updating or writing log files periodically.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from 'powershell.exe'. One of them sets a registry value and another accesses a process. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But without more context, these actions alone aren't suspicious. However, the fact that they're occurring multiple times might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking further, there are several events from 'svchost.exe'. This is tricky because svchost is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various services. Malware often uses it to hide their activities. The events here are all about setting registry values. That could be part of normal service operations, but it's also something malicious might do for persistence or configuration.\n\nThen there's an event from 'calc.exe' loading a DLL file (urlmon.dll). On its own, this isn't unusual since many applications load system DLLs. However, if calc.exe is being used as a calculator, why would it need urlmon? Maybe to handle URLs or network operations, which could be malicious.\n\nAnother event shows 'Calculator.exe' doing the same thing with urlmon.dll. This repetition might indicate something is off. If both calc.exe and Calculator.exe are loading this DLL, it could be part of some automated process or a sign of malicious activity trying to blend in with normal usage.\n\nNow, looking at all events together: we have multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, file creation by winlogbeat, and two different calculator processes accessing the same DLL. The key points are:\n\n1. Multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry. While svchost is legitimate, excessive or unexpected registry writes can be a red flag.\n2. Powershell's involvement in both setting registry values and accessing processes. Without knowing the exact commands run, this could be either benign admin tasks or part of an attack chain.\n3. Both 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll. If these were legitimate uses, it would be odd for them to do so similarly, especially if they're doing more than just their standard functions.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch doesn't show a clear malicious pattern but does have several indicators that could point towards potential issues. The confidence isn't very high because each event on its own isn't necessarily suspicious, but the combination raises some concerns about possible lateral movement, persistence mechanisms, or credential dumping via registry modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe and svchost.exe modifying registry values, which could indicate potential malicious activity. Additionally, calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll may suggest unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
