Frequent registry modifications could indicate an attempt to hide processes or alter system configurations, which is a red flag. The 'Process Create' events with specific command lines are concerning too. For example, the cmd.exe command line \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\" suggests an attempt to terminate Notepad.exe processes, which might be part of a cleanup routine after malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, multiple ImageLoad tasks loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll could be signs of code injection or attempts to bypass security measures. The use of 'WMIC.exe' with commands to delete processes is another concerning behavior, as it's often used in persistence mechanisms or to cover tracks.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of process creations, registry modifications, file deletions, and command-line activities points towards potential malicious behavior.

That's somewhat normal since many applications interact with the registry. There's also whoami.exe being run, which is a common tool to check user permissions. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I see cmd.exe commands that look like they're copying files and deleting tasks. For example, one command is \"copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". This might be an attempt to replace a system file, which could indicate malicious activity. Similarly, another cmd command deletes a scheduled task with schtasks, which can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also the use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks, and then later creating a new process for it again. This pattern seems unusual because legitimate processes usually don't delete their own tasks unless there's some misconfiguration or malicious intent.\n\nPowershell is being accessed multiple times, which could be concerning since it's often used by attackers for command execution and script running. The frequency of these events without obvious purpose raises flags.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that conhost.exe is involved in registry modifications. Conhost is a legitimate process, but its use alongside other suspicious activities might warrant closer inspection.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of file copying to replace system files, deletion of scheduled tasks, and repeated powershell accesses suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence or privilege escalation.

PowerShell can be legitimate but it's often associated with malicious activities because attackers use it to execute commands and hide their tracks. I notice that in some events, powershell.exe is accessing registry values (RegistryEvent) which could indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also a file created by powershell.exe named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. Temporary script files like this might be part of testing script execution policies, but they can also be used to execute malicious scripts. Then the same file is deleted shortly after, which raises my suspicion because attackers often clean up their traces.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of cmd.exe and conhost.exe, which are common tools but could be abused for various malicious purposes. The whoami.exe being run might just be checking user privileges, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nI'm also noticing multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, which can be normal as scripts load modules, but without more context, it's hard to say. The process creations and deletions, along with pipe creation, seem a bit too active for regular user behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of processes being created, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and powershell activities that might indicate malicious behavior like persistence or script execution.

This pattern might indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts or potentially unauthorized processes. The repeated use of PowerShell could be a red flag since it's commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where files are created in temporary directories, like the one mentioned: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. Temporary files can be part of normal operations, but when combined with PowerShell activity, it might suggest script execution or file staging. The use of Registry value sets could be modifying system configurations, which is another point of interest.\n\nConsidering all these activities together, there's a high potential that this batch indicates suspicious behavior.

That might be suspicious because PowerShell is often used by attackers. Deleting files could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove malicious scripts.\n\nNext, another event where powershell.exe creates a file in Downloads. This is a bit odd since most users wouldn't use PowerShell for regular downloads. Creating a file here could be an indicator of something fishy.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying the registry. While Chrome sometimes does this when updating or changing settings, nine instances seem excessive. This might indicate some kind of automated process or potential tampering.\n\nLooking further, another powershell.exe event shows a command line that checks if certain files exist and exits based on that. The script names like \"modulo_ativo\" and paths are unusual. It seems like it's trying to check for existing files, which could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nThere's also an event where a PowerShell script is creating batch files using New-Item and Set-Content commands. This is concerning because creating new scripts on the fly can be a way to inject malicious code or create persistence points in the system.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate that PowerShell is executing some malicious code.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple file operations by PowerShell, including deletions and creations of files in non-standard locations; registry modifications by Chrome in large numbers; and the command lines showing attempts to check for specific files which might be part of a script or payload.

This seems suspicious because creating numerous batch scripts in different directories could be part of malicious activity, like setting up persistence or dropping malware components.\n\nThen, I notice some file creation events for temporary PowerShell script files. Creating and then deleting these files might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if the system is monitoring such actions. This behavior is often seen in reconnaissance or when trying to execute commands without leaving a trace.\n\nThere are also registry access events from powershell.exe, which could be part of installing persistent backdoors or altering system configurations to maintain access. Additionally, there are image load events for various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell operations but can sometimes indicate the loading of malicious libraries if they come from unexpected paths.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell executions creating files, accessing registry keys, and loading system components.

The paths in these commands seem to be constructed in a way that might be trying to access different locations on the system. For example, \"C:\\objeto_logico\\elemento_logico..\\\" and variations of similar directory structures. This pattern repeats several times across multiple events.\n\nThen, there are entries where PowerShell is creating or accessing files in temporary directories. One event shows a file being created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a specific PS script test file. Another event immediately deletes that same file. This create-delete sequence within the same process might indicate some form of scripting to avoid detection or as part of a larger process.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where other system tools like whoami.exe are being executed, and references to Windows Defender files being loaded by PowerShell. These could be normal operations, but combined with the file creation\/deletion in temp directories, they raise an eyebrow.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with such varied paths and actions makes me suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a larger script trying to check for certain conditions or attempting to execute code without being detected.

This could be normal admin activity, but it's worth noting because it involves checking files in specific paths.\n\n2. **Registry and File Activity**: Powershell is accessing the registry and creating\/deleting files in temporary directories. The creation of a script file (`.ssp.ps1`) and its subsequent deletion might indicate an attempt to bypass script execution policies or test permissions.\n\n3. **Process Creations**: Notably, whoami.exe and cmd.exe are also being executed. Using these tools can be part of reconnaissance activities, checking user privileges, or system info. The use of `cmd.exe` with a conditional statement that exits based on file existence is suspicious—it might be trying to avoid detection by only running if certain files aren't present.\n\n4. **Multiple Events from Same Process**: There are several events tied to powershell.exe accessing different parts of the system, including loading various DLLs and interacting with the filesystem. The repetition and combination of these actions could indicate a script running multiple checks or attempting to execute commands in phases.\n\n5. **Lack of Other Processes**: While I see a lot from Powershell and cmd, there's no indication of other malicious processes being spawned. However, the fact that it's trying to check for specific files and using multiple system calls is concerning.\n\n6. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: The command lines in the events reference various paths like `C:\\registro...` which seem constructed, possibly indicating an attempt to access or create certain files as part of malicious activity.

It suggests possible malicious behavior such as testing system access, attempting to execute code that's conditionally run, or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of activity, particularly the repeated checks and deletions, isn't typical user behavior and could indicate an attack.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the events are all related to processes being created or accessed, mainly involving 'whoami.exe' and multiple instances of 'powershell.exe'. I notice that 'whoami.exe' is run a couple of times, which could be normal user activity or part of some script checking permissions. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, the PowerShell activity stands out. There are several entries where PowerShell is created with specific command lines. Each command line seems to check if certain files exist in different paths and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. This could be legitimate scripting, like checking for file existence as part of an installation script or configuration process. However, the fact that there are multiple such checks across various directories might indicate something more.\n\nLooking at the file operations: I see a file being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. This is a common tactic used by malware to test execution policies without leaving behind evidence. The creation and deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1' suggests that someone is attempting to bypass script execution restrictions or testing if PowerShell scripts are allowed.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where Registry values are set and images (DLLs) are loaded. These actions can be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with the repeated file checks and deletions, they add up to a pattern that might indicate malicious activity. The use of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in PowerShell could be part of an attempt to load components or modules, which is often seen in attacks.\n\nThe confidence level isn't super high because some of these actions can be innocent, like script testing. However, the combination—PowerShell command lines checking various files, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and multiple process creations—points toward potential malicious behavior.

Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value sets and Process accesses by powershell.exe. That could be normal admin activity or something malicious trying to hide.\n\nLooking further down, I see whoami.exe being run. Usually harmless, but context matters. Then several powershell.exe commands with complex paths checking for a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that it's checking multiple locations makes me think maybe the attacker is ensuring the script exists before proceeding.\n\nThe command lines are a bit long and use \"&\" to execute, which can be used to run other scripts or hide commands. The exit codes suggest they're testing if the file exists; if not, they exit with 0, which might be trying to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there's a FileCreate and then a FileDeleteDetected event for a temporary PowerShell script. This could indicate that a malicious script is being created and then deleted to erase evidence.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated attempts to check for a specific script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), which is known for keylogging, suggests potential malicious activity.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes in the logs. That makes me a bit cautious because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and also for executing malicious commands. For example, some lines show powershell.exe checking if certain scripts exist before exiting. That could mean someone is trying to verify if they have access or if their script is present on the system.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are a couple of instances where PowerShell is being used with specific scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The paths mentioned in these command lines seem a bit off—like \"C:\\tarefa_temporario\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico\". These don't look like standard system directories, which makes me think they might be temporary or hidden locations where malicious files could be stored.\n\nThen there are events involving whoami.exe and calc.exe. Whoami is often used to check user permissions or credentials, which can be part of privilege escalation attempts. The fact that it's being run with command lines that include specific paths might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system.\n\nThe logs also show multiple network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. While Chrome connecting to networks is normal, seeing multiple network connection events without a clear purpose could be suspicious, especially if they're happening in quick succession or pointing to unusual domains. Svchost.exe is a common process for services, but when it starts making network connections, it might be a sign of malware activity.\n\nRegistry and file operations are another point of interest. Processes like powershell.exe and svchost.exe modifying the registry could be attempting to create persistent backdoors or alter system configurations in ways that allow continued access after a restart.\n\nPutting it all together, these events seem to show a sequence where an attacker might be trying to establish persistence on the system by checking for scripts, creating files, accessing other processes, and making network connections. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific scripts and the network activities from Chrome suggest possible data exfiltration or communication with external servers.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events are generated by winlogbeat.exe, which is an agent used to ship logs. If this process is creating multiple files in a short period, especially if it's not usual behavior for the system, it could be part of log tampering or attempts to create decoy logs to hide malicious activities.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't 100% because there are some normal processes like Chrome accessing networks and legitimate use of PowerShell scripts. However, the combination of these events—the unusual script checks, multiple process creations with specific command lines, network connections from non-standard services, and file\/registry modifications—points towards potential malicious behavior.

This pattern can be a red flag because attackers often create and delete files to avoid detection or leave fewer traces.\n\nThe logs show multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs when PowerShell is running. While legitimate scripts might load these modules, the combination of creating temporary files, deleting them, and using specific commands could indicate malicious activity such as lateral movement within a network or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother point of concern is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. These often happen during process initialization but in tandem with other events, they might suggest something more nefarious like persistence mechanisms or loading malicious modules.\n\nLooking at the process command lines, I see powershell.exe being called with \"& {ls -recurse...}\", which is a way to execute multiple commands. This syntax isn't typical for standard scripting and could be obfuscating malicious code execution.\n\nThere's also an instance of whoami.exe running, which typically retrieves user information. If this is combined with other activities, it might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious command lines, temporary file creation\/deletion, DLL loading, and system registry access—it seems like a coordinated set of actions that could be part of an attack chain.

Its activity is usually normal and not indicative of malicious behavior on its own.\n\n3. The third event again involves powershell.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. However, without context like multiple writes or unusual locations, it might just be legitimate administrative work.\n\n4. The fourth event has powershell.exe accessing another process. Process access could be for legitimate scripting or malicious purposes.
