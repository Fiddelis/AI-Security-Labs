{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of log events. So, I'm looking at 40 JSONL entries here, each representing different system activities. My goal is to determine if this entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" based on potential malicious behavior.\n\nFirst, I'll start by skimming through the events to get a sense of what's happening. I notice that there are several processes being created and accessed, with some familiar names like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, sc.exe, services.exe, and others. These are common tools that can be used both legitimately and maliciously.\n\nLooking closer, I see multiple instances where cmd.exe is being executed with specific command lines. For example, one event shows cmd.exe executing a script to create a service named \"win32times\" which runs another cmd command to start a PowerShell script: \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the path mentioned here is \"NonExistingScript.ps1\", which suggests that this file might not actually exist. This could be a red flag because attackers often use non-existent files as part of their obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.\n\nAnother event shows sc.exe being used to create and then query the status of the same service, win32times. The command line here also points to another PowerShell script: \"cmd \/c start c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the filename is NonExisting, which might indicate that this is a malicious attempt to execute arbitrary code or establish persistence.\n\nI also notice several Registry value sets by various processes like services.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. While legitimate software can modify the registry, repeated writes without a clear purpose could be suspicious. Additionally, the use of multiple different executables (cmd.exe, sc.exe, powershell.exe) in quick succession might be part of an attack chain trying to stay under the radar.\n\nFurthermore, there's an event where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. This is unusual because Calculator typically doesn't load such DLLs. Malware often uses legitimate processes like calc.exe to execute malicious activities, and loading specific DLLs can be a method for code injection or lateral movement within a system.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of these events. There are multiple entries involving services.exe and cmd.exe, which could indicate an attempt to create multiple services or modify existing ones as part of persistence mechanisms. The repeated use of Registry value sets by various processes might suggest configuration changes that aren't typical for normal system operations.\n\nHowever, I don't see any direct evidence of malicious activity like known malware signatures, encryption activities, or network communications in these logs. It's possible that the attackers are using more sophisticated techniques that aren't captured here, or it could just be a false positive due to legitimate script executions.\n\nOn balance, while there are several red flags—such as the use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, service creation attempts pointing to non-existent scripts, and unusual DLL loadings—the absence of clear indicators of compromise makes me cautious. It's hard to be certain without additional context or more detailed logs.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities, while not conclusive, exhibit behaviors commonly associated with malicious intent. The repeated attempts to execute non-existent scripts and unusual process activity are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\nThe analysis of the log events reveals several red flags indicative of potential malicious behavior:\n\n1. **Suspicious Command-Line Arguments**: Multiple instances where cmd.exe is used with command lines that attempt to execute non-existent PowerShell scripts (e.g., NonExistingScript.ps1). This suggests possible obfuscation or persistence techniques.\n\n2. **Service Creation and Queries**: Use of sc.exe to create and query services, which could be part of establishing persistence mechanisms in the system.\n\n3. **Unusual DLL Loading**: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is atypical behavior for such a process and may indicate code injection or lateral movement.\n\n4. **Repeated Registry Modifications**: Numerous Registry value sets by various processes, which might not align with normal operations and could be part of malicious configuration changes.\n\nWhile there are no definitive indicators of malware, the combination of these behaviors raises concerns about potential malicious activity. Therefore, further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these events. \n\n**Conclusion**: The batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" due to concerning activities that align with common attack patterns."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's look at each event step by step.\n\nThe first three events are from chrome.exe. The first two involve setting registry values, which could be normal since Chrome often tweaks system settings. The third event shows Chrome loading a file located in the Windows Defender directory. That seems legitimate because Chrome might interact with defender components for various reasons.\n\nThen there's an event from powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or multiple instances, this alone isn't suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: Chrome's actions seem routine, and the single PowerShell access doesn't raise enough red flags on its own. There's no indication of unauthorized access or known malicious behavior across these events. So, I'd classify this batch as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve normal activities such as Chrome setting registry values and loading legitimate files, along with a process access from PowerShell that isn't indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
