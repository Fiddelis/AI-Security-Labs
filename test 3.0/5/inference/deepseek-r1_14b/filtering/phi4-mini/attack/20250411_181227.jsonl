{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where the process is powershell.exe with specific command lines. The command lines are using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at login. This immediately raises a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges (BUILTIN\\Administrators group) could be a way to persistence. Also, calc.exe is often used in malware for simple tasks or as a calculator, but it's not inherently malicious—though the context here might make it suspicious.\n\nLooking further, these events are under the 'Provider Lifecycle' task category. This suggests that the system is handling some kind of service or scheduled task creation. The repeated use of Register-ScheduledTask with different names like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"registro_geral\" makes me think this could be an attempt to create multiple persistent tasks, which is a common tactic in attacks for persistence.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and processes, specifically 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed'. This aligns with how malware might try to modify system configurations or inject into other processes. Also, the file events show that PowerShell is loading various DLLs, which isn't unusual but could be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities like lateral movement.\n\nOne event stands out: a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. This seems related to PowerShell script policy testing, and it's immediately deleted after creation. The rapid creation and deletion of a script file is concerning because it could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies by testing them first before executing malicious code.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple scheduled tasks created with elevated privileges, registry modifications, temporary script file creation and deletion—all these behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activity. They could be part of a larger attack strategy, such as creating persistence points or attempting to execute arbitrary scripts without being detected for longer periods.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that this is normal admin activity, but given the combination of actions—especially the script file test—it's more likely an indicator of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits concerning signs indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges to execute `calc.exe` at login. This is a common tactic for persistence in attacks.\n\n2. **Registry and Process Access**: Events show registry modifications and process access, which could be used by malware for configuration changes or injection.\n\n3. **File Activity**: A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This behavior suggests an attempt to test system policies or execute code covertly.\n\n**Conclusion**: These activities, particularly the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and the rapid file creation\/deletion, strongly suggest potential malicious intent. Further investigation is warranted to assess the extent of any compromise and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event has a process running powershell.exe with some command line arguments. The command seems to be creating a scheduled task using PowerShell. Specifically, it's setting up a task that runs calc.exe at logon, targeting the Administrators group with high privileges. That sounds suspicious because creating a scheduled task as an Administrator could indicate persistence mechanisms commonly used by malware.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe where registry values are being set. Registry writes can be normal for applications but repeated writes without clear reason might be concerning. Maybe it's part of some configuration or malicious activity trying to hide traces.\n\nLooking further down, I see several entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This catches my attention because executing remote commands can be a sign of command-and-control (C2) communication or remote exploitation. If these are legitimate, they should have a clear context, but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event involves WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. WMI is often used by attackers for persistence and lateral movement, so this could be another red flag. Also, svchost.exe making registry changes might be trying to hide or modify system configurations, which isn't typical for a legitimate service.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the Startup folder, which is a common location for malware to ensure persistence across reboots. Additionally, the creation of a .txt file named 'entrada_principal.txt' might store configuration or commands for malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together: suspicious PowerShell commands creating administrative tasks, repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and svchost.exe, remote command executions, WMI activity, and files created in sensitive locations. These collectively indicate potential malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicative of potential malicious activities, including suspicious PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks, repeated registry modifications, remote command executions, WMI activity, and file creations in sensitive locations. These collectively suggest possible unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of entries from chrome.exe with tasks related to registry value sets. There are six such events in a row. Registry modifications can be normal for applications, especially browsers like Chrome that might tweak settings. But multiple instances could indicate something suspicious, like malware trying to persist or change configurations.\n\nThen there's a seventh event where chrome.exe makes a DNS query. That seems more benign because applications often perform DNS lookups as part of their operation, especially when navigating the web. So that alone doesn't raise red flags.\n\nThe next event is from winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as an agent used for log management. It created a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new in its own directory. This looks routine; it's probably setting up or updating configuration files. Not too concerning unless there's something unusual about the filename or path.\n\nThe last event is from powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_auxiliar.txt in the Downloads folder. Powershell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. Malware might use Powershell to execute scripts or create files. The filename \"objeto_auxiliar\" translates to something like \"auxiliary object,\" which isn't inherently suspicious but combined with the process name, it's worth noting.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple registry writes by chrome.exe could be part of legitimate updates, but they're worth monitoring. The powershell event stands out more because Powershell is a common tool for attackers. However, without additional context or evidence of other malicious activities in the logs, like failed attempts or known bad indicators, it's hard to say if this batch indicates a breach.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually these events aren't overtly malicious, and there's no clear pattern suggesting an attack. The confidence isn't super high (maybe around 0.6), but without more data points, I'd say it's not critical.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as registry modifications by Chrome, a DNS query, and file creations by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. There is no clear indication of malicious behavior in the provided logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
