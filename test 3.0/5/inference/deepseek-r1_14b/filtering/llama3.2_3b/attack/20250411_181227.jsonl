{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, a lot of the events are from powershell.exe with command lines that create scheduled tasks. They all seem similar but have different task names like 'unidade_ativo', 'entrada_temporario', etc. The commands register these tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. That's suspicious because using powershell to create scheduled tasks is a common tactic for malware to persist on the system.\n\nThen, there are events where powershell.exe loads images and creates files in temp directories. Creating temporary files isn't bad on its own, but the fact that they're being deleted right after might indicate an attempt to avoid detection. Also, some of these events show file creation and deletion of the same file, which is a red flag for hiding malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal' with BUILTIN\\Administrators group and RunLevel set to Highest. This allows the task to run with high privileges, which could be dangerous if it's part of an attack.\n\nThere are also events where chrome.exe is modifying registry values. While chrome can do this normally, multiple such events might indicate something malicious trying to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nLooking further down, there are several events where 'Execute a Remote Command' is logged. This seems concerning because executing remote commands without proper context could be an indicator of unauthorized access or command-line attacks.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows numerous powershell activities creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, file operations in temp directories, and remote command executions. These are all signs that could point to malicious behavior, like persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, or potential data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits multiple red flags indicative of potentially malicious activity. The repeated creation of scheduled tasks using powershell.exe with elevated privileges, temporary file operations suggesting an attempt to erase traces, and several instances of remote command execution are concerning. These activities collectively suggest a high likelihood of suspicious or malicious intent.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch is deemed highly suspicious for investigation due to indicators such as the creation of privileged scheduled tasks, temporary file manipulation, and remote command executions. These patterns align with common tactics used in cyberattacks for persistence and escalation.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Highly Suspicious}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first line shows svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal because svchost is a legitimate system process used by services. However, sometimes malware can disguise itself as svchost, so that might be something to look into, but not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, another event from svchost.exe where it creates a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. The path looks a bit unusualâ€”maybe it's a typo or an actual legitimate task? I'm not sure. It might be worth checking if this file is known to be malicious.\n\nThen there are two events of \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any associated files. This could indicate remote execution, which is often a sign of potential malicious activity. These stand out as concerning because executing commands remotely can be used for command-and-control or other malicious purposes.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Powershell is commonly used by attackers, so any unusual activity here could be a red flag. I need to check if this file creation is part of normal operations or potentially malicious scripts.\n\nThe Chrome.exe events are next. They show image loading and registry modifications. Since Chrome is a legitimate application, these activities might not be suspicious unless the files being loaded are known to be malicious. The Dns query from Chrome is also normal for web browsing, so that's probably fine.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory seems normal as it's likely part of log shipping or monitoring software. No issues there.\n\nPutting this all together: the two remote command executions and the powershell activity are significant. While svchost and chrome activities could be innocent, combined with the remote commands and powershell usage, it raises suspicion of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities such as remote command execution attempts (two events) and file creation by svchost.exe in an unusual path. Additionally, there is a file created by powershell.exe which could be associated with malicious scripts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
