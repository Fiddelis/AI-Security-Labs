Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving different processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, sc.exe, services.exe, and others. The events include tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, etc. \n\nLooking closely at the first event: cmd.exe is being used with a command line that looks suspicious. It's trying to create a service named win32times using sc create, and the binPath points to a script called NonExistingScript.ps1. Since the path is c:\\unidade_auxiliar... which doesn't exist, this could indicate an attempt to run malicious code by creating a service that doesn't actually exist. This might be part of a persistence mechanism where attackers try to keep their malicious activities ongoing after a system restart.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process accessed but no file information. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so this could be a red flag if the command run was something suspicious. However, without knowing the exact command, it's hard to say definitively here.\n\nThen there are several sc.exe commands creating and querying services. This might be part of an attempt to create or modify services in the system, which is another common tactic for attackers to maintain persistence. The repeated use of Registry value set tasks by various processes like services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe stands out. Modifying the registry can allow attackers to make persistent changes, so this could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe events involving calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll are interesting too. While these might seem innocent at first glance, there's a known technique where legitimate processes are used to load malicious DLLs. The fact that urlmon.dll is being loaded by these processes could indicate an attempt to inject code or alter the behavior of these applications for malicious purposes.\n\nThe repeated Registry value sets across different processes and multiple entries of chrome.exe modifying registry values could also be concerning. If a browser process like chrome.exe is making unusual registry changes, it might suggest that some form of malware is using it as a vector.\n\nTaking all these points into account, the combination of creating non-existent services, PowerShell activity without clear benign use, registry modifications across various legitimate processes, and loading DLLs through innocent-looking applications suggests potential malicious behavior. These actions are often indicators of an attack chain, possibly involving persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile some of these events individually might not be conclusive, the overall pattern—especially the repeated attempts to create services with non-existent scripts and the registry modifications across multiple processes—points towards something worth investigating further. Therefore, this batch is classified as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activities including service creation attempts with non-existing paths, PowerShell access, and multiple registry modifications. These indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or code injection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
