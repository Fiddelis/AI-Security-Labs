Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: Microsoft Edge is updating or something because it's changing the file creation time. That seems normal since Edge regularly updates. Next, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll—that's part of Windows Defender Antivirus, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes are used for interprocess communication; not inherently bad, but sometimes malware uses them. I'll keep that in mind. But the rest of the events don't show any anomalies around this.\n\nThere are several entries about Special Logon and User Account Management. These could be related to user logins or system accounts being accessed. Without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious, but they might indicate some account activity worth looking into.\n\nLooking further, I see services.exe and taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is standard for scheduling tasks. Svchost.exe modifying the registry—it's a common process that can do legitimate things, so unless it's doing something unusual here, it's probably fine.\n\nThere are two events where powershell.exe is being executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command inside checks some .inf files for specific patterns. Using PowerShell restrictively isn't inherently bad, but sometimes attackers use it for scripts. This particular script seems to be looking for something in the INF files, which might indicate a search or analysis of system files. Could be benign admin activity or could be malicious.\n\nThen there are more instances of taskhostw.exe and MpCmdRun.exe loading DLLs related to Windows Defender, which is expected antivirus behavior—nothing suspicious here.\n\nConhost.exe modifying the registry again. Conhost is used by command-line tools like cmd.exe, so it's likely normal unless it's doing something unexpected.\n\nLastly, git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory—definitely benign; someone is working with Node.js modules.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are standard system activities. The powershell.exe command catches my attention because it's executing with an ExecutionPolicy and could be checking for certain file patterns that might be part of malicious activity. However, without more context or evidence of other suspicious behaviors (like persistence mechanisms, unusual file accesses, etc.), it's hard to say definitively if this is malicious.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because while the PowerShell command could be concerning, there's no clear indication of malicious intent in combination with these logs. The confidence isn't super high but on the lower side because of that one potentially suspicious event.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch primarily contains normal system activities such as updates, antivirus operations, and standard user logon events. While there is a PowerShell command execution with restricted policies, it doesn't provide clear evidence of malicious intent without additional context.\",\n  \" CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"LOW\"\n}\n```"}

Each one is a JSON object with some details about a file creation event on a Windows system. The process name is always git.exe, and the task is \"File created\" under the rule FileCreate. The file paths all seem to be within a node_modules directory, specifically for semver.\n\nHmm, node_modules is where Node.js packages are stored, so this looks like it's related to installing or updating a package. Semver stands for semantic versioning, which is a tool used to compare software versions correctly. So, these file creations could be part of the installation process when someone runs npm install or updates their dependencies.\n\nI notice that each event creates different files within semver and its internal subdirectories. Since git.exe is involved, maybe it's during a clone or sync operation where the repository is being set up. Alternatively, if this is happening on a development machine, these file creations are normal when installing new packages or updating existing ones.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication that these files are being accessed inappropriately or that there's unauthorized access.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user has given me a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a Windows system. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first line, I see that each event has three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which makes me think this is related to Git operations. The winlog task mentions a file creation event triggered by a rule called FileCreate. That seems pretty standard—files being created all the time.\n\nNow, looking at the files being created, they're all in paths like \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\" followed by various JavaScript files: Number.js, Object.js, String.js, and so on. These look like core modules for a Node.js package called 'tcomb'. I remember that when you install or update Node.js packages, especially using npm, Git might be involved in version control operations, maybe during the installation process.\n\nSince all these events are from the same user (fiddelis) and point to the same directory structure, it seems like a legitimate activity. The repeated creation of files under node_modules is typical when installing or updating packages. I don't see any signs of malicious behavior here—no suspicious file names, locations outside standard directories, or other red flags.\n\nI also notice that each event is a separate JSON object but they all share the same process name and similar file paths. This repetition suggests a bulk operation, like extracting files during an npm install, rather than something more nefarious.\n\nConsidering all these points, I don't see any indicators of compromise (IoCs) or unusual patterns that would raise red flags. The events are consistent with normal software development activities involving Git and Node.js modules.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory, indicating legitimate software installation or updates rather than malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first line is a JSON object with \"process\": {\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, which tells me the process involved is git.exe. The \"winlog\" shows that the task is \"File created\", and the rule is FileCreate, so it's about a file being created. The file path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\isSubsetOf.js.\n\nThe second event is similar: git.exe creating another file at the same directory but with a different filename, isType.js. The third event again has git.exe creating isUnion.js in the same path.\n\nPutting them together, all events are from the same process and involve the creation of files related to node_modules. The user's profile shows it's someone named fiddelis working on a course called \"Qualidade de Software\" (Software Quality) at Inatel. Node modules are typically part of JavaScript projects, especially with tools like npm.\n\nIs this activity suspicious? Well, git.exe is commonly used for version control, and when you install or update node_modules, it's normal to create new files as part of the package installation process. These files (isSubsetOf.js, etc.) might be part of a library or module being installed. There's nothing inherently malicious about creating these files, especially in a development context.\n\nI don't see any red flags like unexpected paths, execution from user directories, or unusual file names. It all fits the pattern of a developer working on a project using git and node.js. So as a whole batch, this doesn't raise any concerns for investigation. The activities are consistent with legitimate software development practices.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve the creation of files by git.exe during normal npm package installation or updates, which is typical in a development environment and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
