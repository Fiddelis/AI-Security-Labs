{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to processes loading images or creating files. For example, there are multiple instances where SDXHelper.exe is loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These seem like standard system processes, so maybe nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nThen I notice some rundll32.exe being executed with a specific command line. Rundll32 is often used by legitimate applications, but sometimes it can be abused by malware. The command line here calls shell32.dll and creates a local server. That could be a red flag because it's a technique that might be used for persistence or lateral movement.\n\nThere are also events involving svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Svchost is commonly associated with legitimate services, but it can sometimes be used by malware to hide processes. Winlogbeat seems like it's related to log management, which makes sense if it's part of the system's monitoring setup.\n\nEXCEL.EXE appears multiple times with different image loads and a DNS query. While using Excel is normal, the fact that it's loading various DLLs from the system32 directory could be concerning. Malware sometimes injects code into legitimate processes like Excel to avoid detection.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe is another process I recognize as part of Windows Management Instrumentation. It's used for remote management, but in some cases, attackers might misuse it for command and control or lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and frequency, there are several repeated events from the same processes loading similar DLLs. This repetition could indicate normal operation, but it's worth checking if these activities are part of the baseline or if they're anomalies.\n\nI also see multiple entries related to User Account Management in the winlog task. These might be legitimate logon events, but a spike in such logs could signal account compromise or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe presence of rundll32.exe and WmiPrvSE.exe with unusual command lines adds some concern. Additionally, the Excel process making a DNS query might be reaching out to an external domain, which could be part of communication with a command serverâ€”a common sign of malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while individually many events seem benign or even expected, the combination raises flags. The use of multiple techniques like DLL injection, process creation with specific parameters, and DNS queries from unexpected processes could indicate a coordinated attack or lateral movement within the network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, including suspicious process creations (rundll32.exe and WmiPrvSE.exe), repeated image loads from system files by EXCEL.EXE and SDXHelper.exe, and a DNS query that could be part of command-and-control communication.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of system logs and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation. There are five events here, all related to Excel.exe processes.\n\nFirst event: Excel creating a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\real_values.csv.LNK\". That seems normal because Excel often creates shortcut files in that Recent folder. It's tracking recent documents or something like that.\n\nSecond event is the same as the first, so just another instance of creating a file. Maybe it's a repeated action during startup or when opening multiple files.\n\nThird, fourth, and fifth events show Dns query tasks from Excel.exe. That's interesting because why would Excel need to perform DNS queries? Normally, I don't expect Office applications to make network requests unless there's some specific feature like online collaboration, data storage in the cloud, or maybe updating add-ins. But if this is happening multiple times, it could be suspicious.\n\nNow, considering all events together: two file creation events and three Dns queries from Excel. The file path seems legitimate, but multiple Dns lookups might indicate something malicious, like trying to contact command-and-control servers or exfiltrating data. However, without seeing the actual DNS domains queried, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nBut on the other hand, some legitimate processes do perform DNS queries. For example, Excel might be checking for updates or accessing online content. So maybe this isn't suspicious after all.\n\nI'm a bit torn here because while multiple Dns queries can be a red flag, sometimes applications do make such requests as part of their normal operation. Since I don't have more context about the specific DNS queries being made, it's hard to classify this batch definitively.\n\nHowever, given that there are three repeated Dns query events from Excel.exe, which is an application not typically associated with network activities, this might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries from Excel.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
