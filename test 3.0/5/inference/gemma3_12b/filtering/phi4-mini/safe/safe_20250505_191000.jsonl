The repeated loading of urlmon.dll alongside Excel raises suspicion of potential web-based malicious activity. Additionally, the recent file creation of links (.LNK) by Excel, and the associated DNS queries are also indicative of potential malicious behavior. Finally, SDXHelper.exe appears repeatedly.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
