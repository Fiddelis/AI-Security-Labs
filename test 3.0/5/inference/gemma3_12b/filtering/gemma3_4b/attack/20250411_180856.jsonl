The DLLs loaded by WMIC include amsi.dll and urlmon.dll which are often leveraged in malicious activities. The presence of registry modifications by multiple processes warrants investigation. The repeated loading of urlmon.dll by various processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe) alongside registry modifications and Powershell activity is suspicious. While some entries appear benign (e.g., notepad.exe, winlogbeat.exe, calc.exe), the overall combination of events suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
