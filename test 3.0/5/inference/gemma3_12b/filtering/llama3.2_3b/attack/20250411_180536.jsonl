The use of `sc.exe` to create services and the use of cmd.exe to create services are highly indicative of potential malicious intent. Frequent PowerShell access further suggests potential script execution. The inclusion of `tarefa_logico.exe` accessing a .NET DLL also warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
