While calc.exe itself isn't malicious, the pattern of creating scheduled tasks with administrator privileges is a common tactic used by attackers to achieve persistence and elevate privileges. The repeated execution and variation in task names further increase suspicion.  The image loading events related to .NET components suggest PowerShell is being used in a more complex operation. The chrome.exe events alongside PowerShell are also potentially interesting and warrant closer inspection for potential command-line injection or unusual interactions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
