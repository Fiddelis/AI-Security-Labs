The commands utilize temporary files and involve base64 encoding\/decoding, which are common tactics for evading detection. The presence of `powershell` and `cmd.exe` alongside `certutil` further increases suspicion. The repeated use of `chrome.exe` with network connections is also noteworthy, but less concerning than the `certutil` activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
