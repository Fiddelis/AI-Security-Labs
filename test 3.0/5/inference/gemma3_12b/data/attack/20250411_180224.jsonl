These scripts appear to be attempting to run non-existent files (`objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which is likely an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of the `system` account for the scheduled tasks is also concerning. Furthermore, multiple instances of Chrome.exe have numerous registry modifications, indicating potentially suspicious user activity. The presence of `winlogbeat` creates some noise but doesn's diminish the risk\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
