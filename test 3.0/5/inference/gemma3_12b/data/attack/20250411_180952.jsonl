Specifically, there are numerous instances of user creation commands (net user, net group) using hardcoded usernames and passwords, which strongly suggest an attacker is attempting to gain administrative privileges. The frequent creation of temporary files by svchost and the use of PowerShell further increase suspicion, along with the Winlogbeat and pacote_base.txt file creations.  These behaviors warrant immediate investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
