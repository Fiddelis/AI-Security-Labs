{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repeated registry modifications and image loads associated with chrome.exe, along with suspicious file creation by powershell.exe, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repetition of Registry Modifications**: There are numerous instances where `chrome.exe` is setting registry values. While this can be legitimate, the frequency suggests possible persistence mechanisms or attempts to modify system settings in a manner typical of malware.\n\n2. **Image Load Events for Defender Components**: The loading of files such as `amsi.dll`, which is part of Windows' Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), could indicate an attempt to evade detection by interacting with anti-malware services.\n\n3. **File Creation by Powershell.exe**: PowerShell is often used by both administrators and attackers for automation tasks. The creation of a file (`unidade_logico.txt`) in the user's Downloads folder, combined with other suspicious activities, may suggest misuse or an attempt to execute scripts.\n\n4. **Suspicious File Operations by winlogbeat.exe**: Although `winlogbeat.exe` is typically used for log shipping and monitoring, it could be involved if an attacker uses a legitimate tool in a malicious way (a technique known as 'living off the land').\n\nThese combined activities are indicative of possible malicious behavior that warrants further investigation. The confidence level reflects the strong indicators present within the batch of events."}
