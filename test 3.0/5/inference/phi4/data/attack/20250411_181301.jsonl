Moreover, winlogbeat.exe is creating files in unusual paths, suggesting potential lateral movement or data exfiltration. The combination of process access, image loading from key directories (e.g., Windows Defender components), and repetitive registry modifications across different processes suggests potentially coordinated malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
