The use of 'powershell.exe' and 'conhost.exe', known for their potential misuse by attackers for script execution and command line operations respectively, increases the risk profile. Additionally, the 'chrome.exe' process is involved in setting registry values repeatedly, which may suggest it's being leveraged to maintain certain configurations or execute scripts. The inclusion of a legitimate activity like 'winlogbeat.exe' file creation does not negate the potential threat posed by these other activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
