{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about ShellExperienceHost.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are Windows system processes. Next, svchost.exe setting a registry value—svchost is a common service host process, so that's typical too. Then there's an empty process entry with no task or file, which might not mean much.\n\nExplorer.EXE modifying the registry again is standard since it's part of the shell. Chrome.exe starting up with its command line is normal; I see that in my own system logs all the time. There are a few events where chrome.exe creates pipes and modifies the registry—this aligns with how Chrome handles interprocess communication and settings.\n\nI notice multiple Registry value sets by chrome.exe, but that's expected as applications often interact with the registry for configuration. The DNS query from Chrome is typical when browsing the web. Loading of system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by Chrome is also standard since these are part of Windows security features.\n\nLooking at WmiPrvSE.exe starting with specific parameters—I know this process is related to WMI, which can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. However, the file path seems normal, so maybe it's just regular activity. The svchost.exe instances starting as LocalSystem and LocalService are standard for various Windows services.\n\nThere are several Network connection detected events from both Chrome and svchost.exe. Since Chrome is a browser, network connections are expected. Svchost might be part of some service communicating over the network, which isn't unusual unless there's an anomaly in the traffic.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events are typical Windows and application activities. While WmiPrvSE.exe can be a red flag, the given file path doesn't indicate anything malicious. The repeated registry writes by Chrome don't seem suspicious without additional context like unexpected values or persistence mechanisms. No unusual processes or files stand out, so I'm leaning towards this batch not being particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and network connections.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs from Windows systems. Each event has details about the process name, some task information from winlog, and possibly file paths.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there's \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values and creating pipes. Then, \"winlogbeat.exe\" is creating files in its own directory, which makes sense since it's probably logging data. Another event shows \"updater.exe\" being executed with some command line arguments related to GoogleUpdater. It also creates a pipe.\n\nI notice that \"chrome.exe\" is doing several registry writes and loading taskschd.dll, which is a common system file, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own. The updater process might be normal if it's part of legitimate software updates.\n\nThere's also an instance where \"svchost.exe\" starts the BthAvctpSvc service, which sounds like Bluetooth-related, and that's usually standard Windows behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual file creations outside expected locations or processes that aren't supposed to run. There are no failed logins, unknown executables, or writes to unexpected registry areas. All the activities seem to be related to normal system operations, software updates, and logging.\n\nSo, after reviewing each event together, I don't see anything malicious jumping out. The batch doesn't indicate any obvious signs of compromise like unexpected processes or file accesses.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and file operations related to legitimate software like Chrome, Winlogbeat, and GoogleUpdater. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
