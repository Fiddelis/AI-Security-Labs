{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few entries involve 'powershell.exe' being accessed and a 'whoami.exe' process creation. PowerShell is often used maliciously, but on its own, these could be legitimate activities. The user might just be using it for system admin tasks.\n\nNext, there's a command line showing the creation of 'estrutura_principal.exe' via cmd.exe and reg.exe adding entries to the registry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This seems suspicious because modifying the Run key typically relates to persistence mechanisms—like creating a startup folder entry or scheduling tasks on boot. If an external file is being added here, it could indicate malware attempting to persist across reboots.\n\nAnother cmd.exe process sets another registry value with 'pacote_temporario.exe'. Again, this points towards potential malicious activity since unusual files in the Run key can be indicators of compromise (IoCs). These actions are common tactics in attacks where adversaries try to ensure their tools run at system startup.\n\nThere's also a 'conhost.exe' process modifying the registry. Conhost is often used by attackers to host payloads or establish persistence, so this adds another layer of concern. Combined with the other registry changes, it strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent.\n\nLooking further down, there are entries about file creations involving '.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is an ELK stack tool for log shipping, which is usually benign. Unless there's something unusual in how it's being used here, these might not be concerning on their own, but the presence of other suspicious activities makes me consider if this could be part of a larger attack.\n\nConsidering all events together: multiple instances of PowerShell access and command execution, several cmd.exe processes with commands to modify the registry to add external executables—these are red flags. The repeated use of reg.exe and cmd.exe for registry modifications is a classic technique used in attacks for persistence. Additionally, the specific file paths like 'modulo_padrao.txt' and executable names such as '.exe' suggest potentially malicious payloads.\n\nThe fact that these activities happened in sequence, possibly from the same user or process, indicates a coordinated attempt rather than unrelated legitimate actions. While some events individually might not be alarming, their combination strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence on the system.\n\nI'm also noting that there are two entries where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates files. If this tool is being misused, it could be part of an attacker's toolkit for exfiltration or log tampering, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively. However, in combination with the other suspicious activities, it adds to the overall risk.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity: unauthorized registry modifications using cmd.exe and reg.exe, repeated use of PowerShell which is often a tool for attackers, and the creation of files that could be part of an attack payload. These factors together make the batch highly relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications by cmd.exe and reg.exe to add executables, repeated PowerShell usage, and file creation events indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
