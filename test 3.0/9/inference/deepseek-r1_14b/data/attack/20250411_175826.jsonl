{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not. Let me look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome handles a lot of network traffic and DNS lookups as part of its operation. Nothing unusual here; users browsing the web would trigger these events.\n\nNext, I notice multiple powershell.exe processes being created and accessed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. Looking at the command lines, one script sets LastWriteTime on files to a very old date (01\/01\/1970), which might be an attempt to hide file activity or make it look older than it is.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate and subsequent FileDeleteDetected for a temporary PowerShell script. This could indicate the creation of a malicious script that gets deleted after execution, possibly to avoid detection. Such behavior can be a red flag because attackers often clean up their traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are events showing registry value sets from powershell.exe and other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe. Registry modifications are common in attacks to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, so this adds to the concern.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands modifying file timestamps and creating temporary files suggests potential malicious activity. The combination of process creation, registry changes, file manipulation, and network activities in a single batch is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes show suspicious command-line arguments attempting to modify file timestamps, create and delete temporary scripts, and access registry values. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, many of them involve PowerShell.exe processes with command lines that modify file timestamps. The command line arguments show commands like `Get-ChildItem` and setting LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". This is suspicious because altering file times can be a tactic used in malware or persistence mechanisms to hide recent changes.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where svchost.exe and Calculator.exe are involved in registry value sets. While svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, it's often used by malware to run malicious code. Registry modifications could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAnother point of interest is the repeated use of `winlogbeat.exe` creating files and modifying configuration. If this is unexpected in the environment, it might be part of log tampering or installation of monitoring tools without proper authorization.\n\nThere are several events where common processes like chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and others perform registry writes. While some registry activity is normal, the frequency and specific tasks (like multiple Registry value sets) could warrant closer inspection to ensure they're legitimate actions.\n\nSome events don't show file paths or have null files, which might mean the activities are attempting to avoid detection by not accessing known files or using tools like PowerShell to perform operations that leave minimal footprints.\n\nPutting it all together, these events exhibit behaviors that could indicate malicious activity, such as timestamp manipulation, unauthorized registry changes, and the use of legitimate processes for potentially illegitimate purposes. The combination suggests a possible attack vector, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are modifying file timestamps to '01\/01\/1970', which is suspicious and often used in malware to hide activity. There are also numerous registry modifications by svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, and other processes, potentially indicating malicious behavior or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're worth investigating. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first line is from Chrome setting a registry value. That seems normal because Chrome often modifies the registry for settings or updates. Then there are some empty events with no details, which might just be noise or unrelated activity.\n\nNext, I see multiple instances of Chrome loading files like AMSI.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender components used for antivirus scanning. It's common for processes to load these to ensure they're protected, so this doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nThere's an event from winlogbeat creating a config file. Winlogbeat is a known tool for collecting logs, so that activity is expected and not suspicious.\n\nAnother event has PowerShell creating a file named 'unidade_logico.txt'. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, the filename seems benignâ€”maybe related to logical unit configuration or user notes. Without more context, this isn't necessarily concerning.\n\nLooking at the pattern, most events are repetitive registry writes from Chrome, which is standard for browser updates or settings changes. The few other processes don't show any irregular behavior like access to unexpected files or unusual registry modifications.\n\nOverall, there's no indication of malicious activity here. All actions seem related to normal system operations and legitimate software behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities such as Chrome modifying registry settings, loading legitimate system files, and other processes creating configuration or temporary files. There is no indication of malicious behavior in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
