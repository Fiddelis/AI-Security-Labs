{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I see multiple entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that raises some flags right away.\n\nFirst event has powershell.exe accessing something. Then there's whoami.exe being executed, which on its own isn't suspicious, but combined with the other events might be part of a larger script. I notice several instances where powershell.exe is creating files in temporary directories and then deleting them shortly after. That's a bit concerning because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nLooking at the command lines for powershell.exe, there are scripts using Compress-Archive to create ZIP files from certain paths. The paths referenced like \"modulo_temporario\" or \"elemento_temporario\" suggest temporary or transient directories. This could be part of normal operations, but it's also a technique used in malware to package malicious payloads.\n\nThe events show the creation and deletion of specific .ps1 scripts in the user's temp directory. Creating and then deleting such files quickly might indicate an attempt to avoid detection by removing logs or scripts that could expose malicious activities.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines, each targeting various directories and files. This pattern suggests a script running multiple commands, possibly indicating automated malicious behavior. Additionally, the registry accesses might be attempting to establish persistence or modify system configurations, which are common in malware.\n\nThe events also log image loads related to .NET framework components. While this is normal for powershell scripts, it's worth monitoring if these modules are being loaded unusually often or from unexpected paths.\n\nGiven all these points—multiple powershell.exe instances, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, script-based operations targeting various system paths, and potential registry modifications—it seems like there might be malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to confirm definitively.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are creating and deleting files in the temp directory, possibly indicating malicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's common for both legitimate use and malicious activities since PowerShell can do a lot. The command lines have stuff like Compress-Archive being used. While that's a normal cmdlet for creating zip files, attackers might abuse it to package stolen data or create payloads.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're pointing to various locations like TEMP directories and module files. The fact that these are in different parts of the filesystem doesn't immediately raise red flags, but repeated writes to TEMP could indicate something suspicious, especially if those files are later executed.\n\nThere are events where Registry values are being set. That's a bit concerning because attackers often modify registry entries to maintain persistence or change system configurations. I'm seeing multiple instances of this across different processes like PowerShell and svchost.exe, which is a known process for services but can also be used maliciously.\n\nAlso, some of the events show file creation, like .winlogbeat.yml.new. If that's part of legitimate operations from tools like winlogbeat, it might not be an issue, but unusual filenames or paths here could indicate tampering.\n\nProcesses like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are running, which aren't inherently bad, but their presence alongside other suspicious activities could be a sign. Notepad and Calculator are innocent applications, so unless they're doing something out of the ordinary, they might not be relevant here.\n\nI also see some ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll in processes like calc.exe and Calculator.exe. While urlmon is a standard Windows DLL for URL handling, attackers sometimes use legitimate modules in malicious processes to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a lot of activity involving PowerShell with archive commands, registry modifications across several processes, and file operations that might not align with typical user behavior. The combination suggests potential malicious behavior because attackers often string multiple actions together to hide their tracks or facilitate an attack. However, without more context on the environment and whether these activities are expected (like in a development setting), it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the red flags like PowerShell commands, registry changes, and file compression that could indicate data exfiltration or payload creation. My confidence is about 0.75 because while some indicators are concerning, others might just be normal for a system with active administration or development work.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\n**Confidence Level: 0.75**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **PowerShell Activity:** The presence of multiple PowerShell.exe processes executing Compress-Archive cmdlets raises suspicion, as attackers may use such commands for data exfiltration or payload creation.\n- **Registry Modifications:** Frequent Registry value sets across various processes (e.g., svchost.exe, PowerShell) could indicate malicious attempts to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n- **File Operations:** Writes to TEMP directories and the creation of files like .winlogbeat.yml.new might suggest unauthorized access or tooling activity.\n- **Process Activity:** The running of processes such as conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe alongside other activities may warrant further investigation, though they aren't inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of PowerShell commands, registry modifications, and file operations suggests potential malicious behavior. While some indicators might be part of normal system activity, the overall pattern is concerning enough to merit closer examination."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, each representing some system activity. My task is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first seven events are all from 'chrome.exe' with the task being 'Registry value set'. That seems normal since Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings.\n2. Then there's an event where Chrome loads 'amsi.dll', which is related to anti-malware scanning. That's a standard Windows process, so not suspicious.\n3. Next, Chrome loads another DLL from Windows Defender, which again is expected behavior as part of system protection.\n4. The ninth event is another registry set by Chrome—nothing unusual here.\n5. The tenth event is 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its directory. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect logs, so this seems legitimate.\n6. The eleventh and thirteenth events involve 'powershell.exe' being accessed. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad purposes, so I need to look at what it's doing. However, these events just show access without any command-line details, making them less concerning on their own.\n7. The twelfth event is running 'whoami.exe', which is a basic system info tool. It’s commonly used by scripts or users to check permissions and might not be malicious unless used in a specific context.\n8. The fourteenth event again shows PowerShell access without any commands, so similar to the others.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events are routine activities from Chrome, log collection tools, and standard system utilities. While there are multiple instances of Chrome accessing the registry and loading DLLs, these are normal operations for a browser and its associated services. The use of PowerShell is common but without specific commands or indicators of malicious activity, it's hard to flag them as suspicious. Similarly, 'whoami.exe' running alone isn't enough cause for concern.\n\nI should also consider if the frequency of events matters. Seven registry writes by Chrome in a row might seem high, but it's possible during initial setup or updates. The other events don't show any unusual patterns like unexpected file creations, network connections, or privilege escalations.\n\nTherefore, while I'm cautious about PowerShell and 'whoami.exe', there's no concrete evidence of malicious behavior in the given batch. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence because all activities appear legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity, including Chrome registry interactions and legitimate process creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
