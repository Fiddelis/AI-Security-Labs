{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups when browsing the web. So, those alone might not be suspicious unless there's something unusual about the URLs or timing, but nothing stands out here.\n\nThen, looking at the powershell.exe events, things get more interesting. The first event shows that PowerShell is being executed with a command line that includes downloading files from GitHub repositories. Specifically, it's using WebClient to download LICENSE.txt files into the TEMP directory under different names like modulo_padrao.txt and others. This caught my attention because downloading files from raw.githubusercontent.com could be part of script execution or payload delivery.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, which is normal when scripts load various DLLs for execution. But combined with the file downloads, it's something to look into. Then, a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script test file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1) followed by its deletion. This could indicate that the script was testing permissions or trying to avoid detection by deleting evidence.\n\nThe last few events show multiple instances where powershell.exe is used with similar command lines, each downloading a LICENSE.txt from different GitHub repositories into TEMP files with varying names. Each of these has the same task as 'Provider Lifecycle', which might not be alarming on its own but in combination with the others suggests a pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from various GitHub repos and creating\/deleting temporary script files. This could indicate either automated script execution (maybe legitimate), or potentially malicious activity like downloading scripts for lateral movement, persistence, or exfiltration. The use of raw.githubusercontent.com is common in malicious scripts because they can be easily hosted without raising suspicion.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the combination of PowerShell command lines with file downloads and temporary script handling might indicate some form of malicious behavior, such as downloading a payload or establishing persistence mechanisms. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context on what these scripts are doing beyond just downloading files.\n\nSo, overall, there's enough activity that could be suspicious but doesn't conclusively prove anything. It definitely warrants further investigation to determine if these actions are part of a legitimate process or an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub and creating\/deleting temporary scripts suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where `powershell.exe` is involved in downloading files from GitHub repositories. Specifically, the command lines show that PowerShell is using WebClient to download files like LICENSE.txt into temporary locations. This caught my attention because PowerShell scripts are often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for malicious activities, especially when downloading files from external sources. The fact that there are multiple such events makes me think this could be part of an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nNext, there are numerous entries where `chrome.exe` is modifying the registry. While Chrome does make changes to the registry during normal operation (like setting preferences), multiple instances of Registry value sets without any other context might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not typical user actions.\n\nI also see events related to `winlogbeat.exe`, which I recognize as part of the Elastic WinLogBeat service used for log shipping. The file creations in the path mentioned seem benign on their own, but combined with other activities, they could be part of a larger script or process.\n\nThere are entries where processes like `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` access resources. These are legitimate Windows services, so unless there's an unusual pattern, they might not raise flags on their own.\n\nAnother point is the event where `notepad.exe` modifies the registry, which is unusual because Notepad typically doesn't interact with the registry in normal operations. This could indicate that another process is using Notepad for something unexpected.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell downloads from external sites, repeated Chrome and Notepad registry changes, and potential service interactionsâ€”this combination suggests possible malicious activity. It's plausible that an attacker is using a script (like a PowerShell one-liner) to download malicious files and execute them, while also making efforts to maintain persistence or cover tracks by modifying system configurations.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or additional event types (e.g., process termination, file execution), it's hard to be certain. But the volume of potentially suspicious activities does increase the likelihood that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from external sources and making registry changes, combined with repeated Chrome and Notepad.exe registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are multiple entries showing processes like svchost.exe and powershell.exe making changes to the registry. Specifically, there's a lot of activity deleting registry keys related to scheduled tasks and run-on-startup entries. This seems unusual because legitimate applications typically don't delete these kinds of registry entries so frequently.\n\nI also notice several commands using cmd.exe and powershell.exe to execute scripts that modify or delete system configurations. For example, the command line for SCHTASKS is used to delete a task named \"spawn\", which might indicate an attempt to remove persistent malware. Additionally, there are REG DELETE commands targeting specific registry entries under HKCU, possibly removing traces of malicious software.\n\nThe repeated use of these tools and the nature of the commands suggests potential unauthorized access or malicious activity. The combination of process creations, registry modifications, and deletions points towards a possible attack where an adversary is trying to clean up their tracks or modify system behavior without detection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple processes (svchost.exe, powershell.exe) making registry changes and deleting scheduled tasks, which may indicate malicious activity attempting to remove traces.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event and see what patterns emerge.\n\nThe first few lines show process events where the name is powershell.exe or the command line is 'powershell.exe & {}'. This repetition might indicate multiple instances or scripts running PowerShell, which in itself isn't suspicious unless there's malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, I see various entries like Process accessed, Registry value set, Image loaded, and File operations. These are common for legitimate processes, especially PowerShell since it interacts with many system components.\n\nThere's a sequence where a file is created (winlog task: FileCreate) and then immediately deleted (FileDeleteDetected). This might be part of script execution or cleanup steps. However, such temporary files could also be indicators of malicious activity trying to hide traces.\n\nI notice several ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc., which are related to .NET framework components. Legitimate PowerShell scripts often load these, so this alone isn't concerning.\n\nThere's a process named conhost.exe also accessing registry values. Conhost is usually associated with console windows and isn't inherently malicious, but its activity in combination with other events could warrant closer look.\n\nThe FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 suggests a script test file was created temporarily. This might be part of policy testing or script execution. The subsequent deletion supports the idea that it's a test, but again, without context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks in the logs, which align with PowerShell's internal workings when starting up or shutting down scripts.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This seems like normal PowerShell profile initialization, but it could be part of a script that runs at startup for malicious purposes.\n\nI also see Process Create events for powershell.exe, which is standard when any process spawns another. The fact that some have command lines with '&' might indicate chaining commands or scripts, which is common in automation.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows extensive PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and loading of system libraries. While some actions could be red flags, others are entirely normal. However, the combination of creating temporary files, deleting them, modifying registry values, and loading specific DLLs might indicate script execution, which is a common technique in attacks.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because while individual events aren't suspicious, the sequence and variety suggest potentially malicious activity such as script-based attacks or persistence mechanisms. The repetition of certain tasks and the involvement of temporary files could be indicators of an attack attempting to stay undetected.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell processes creating, accessing, and deleting temporary files, along with registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or executed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated access could be suspicious. The command line in some cases shows \"& {}\", which is unusual and might indicate an attempt to execute commands or load scripts.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes: there are Process Create events for powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which makes sense if scripts are being run. But I also notice several Registry value sets by various processes, including conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. Modifying the registry can be a sign of malicious activity since it's often used to persistence or change system configurations.\n\nThe FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events for a temporary PowerShell script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1) are concerning. The creation and immediate deletion of a script file might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies, such as executing scripts that shouldn't be allowed or testing the environment's security settings.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this is normal for PowerShell execution, the specific DLLs and their paths don't seem immediately suspicious, but coupled with other activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from processes with command lines involving powershell.exe might be part of legitimate operations, but they could also be indicative of an attempt to load or unload certain components dynamically, possibly to hide traces or facilitate malicious actions.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell executions, registry modifications, creation and deletion of a script file, and provider lifecycle activities. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at testing the system's security policies or attempting unauthorized access.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe. The tasks associated with these processes include things like Registry value sets, Pipe Created, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created, and Process Create events.\n\nStarting with Calculator.exe: There's one event where it set a registry value. That seems normal unless there's something unusual about the specific registry key being modified, but without more context, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, powershell.exe appears many times. Each instance does various tasks like creating pipes, accessing processes, setting registry values, and loading images. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so multiple instances can raise flags. The command lines in some events show \"& {Remove-Item ...}\", which looks like it's trying to delete files, possibly as part of cleanup after malicious activity.\n\nChrome.exe has several events where it sets registry values. Browsers sometimes interact with the registry for settings or extensions, but repeated writes could be worth investigating if they don't align with known behavior.\n\nConhost.exe and whoami.exe also appear. Conhost is often used by scripts to host Windows console applications, which can be a red flag in certain contexts. The whoami.exe event seems straightforward, but it's another point of interest when combined with other powershell activity.\n\nI'm particularly concerned about the number of Registry value sets across multiple processes. This could indicate persistence mechanisms or changes made by malware. The file operations, like deleting files in the TEMP directory via PowerShell, suggest attempts to cover tracks.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: numerous process creations and accesses, especially with powershell.exe, along with registry modifications and file deletions. These activities can be indicative of malicious behavior, such as script execution, persistence setup, or data exfiltration efforts.\n\nWhile individual events might not raise red flags, the combination across multiple processes and repeated actions does suggest something isn't quite right. The confidence level is high because the clustering around powershell.exe and the specific command lines used are concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands, including file deletions and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a system.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's a lot of activity from `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to pay attention to. The events show powershell.exe being called with various commands, like removing files in the TEMP directory. For example, lines 1-2 have powershell.exe deleting files such as tarefa_base.zip and others. These deletions might be part of an attempt to clean up traces of previous activities or to remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where `powershell.exe` is creating temporary files in the user's AppData directory (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1). Creating and then deleting these files quickly could be a sign of script execution, possibly malicious. This might indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell to execute scripts without leaving long-term traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` loads DLLs from Windows Defender directories (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll). While Defender's components can be legitimate, loading them in the context of other suspicious activities could be a red flag. It might be an attempt to bypass detection or load malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the use of the `whoami.exe` command. This tool is often used to determine user privileges or system information, which attackers might do to escalate privileges or gather information about the environment.\n\nThere are also events involving `chrome.exe`, including registry changes and loading DLLs. While Chrome's activity can be normal, the combination with other PowerShell activities could suggest that an attacker is using multiple avenues for persistence or lateral movement within the network.\n\nThe frequency of these events over a short period (like many deletions in TEMP) might indicate a concerted effort to remove files, which is often part of a cleanup phase after malicious activity. Moreover, the repetitive pattern of deleting specific files from the TEMP directory suggests automation, possibly using a script or tool to erase evidence trails.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events involve registry changes and process creation\/access. These can be indicators of persistence mechanisms where attackers install backdoors or ensure their tools run at system startup.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell command-line activities, file deletions in TEMP, temporary file creations, loading of Defender-related DLLs, use of whoami.exe for information gathering, and registry modificationsâ€”all these factors collectively point towards potential malicious behavior. The combination suggests that an attacker might be using PowerShell to execute scripts, delete evidence, gather system info, and possibly establish persistence.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear signs of normal user activity here; instead, the patterns resemble those used in cyberattacks, such as those involving malware or script-based attacks. Therefore, this batch of logs is likely significant from a cybersecurity perspective and warrants further investigation to determine if an actual breach has occurred.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - The logs show frequent activity from `powershell.exe`, which is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Malware may abuse PowerShell for execution and persistence.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - Commands like `Remove-Item` in the TEMP directory indicate attempts to delete files. Such deletions can be part of an attacker's cleanup process to remove evidence.\n\n3. **Check for Temporary File Creation:**\n   - Powershell creates temporary files (e.g., __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1) quickly, which may suggest script execution and subsequent deletion to avoid detection.\n\n4. **Examine DLL Loading Activity:**\n   - Powershell loads Defender-related DLLs, which could be an attempt to mimic legitimate processes or load malicious components undetected.\n\n5. **Look for Information-Gathering Tools:**\n   - Use of `whoami.exe` can indicate efforts to gather system information, possibly for privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\n6. **Review Registry and Process Events:**\n   - Changes in the registry and process creation\/access events may point towards persistence mechanisms used by attackers to maintain access.\n\n7. **Assess Overall Pattern:**\n   - The repetitive nature of deletions, file creations, and other activities suggests automation, typical of malicious scripts aiming to erase traces.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits numerous indicators consistent with potential malicious activity, including misuse of PowerShell for script execution, evidence cleanup, information gathering, and possible persistence mechanisms. Given these factors, the logs are deemed significant and warrant further investigation to assess the extent of any security compromise. \n\n**Answer:** The batch is **interesting** due to signs of potential malicious activity involving Powershell and file deletions."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event shows that powershell.exe was executed with a command line argument that tries to remove a file from the TEMP directory. This could be suspicious because deleting files can be part of covering tracks or removing evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are several Image Load events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these might be normal for PowerShell execution, the fact that multiple such events occur could indicate something more complex is happening in memory.\n\nThen I see a File Created event for a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 in the TEMP directory. This file is created and then immediately deleted in another event. Creating and deleting files quickly can be a sign of malicious activity, possibly to test if certain policies are enforced or to erase evidence.\n\nThere are several Provider Lifecycle events with powershell.exe commands removing different .txt files from the TEMP directory. These could be part of legitimate script execution, but considering they're being removed and the use of Powershell, it's worth investigating whether these deletions are part of a larger attack chain.\n\nOther notable points: an event where whoami.exe is run, which might be used to check user privileges or system information. Also, there are events involving conhost.exe accessing registry values, which could be related to creating new processes in a hidden manner.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file deletions and the creation\/deletion of temporary script files raise red flags.

Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. Registry modifications can be common, especially for applications like Chrome that might tweak settings. But seeing the same event repeated 8 times makes me thinkâ€”could this be part of a normal update cycle or something more malicious? It's possible it's just standard behavior, but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nNext up is RuntimeBroker.exe also setting registry values once. Runtime Broker is related to Windows Store and app execution, so it's not unusual for it to interact with the registry. Probably nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there are a bunch of powershell.exe entriesâ€”both Process accessed and File created events. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could be concerning, especially if these accesses aren't part of normal operations. I should consider the frequency and context here.\n\nThe whoami.exe processes are creating new instances too. Whoami is typically used to check user information, which isn't inherently bad, but seeing it created so many times might indicate something like credential dumping or lateral movement within a network. This could be a red flag if not expected.\n\nLooking at the file events: winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file, and powershell.exe writes to pacote_ativo.txt. The latter's filename is in Portuguese, which translates to \"active package.\" That seems oddâ€”could it be related to malicious scripts or tracking? Without more context, it's hard to say, but the combination with other PowerShell activities raises my concern.\n\nOverall, there are several red flags: multiple instances of potentially high-risk tools (PowerShell and whoami.exe), repeated registry modifications, and a file named in a way that suggests possible malicious activity. While some events might be benign, the pattern could indicate an attack or unauthorized access. My confidence is around 0.8 because while there are concerning points, they could also be part of legitimate system activities. Still, further investigation would be wise to rule out malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe access and whoami.exe process creation alongside registry modifications and file creations suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
