{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down what each event is showing.\n\nThe first few entries are about processes being created or accessed. There's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity here. That in itself isn't unusual since PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But I need to look at the commands being run.\n\nLooking closely, one of the process events shows the command line with a script that includes several commands: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe, and others. These are system administration commands that could be used for information gathering or privilege escalation. The fact that they're chained together suggests automation, which might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then deleted in the same process. This temporary file creation and deletion can be a red flag because attackers often clean up their traces. Additionally, multiple Image Load events for various DLLs could be part of normal PowerShell operation, but combined with other suspicious activities, it raises concerns.\n\nI notice that several events have the same command line and task type \"Provider Lifecycle.\" This repetition might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times or as part of a loop, which isn't typical for legitimate scripts. The use of 'whoami.exe' early on could be to gather user information, possibly for lateral movement or privilege checks.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell execution with specific commands, temporary file handling, and repeated process creations suggests potential malicious activity. These indicators are common in attack patterns, so this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including commands for system information gathering and file manipulation, which could indicate an active threat.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe being executed with various commands. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused for malicious purposes like executing scripts or commands. The command lines here include things like net user, get-localuser, etc., which seem to be querying system information. This could be part of a routine admin task, but it's something to watch because powershell is often targeted by attackers.\n\nNext, I see several instances where processes are being created for net.exe and net1.exe with commands like \"net user\" and \"net localgroup\". These commands relate to managing users and groups on the system. If these are part of a legitimate process, they might be normal. However, repeated or unusual use could indicate an attacker trying to gather user information or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking at the file interactions, most events don't have associated files opened or accessed beyond some dlls being loaded by powershell.exe. One event shows a new .winlogbeat.yml file being created, which seems related to log management software—probably not malicious on its own.\n\nThere are multiple entries under \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\". These could be normal group policy changes or user activity. However, the frequency of these events might be worth investigating if they're outside the usual patterns for that system.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file named elemento_logico.txt by powershell.exe. The name doesn't immediately raise red flags, but creating files in arbitrary locations could be suspicious, especially if the content isn't clear.\n\nI also notice that cmdkey.exe was used with \"\/list\", which retrieves stored credentials. If an attacker gains access, they might use this command to list saved passwords or keys, so it's definitely a concerning activity.\n\nThe registry value set events on powershell.exe and conhost.exe are interesting too. Malware often uses the registry for persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to say if these changes are malicious or part of legitimate operations.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell executions with system commands, use of net\/ net1 for user\/group management, cmdkey for credentials, and registry changes—this batch shows a series of actions that could be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, even if individual events aren't overtly suspicious on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe executions with commands that query system information and user accounts, along with the use of net.exe and cmdkey.exe which can retrieve credentials. Additionally, there are registry changes and file creations that could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because RuntimeBroker is part of Windows and often interacts with the registry.\n\nNext, powershell.exe sets a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be suspicious, but it's not conclusive yet.\n\nAnother event has powershell.exe accessing something. Again, common behavior but worth keeping an eye on if there are multiple instances.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory doesn't raise any red flags. It's likely just the tool running as intended.\n\nNotepad.exe setting a registry value is unusual because Notepad typically doesn't interact with the registry much. This could be something to look into, but alone it might not be malicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a known process for services, and while it can be hijacked by malware, again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll sounds odd because Calculator usually doesn't load such system files. This could indicate tampering or malicious activity.\n\nWhoami.exe being run from the command line is interesting. It's a common tool for gathering information about the current user, often used by attackers to check permissions or privileges.\n\nOverall, there are several red flags: multiple PowerShell instances, registry modifications, and unusual file loads. While none of these alone might be suspicious, together they suggest potential malicious activity. However, without additional context like timestamps or more detailed process information, it's hard to confirm. I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the combination of events could indicate an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing and modifying registry values, which is concerning. Additionally, there's an unusual process involving whoami.exe and a potential file load by Calculator.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
