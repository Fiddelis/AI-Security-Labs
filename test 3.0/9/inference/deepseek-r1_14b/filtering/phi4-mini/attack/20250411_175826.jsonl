{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal because Chrome handles a lot of network traffic, especially when browsing the internet. So those might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen I notice several powershell.exe processes being created and accessing things like ProcessAccess and Registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused by attackers. The command lines in some events show that they're modifying LastWriteTime of specific files to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\", which looks like an attempt to set a very old timestamp. This might be part of data tampering or trying to make files look older, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1) in the user's AppData folder. Creating and then deleting scripts can be a way to hide malicious activities. It might indicate that the script was executed and then removed to erase traces.\n\nOther events show notepad.exe accessing registry values, which is unusual because Notepad typically doesn't interact with the registry. Also, RuntimeBroker.exe modifying registry values could be concerning if it's doing something unexpected outside its normal operations.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle tasks from different command lines that all involve setting LastWriteTime to 1970. This seems repetitive and possibly automated, which might indicate some script or tool running to modify file timestamps across various files. The pattern suggests a concerted effort to alter file metadata, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands, file timestamp modifications, temporary script creation\/deletion, and unexpected registry accesses by non-standard processes like notepad.exe are red flags. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate malicious intent such as persistence, data exfiltration, or covering tracks.\n\nTherefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation because it exhibits several suspicious patterns indicative of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"isInteresting\": true,\n    \"reasoning\": [\n      \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with command lines modifying file timestamps suggest possible tampering or persistence.\",\n      \"Creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.\",\n      \"Registry accesses by non-standard processes like notepad.exe could be signs of unauthorized activity.\",\n      \"Repetitive Provider Lifecycle tasks altering file metadata might be part of a script's efforts to obscure its tracks.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that involve changing LastWriteTime on various files. This caught my attention because PowerShell can be a tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Changing file timestamps could be part of data tampering or an attempt to cover tracks by making logs look older or newer than they are.\n\nLooking further, I see several instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Svchost.exe is typically used by system services, but it's also commonly associated with malware because many malicious processes run under this name. The fact that it's modifying the registry could indicate something suspicious, like installing persistence mechanisms or altering configuration settings.\n\nAnother point is the number of events where chrome.exe is involved. While Chrome itself isn't inherently malicious, the high frequency of Registry value sets might be unusual unless there's a specific extension or plugin causing this activity. It's worth checking if these are normal operations for the browser or part of a larger pattern.\n\nI also notice two entries related to winlogbeat.exe creating files in a data directory. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool used for collecting and forwarding logs, so its presence isn't alarming on its own. However, seeing it create a .new file might indicate some configuration changes or updates, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is concerning.\n\nThere are events where processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe are modifying registry values. These are standard system processes; however, any unexpected registry activity from them could be worth looking into for potential tampering or unwanted behavior.\n\nThe one event with conhost.exe accessing the registry stands out a bit too. Conhost is used for console hosting in Windows, but its interaction with the registry might not be common, so it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags: PowerShell command line activities that could indicate tampering, svchost.exe making registry changes which might suggest persistence or malicious activity, and multiple chrome.exe events possibly indicating unusual behavior. While individually some of these might be normal, the combination and frequency, especially with processes like svchost.exe and powershell.exe, make me think this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe modifying file timestamps, which may indicate data tampering or malicious activity. Additionally, svchost.exe registry modifications and numerous chrome.exe events suggest potential suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here.\n\nThe first event involves powershell.exe creating a file called unidade_logico.txt in the user's Downloads folder. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Creating files could be part of some script execution or data exfiltration. But I need to see more context to know if this is normal behavior.\n\nThen, there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. Seven times in a row, the same task is logged: Registry value set. Chrome doing registry changes isn't unusual since it might be tweaking settings. However, seven instances of the same event in quick succession could indicate something suspicious, like an attempt to modify configurations for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nPutting them together, I'm thinking about potential indicators of compromise (IOC). The powershell.exe activity is a red flag, but sometimes admins use PowerShell legitimately too. But combined with multiple registry changes from chrome.exe, it raises questions. Maybe the attacker used Chrome for some actions and PowerShell to execute commands or drop files.\n\nI should consider if these activities are within normal user behavior. Regular users don't typically run scripts in powershell.exe that create specific files, especially without user interaction. And while Chrome does make registry changes, doing so repeatedly might be a sign of tampering.\n\nAnother angle is whether there's any correlation between the events. For example, if the file created by PowerShell is part of a larger script execution, and the registry changes are setting up persistence mechanisms, that would definitely be concerning.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of powershell.exe file creation and repeated chrome.exe registry modifications could indicate malicious activity. However, without more context or additional events showing other suspicious behaviors, my confidence isn't 100%, but it's high enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a combination of events: one instance of 'powershell.exe' creating a file and multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' making registry changes. This could indicate potential malicious activity, such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
