Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups as part of its operation. Not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused for malicious activities. However, in this batch, it's accessed without any unusual command-line arguments, so maybe just normal usage or script execution.\n\nLooking further, calc.exe is involved, but it's a standard calculator application. Its involvement with URLMON.DLL could be a red herring since it's a legitimate system file. No malicious intent here obvious.\n\nI notice several schtasks.exe entries creating tasks using cmd.exe to run calc.exe. Scheduling tasks on startup or logon isn't inherently bad, but if the task is executing calc.exe as part of its command, that might be suspicious, especially in multiple variations with different names like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\". This could indicate persistence mechanisms where malicious actors set up tasks to run at system startup.\n\nThere are also multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and cmd.exe. Svchost is a legitimate process but often used by malware because it's a common service host.频繁的registry操作可能表明有恶意软件试图持久化或改变系统配置。\n\nFurthermore, there are entries where svchost.exe creates files in the Tasks directory, which is where Windows stores scheduled tasks. Creating new task files could be part of setting up persistence.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of different task names with similar patterns (e.g., \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\"). This suggests a methodical approach to creating multiple tasks, possibly to ensure that at least one will execute even if some are detected or removed. This behavior is often seen in more sophisticated malware aiming for persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there's a cmd.exe command line that creates a scheduled task executing calc.exe upon logon and startup. While calc.exe itself isn't malicious, the way it's being scheduled by an elevated user (system) could be part of a larger attack vector, allowing persistent access or payload delivery.\n\nPutting all this together, the combination of multiple schtasks.exe calls, registry modifications, and file creations in system directories by various processes points to potential malicious activity. The use of different task names and the creation of tasks that run at startup\/logon are strong indicators of persistence mechanisms commonly used by attackers.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple schtasks.exe calls creating persistent tasks using cmd.exe to execute calc.exe, along with numerous registry modifications and file creations in system directories by svchost.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, all are from chrome.exe with tasks like \"Pipe Created\" and multiple \"Registry value set\" events. That seems normal because Chrome interacts with system services and might access registry keys regularly. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so creating configuration files isn't unusual. Moving on, I see that powershell.exe creates a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for attacks. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nNext, there are more chrome.exe events accessing registry values and loading system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These seem standard as Chrome would interact with these components. However, the repeated RegistryEvent accesses could be a sign of something more, though without context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen I notice two whoami.exe processes being created. Whoami is typically used to display user information, often used in scripts or debugging. It's not inherently malicious, but its use can sometimes indicate privilege escalation if run with higher permissions.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe accessing a process again might be checking for something or invoking another script. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, it's hard to classify this as suspicious without more context.\n\nConsidering all events together, the batch includes normal activities like browser operations, log file creation, and legitimate tool usage. While some actions could potentially be malicious if part of a larger campaign, individually they don't provide enough evidence. There's no clear indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as browser operations, log file creation, and legitimate tool usage without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
