{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used for scripting but can also be a red flag because it's often exploited in attacks. The command lines look like they're creating scheduled tasks using New-ScheduledTask and Register-ScheduledTask. The commands are trying to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges, which seems suspicious. Typically, attackers would use such scripts to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking at the event types, there are 'Provider Lifecycle' events, which might be related to task scheduler activities. Then there's a mix of other events like Registry value sets and Process accesses, which could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or gather information.\n\nI also see that some powershell.exe instances are loading various DLLs, including MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is normal but could be an attempt to bypass detection if malicious. There's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1 and then deleted. This temporary script creation and deletion might suggest that someone is testing the system's PowerShell policies or trying to run something without leaving evidence, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to Registry modifications and process accesses. These activities can be part of installing backdoors or creating persistent malicious tasks. The repeated use of powershell.exe with these specific commands across multiple entries makes me think it's not just a single action but part of a campaign.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activity: creating high-privilege scheduled tasks, registry modifications, loading modules, and temporary file handling. These are all hallmarks of attack behaviors rather than normal user activities. Therefore, this batch should definitely be investigated further for potential security breaches.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several indicators of potential malicious activity, suggesting that a cybersecurity investigation is warranted.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activity:** The repeated execution of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments indicates possible exploitation. The script attempts to create scheduled tasks (New-ScheduledTask and Register-ScheduledTask) with high privileges, which is often used by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n2. **File and Registry Actions:** Events involving file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and registry modifications suggest efforts to modify system configurations or hide traces of malicious activities.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:** Powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, might indicate attempts to bypass security mechanisms.\n\n4. **Temporary Script Handling:** The creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file could be part of an attack to test system policies or avoid detection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the combination of suspicious activities such as creating high-privilege tasks, registry modifications, and handling temporary scripts, this batch indicates potential malicious behavior. An investigation is necessary to assess the extent of any compromise and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice two events where powershell.exe is being used with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The commands are creating tasks named 'estrutura_auxiliar' and 'unidade_comum'. These tasks execute calc.exe at logon, run as Administrators with highest privileges. This seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with such elevated rights can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying the registry (Registry value set). This could be normal if chrome is updating settings, but it's worth noting that several such events occur, which might indicate some unusual behavior beyond regular updates.\n\nLooking further, I see repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks. These appear 14 times and come from None process, which is odd. The fact that they're happening so frequently could be an indication of a possible remote attack or unauthorized command execution attempts.\n\nThere's also an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll. WMI can be used for malicious activities, especially if combined with other suspicious actions like creating scheduled tasks. Additionally, svchost.exe modifying the registry and file creation in the Task directory could be part of a broader attack vector.\n\nAnother event has powershell.exe creating files in user-specific directories (AppData), which might be to store configuration or persistence mechanisms. This is concerning because it's accessing sensitive areas that scripts typically don't modify unless they have specific intentions.\n\nConhost.exe also modifies the registry, and while conhost is a legitimate process, any unexpected registry changes could indicate tampering.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating its own config file isn't alarming on its own, but when combined with other suspicious events, it might be part of an attacker's toolset to log data or exfiltrate information.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated powershell command lines setting up malicious tasks, numerous remote command executions, and multiple registry modifications across different processes raise red flags. These activities don't seem like normal user behavior and could indicate a coordinated attack attempting persistence and privilege escalation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activity including powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, multiple registry modifications, repeated remote command executions, and file creations in user directories. These actions suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first six events all come from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome often adjusts settings via the registry. The fact that it happens multiple times in a row might be a bit unusual, but not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe makes a DNS query. Again, this is typical for web browsers accessing websites, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creates a new file. Winlogbeat is used for collecting Windows logs, so it's expected that it writes configuration files. The path mentioned looks legitimate too.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe creates a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt. Powershell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities. However, creating a file isn't inherently maliciousâ€”it could be part of a script or legitimate work. Without more context, like the content of the file or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are normal system behaviors. While powershell.exe is a red flag in some contexts, there's not enough evidence here to suggest malicious activity. The confidence level isn't very high because one event could be concerning, but without more info, the batch as a whole doesn't raise significant flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as registry modifications by Chrome, DNS queries, and file creations by legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. There is no indication of malicious behavior in the provided batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
