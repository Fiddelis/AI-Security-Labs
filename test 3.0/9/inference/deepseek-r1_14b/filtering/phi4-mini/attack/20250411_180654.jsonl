{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, they're all JSONL entries, each representing an event on a Windows system. Each line has three main parts: process information, winlog (which seems to be Windows log task), and file details.\n\nI see that most of the early events involve 'chrome.exe' modifying registry values. That's common because Chrome often adjusts settings through the registry. But then I notice 'whoami.exe' being run with a command line that just says \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". Usually, whoami is used to get user information, and running it without extra parameters isn't suspicious in itself.\n\nThen there are several events where 'powershell.exe' creates files. For example, one event shows the creation of 'objeto_temporario.txt' in a user's Downloads folder. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The command line here seems to invoke a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which immediately raises a red flag because that sounds like it could be designed to capture keystrokes or other malicious activities.\n\nI see multiple instances where 'powershell.exe' is running scripts with paths like \"C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\estrutura_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". The fact that the same script path appears multiple times suggests it's being executed several times, possibly as part of a loop or repeated execution. This repetition could indicate an attempt to stay persistent or to run malicious code multiple times.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion events for '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1' in the user's Temp directory. Creating and then deleting a script file can be part of checking if certain policies are enforced, like whether scripts downloaded from the internet are allowed to run. This behavior is often seen during initial access or lateral movement by attackers to test defenses.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where 'powershell.exe' loads various DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll, which might be normal for PowerShell as it's .NET-based. However, combined with the execution of external scripts, this could indicate malicious activity trying to load modules or execute code under the cover of legitimate processes.\n\nLooking at the later events marked as 'Provider Lifecycle', these are more generic events related to Windows Defender or other system services, so probably not relevant to the main issue here.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated use of PowerShell to run a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which sounds malicious; file creation and deletion in Temp directory for potential policy testing; and multiple instances of these actions suggest possible persistence or attack. While some events are normal (like Chrome registry changes), the pattern around PowerShell and the specific script name make me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nI should also consider if there's any indication of data exfiltration or communication with external servers, but those details aren't in these logs. Still, the combination of events is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits characteristics indicative of potential malicious activity, particularly involving PowerShell execution and file manipulation. Key points include:\n\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Execution**: Multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' running scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggest possible malicious intent, as such scripts may be designed for keystroke logging or other harmful purposes.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: The creation and subsequent deletion of a script in the Temp directory could indicate attempts to bypass policy restrictions, commonly seen during initial access or lateral movement by attackers.\n\n3. **Command-Line Details**: The command lines show consistent paths to external scripts, suggesting repeated execution, which may be part of an attack strategy for persistence or continuous malicious activity.\n\nWhile some events (e.g., Chrome registry modifications) are benign, the overall pattern around PowerShell and specific file activities raises concerns. This warrants further investigation to assess potential threats and采取 appropriate security measures. \n\n**Conclusion:** The batch is considered **interesting and potentially suspicious**, requiring closer examination to determine if it indicates a cybersecurity incident."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that reference Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. These scripts are typically used to log keystrokes, which is a red flag because such activities can be associated with keyloggers—often malicious in nature. The fact that there are two different paths for these scripts suggests possible multiple instances or variations of the same script being run.\n\nNext, looking at the file events, powershell.exe is creating files in various locations like TEMP directories and user-specific PowerShell profile data. This activity might be part of setting up persistence or logging keystrokes over time. The creation of these files could indicate that the script is attempting to write logs without proper authorization.\n\nThere's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) component used for log management. However, in this context, it's creating a configuration file (.winlogbeat.yml.new). While this could be legitimate, especially if the system is using winlogbeat for logging, the presence alongside suspicious powershell.exe activities might warrant closer examination to ensure it's not being misused.\n\nThe events involving conhost.exe and svchost.exe are interesting too. Conhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by PowerShell to host console windows. Its appearance here isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, but combined with the other events, it adds to the narrative of potentially malicious activity. Svchost.exe is also a common system process that can be exploited by malware, so any unusual file creation from this process should be flagged.\n\nI'm concerned about the repeated file creations in different locations, especially under user profiles and service directories. This could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or spread across the system. The NetworkService profile's involvement is also worth noting because it has access to network resources, which might be useful for exfiltration of stolen data if this were a keylogger.\n\nThe events don't show any direct signs of communication with external servers or known malicious domains, but the combination of activities—executing scripts meant for keystroke logging, creating multiple log files in various locations, and using legitimate tools like winlogbeat for potential data exfiltration—paints a concerning picture. While I can't confirm without deeper analysis, the pattern strongly suggests possible malicious intent.\n\nIn summary, the batch includes several red flags: execution of keylogger scripts via PowerShell, file creation activities that could be part of persistence or logging, and use of legitimate tools in ways that might indicate misuse. The consistency across events points to a potential security issue that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which are often associated with keylogging activities.
