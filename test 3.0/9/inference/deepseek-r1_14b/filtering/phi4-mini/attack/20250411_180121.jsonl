{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm seeing multiple entries from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe.\n\nFirst, the Chrome processes are showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal for a browser, especially if it's accessing websites. But then there are several Registry value set tasks. While some registry activity is expected, multiple writes in a short time could be suspicious, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, looking at PowerShell, that's a red flag because attackers often use it for command execution and file downloads. The command lines show the powershell.exe downloading files from various GitHub repositories. The URLs are pointing to LICENSE.txt files, which is odd because that's typically part of software distribution. However, in this context, it's unusual for a script to be downloading such files repeatedly.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where PowerShell creates temporary files and then deletes them shortly after. This behavior can indicate an attempt to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces on the system. The fact that each download is from a different GitHub path adds more concern—attackers might be trying to fetch different components or modules without raising immediate suspicion.\n\nThe process accesses, image loads, and pipe creation further suggest that something is being executed in memory or attempting to run scripts. Combined with the file creations and deletions, it looks like there's active code execution happening, which could be part of a larger malicious payload.\n\nOverall, while some events on their own might not seem too alarming, the combination—especially the repeated PowerShell downloads from different repositories and the temporary file handling—is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub and creating\/deleting temporary files indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first three events, they all involve chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't modify system-wide registry settings unless it's part of an update or extension. But since it's repeated three times, I wonder if this is normal behavior for the user or if it's a sign of something malicious.\n\nNext, there are events from powershell.exe. One event shows that PowerShell downloaded a file from GitHub using a WebClient object. This could be suspicious because downloading files directly from raw.githubusercontent.com might indicate script execution or data exfiltration. The command line has \"& { (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(...\", which is a common way to execute arbitrary scripts.\n\nAnother event shows that powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData directory, which is non-standard and could be used for persistence. There are also multiple events where powershell.exe sets registry values and accesses processes, which might indicate it's trying to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThere's an event with conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is often used in command-line tools, but any unusual activity here should be flagged because it could be a sign of malicious scripts running in the background.\n\nLooking at the winlogbeat.exe events, they are creating files related to their configuration. This seems normal unless the file paths or contents are suspicious, which they don't seem to be based on the information provided.\n\nMpDefenderCoreService.exe is part of Windows Defender, and seeing it log a network connection might just be standard activity as it scans for threats online.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe also sets a registry value. Again, unless this is known behavior, it's worth monitoring but not immediately concerning.\n\nsvchost.exe events setting registry values are common since svchost runs various services, so this alone isn't alarming, but in combination with other suspicious activities, it could raise flags.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution seems benign as it's a common command to check user information. However, if used in conjunction with other commands, it might be part of a larger malicious script.\n\ncmd.exe events show SCHTASKS being used to delete a task named \"spawn\". This is concerning because deleting scheduled tasks can be part of an attempt to remove traces or disable security measures. The use of >nul 2>&1 suggests the command was executed without any output, which is typical for hiding activity in command-line scripts.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from a GitHub repo, creating startup files, accessing processes, and registry modifications; conhost and cmd.exe performing suspicious actions like deleting tasks. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The confidence level is high because several red flags align with common attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from a GitHub repository, creating files in non-standard locations, and using commands to delete scheduled tasks suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of events here, all in JSONL format. Each line represents an event with some process information, a Windows log task, and possibly a file path.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first few events involve 'schtasks.exe' being used to delete a scheduled task named 'spawn'. That seems suspicious because deleting tasks can be part of malicious activities like removing traces or preventing analysis.\n\nNext, there are several instances where 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', and 'whoami.exe' are executed. Using these tools isn't inherently bad, but the command lines associated with them might be concerning. For example, the cmd.exe is used to delete registry entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for values like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". This looks like an attempt to remove entries that might be part of persistence mechanisms or tracking.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity with 'powershell.exe'. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers. The events show it being accessed multiple times, which could indicate script execution. Notably, some command lines are \"& {}\", which seems unusual and possibly an attempt to execute commands without logging them clearly or using obfuscation techniques.\n\nThere are also several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal, but combined with the other activity, it raises questions about what scripts are being run. Additionally, there are ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe, which might indicate that another process is interacting with it, possibly injecting code or monitoring its execution.\n\nThe repeated use of 'reg.exe' to delete registry entries and processes like conhost.exe modifying the registry further suggests a pattern of system configuration changes. These actions could be part of an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity or establish persistence across reboots.\n\nPutting all this together, I notice multiple instances where system tools are being used in ways that might indicate a breach. The combination of deleting scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, and extensive powershell usage with unclear command lines is a red flag. These behaviors often correlate with post-exploitation activities by attackers to maintain access and cover their tracks.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows signs of potential malicious activity. However, without more context or additional indicators like timestamps or user information, the confidence isn't 100%. But given the pattern of events, it's definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including deletion of scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and extensive PowerShell usage with potentially obfuscated commands, indicating possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst off, I see a lot of PowerShell activity. That's not unusual because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But the number of events here might be a red flag. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running scripts or being invoked with \"& {}\". This could indicate script execution, which is something to watch out for.\n\nLooking at the file paths mentioned, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1, it seems like temporary files are being created and then deleted quickly. The creation and deletion of temporary files can be part of malicious activities to avoid detection or to clean up traces.\n\nThere's also file operations related to MpOAV.dll in the Windows Defender directory. That could be suspicious because an attacker might try to replace or modify legitimate system files to hide their actions or gain persistence.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe and cmd.exe with command lines that look like they're executing other commands. Conhost is often used as a host process for other executables, which can sometimes be part of obfuscating malicious activities.\n\nThe events involving registry value sets are also noteworthy. Attackers frequently modify the Windows Registry to achieve persistence or change system configurations without being detected easily.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these actions might also be part of normal system operations. For example, PowerShell is often used for system administration tasks, and temporary files can be created by various applications. But the combination here—multiple script creations\/deletions, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell invocations with \"& {}\"—seems more indicative of potential malicious behavior rather than standard operations.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events showing process creations and accesses, which could be part of a process injection technique or lateral movement within a network. The repetition of these actions might suggest an automated script running, possibly for persistence or to avoid detection mechanisms.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the pattern of activities aligns with common tactics used in cyberattacks, such as using legitimate tools maliciously, creating temporary files, modifying system configurations, and hiding processes. The high frequency of these events involving PowerShell and related system changes increases my confidence that there might be something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions, file operations in temporary directories, registry modifications, and rapid file deletions, which may indicate malicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the events are related to powershell.exe activities. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The fact that there are multiple entries showing file creations and deletions in temporary directories could indicate script execution or testing behavior.\n\nLooking at the specific actions: there's a file being created and then immediately deleted. This pattern, especially when coupled with command lines that obfuscate or remove files (like Remove-Item), is a red flag because attackers often try to clean up traces of their activities.\n\nAdditionally, several events show registry value modifications. This is concerning because changing registry entries can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it starts on system reboot.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe execution might be an attempt to gather user information or privileges. Although whoami itself isn't malicious, its use alongside other suspicious activities could indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement within a network.\n\nMoreover, the repeated ImageLoad events for different DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll suggest that powershell.exe is loading various modules, which might be legitimate but could also be a way to load malicious payloads under the guise of system processes.\n\nConsidering the combination of these activities—file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and multiple process creations—it's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell for execution or lateral movement. The frequency and specific actions taken make this batch of logs stand out as potentially indicative of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe activities, including file creation\/deletion in temp directories and registry modifications, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events. I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell.exe processes here, which immediately raises my antenna because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading images and accessing files. For example, one event shows it loading mscorlib.ni.dll from a NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64 directory—this seems normal for .NET framework usage, but I can't rule out anything suspicious yet.\n\nThen, I notice that there's a file being created in the user's temporary folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. PowerShell script creation in temp directories is a red flag because attackers often use such scripts to execute malicious code temporarily. The fact that this file is later deleted adds another layer—maybe it was part of some automated cleanup, but it could also indicate an attempt to erase evidence.\n\nThere's a series of events where powershell.exe is removing files from the TEMP directory using Remove-Item. The paths being deleted include various .zip and .txt files with names like tarefa_base.zip or estrutura_geral.zip. This pattern seems too consistent. Why would someone delete multiple files in the temp folder? It could be part of a cleanup routine, but more concerning is that it might be an attempt to remove traces of previous activities, possibly malicious.\n\nAnother point that stands out is the use of \"&\" in the command lines, like \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item...}\". This syntax can be used to execute multiple commands within a single PowerShell instance, which is common in scripts. However, when combined with deleting files from the temp directory, it might suggest an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence of prior malicious actions.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was executed. While this tool is often used for legitimate purposes to check user information, its execution alongside other PowerShell activities could be part of gathering system info for later use in attacks.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the creation and deletion of temporary script files, multiple file deletions from the temp directory using PowerShell, and the use of command-line techniques—I'm leaning towards this batch being indicative of malicious activity. The repetitive pattern of deleting various files is particularly concerning, as it doesn't align with typical user behavior and seems more aligned with a cleanup routine by malware.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if all these actions are definitively malicious without more context, but the combination raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity:**\n   - The logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` processes, which is notable due to PowerShell's dual use in both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\n2. **Analyze File Operations:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1`) is created and later deleted. This behavior can be suspicious, especially when combined with other actions.\n   \n3. **Examine Deletion Patterns:**\n   - Several events show `powershell.exe` deleting files from the TEMP directory, such as `.zip` and `.txt` files. The consistent deletion of various files raises concerns about evidence destruction.\n\n4. **Look for Command-Line Techniques:**\n   - Use of \"&\" in command lines to execute multiple commands hints at script execution, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\n5. **Consider Contextual Evidence:**\n   - Execution of `whoami.exe` alongside PowerShell activities could be part of system information gathering, a common step in early attack stages.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of temporary file creation\/deletion, repetitive deletions from the TEMP directory using PowerShell, and command-line techniques suggests potential malicious activity. While not definitive without further context, these actions warrant investigation due to their suspicious nature. \n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Suspicious activities detected; investigation recommended}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe activity. That immediately raises some flags because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, especially in attacks like phishing or ransomware.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged: there are multiple instances where files are being created and then deleted in temporary directories. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. This kind of activity can be a red flag because attackers might create malicious scripts temporarily to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a series of events where specific files in the TEMP directory are being removed using PowerShell commands, like Remove-Item. The fact that multiple files with different names (registro_auxiliar.txt, registro_comum.txt, etc.) are being deleted suggests some automated process or script is running, possibly trying to clean up traces of its activity.\n\nAnother point of interest is the use of Registry value sets and Image loads in PowerShell. Malware often interacts with the Windows Registry to persistence or modify system configurations. The loaded images include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, which are related to .NET Framework, but sometimes these can be exploited by malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. While this command itself isn't malicious, it could be used to gather information about the system, potentially as part of a reconnaissance phase before more serious attacks.\n\nThe fact that multiple Registry events are logged from both PowerShell and Chrome.exe is also worth noting. While Chrome might have legitimate reasons for modifying the registry (e.g., extensions or settings), unusual activity here could indicate tampering.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several suspicious activities: temporary file creation\/deletion, multiple Registry modifications, script execution attempts, and persistence mechanisms. These behaviors are often indicative of malicious intent, especially when combined with tools like PowerShell which can be used to hide or obfuscate such actions.\n\nHowever, there's also some benign activity, like the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of log management and not malicious. But given the overall pattern, the malicious indicators outweigh the legitimate ones.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because it exhibits behaviors that are consistent with potential malicious activities, such as script-based file manipulation, Registry modifications, and process creation from PowerShell.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including temporary file creation\/deletion, Registry modifications, and whoami.exe execution, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\n1. The first few entries are from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal because browsers often interact with the registry for settings and configurations.\n2. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe doing the same thing—setting a registry value. Again, that's probably standard activity since RuntimeBroker is related to Windows services.\n3. Next up, whoami.exe is being executed. Whoami is a common system utility used to display information about the current user. It's often used in scripts or by users checking their permissions, so it doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n4. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessed and some processes are created with whoami.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, like executing commands or scripts. However, in this case, the events show 'Process Create' and 'Registry value set', which could be part of normal operations but might also indicate command execution.\n5. Looking at the last two events: winlogbeat.exe creates a file related to its data directory, which is expected behavior for log shipping tools like WinlogBeat. Then powershell.exe creates a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename doesn't immediately seem suspicious, but creating files with PowerShell could be part of malicious activity, such as dropping malware or establishing persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch includes several instances where known legitimate processes are performing normal operations, like chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe interacting with the registry. However, there's a significant number of powershell.exe events, which is notable because of its potential for abuse. The creation of files by PowerShell adds some concern, as this could be part of malicious script execution or data exfiltration.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe is being used multiple times, which might not be suspicious on its own but could be part of a larger sequence of actions. Additionally, the final event shows a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' being created by PowerShell, which might suggest some activity related to Brazilian Portuguese (\"pacote\" means package). This could be an attempt to create a specific file for further operations.\n\nConsidering all these points, while most events are within normal operational parameters, the repeated use of powershell.exe and the creation of files are concerning. These actions could indicate potential malicious behavior or attempts at persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances and file creations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
