{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. The command lines in some of these events look suspicious too. They include commands like adding system types and capturing screen shots. For example, one event has a command line that creates a bitmap of the screen and saves it as an image file in TEMP. That's concerning because screen capture scripts can be part of malware trying to gather sensitive information.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs. This could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or load malicious components. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands that don't seem like normal user activity raises the alarm.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event with whoami.exe being run. While this command can be legitimate for checking user permissions, in the context of multiple PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger script to gather information about the system, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThe fact that some events have \"Provider Lifecycle\" as the task could indicate that something is trying to manage event providers, which might be an attempt to disable logging or hide activities. This is another layer of concern because attackers often try to cover their tracks by manipulating logs.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with specific scripts, screen captures, registry modifications, and potential log tampering suggests a high likelihood of malicious activity. The repetitive nature of these events over several entries strengthens the case that this batch is not just random noise but part of a coordinated attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with suspicious command lines attempting screen capture and registry modifications, along with other potentially malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events all involve powershell.exe with command lines that look like they're taking screenshots. They're saving images to the TEMP directory with names like estrutura_ativo.png, modulo_principal.png, etc. That seems suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when combined with screen capturing which could be part of a remote access tool or ransomware.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe creates and deletes a file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1) in the Temp folder. Creating and then deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection, which is a red flag for malware activity.\n\nThere's also an event where a remote command is executed. Remote commands can be part of command-and-control (C2) communication, which is a key indicator of malicious behavior.\n\nOther events show powershell.exe accessing registry values and loading certain DLLs. Registry modifications are common in attacks to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nLooking at other processes like conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, etc., performing registry writes could be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with the PowerShell activities, it raises concern. For instance, if these processes are being used as part of a broader attack, their actions might be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and isn't inherently malicious, but if it's part of the attack chain, that could be another layer to investigate.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated PowerShell executions with screenshot captures, file creation\/deletion in Temp, remote command execution, registry modifications by multiple processes, including Calculator.exe which is a common default user account used in attacks. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity such as screen recording for exfiltration of sensitive data, persistence mechanisms through registry changes, and possible lateral movement or C2 communication.\n\nI should consider the confidence level. While each event could be benign on its own, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, file operations, remote commands, and registry writes across different processes strongly points to malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including screen capturing, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and remote command execution. Combined with registry modifications and other processes like Calculator.exe modifying the registry, these indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence, data exfiltration, or command-and-control communication.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I see that all the events are related to the Chrome.exe process. The activities include registry value sets, DNS queries, and loading various DLLs.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events (around 6 out of 10) are about setting registry values. This is a common activity for legitimate software like Chrome, which often adjusts settings during runtime. However, malicious actors might also use registry modifications to persist or alter system configurations, so it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nThere's one DNS query event. Legitimate processes do perform DNS lookups all the time, especially browsers like Chrome when navigating to websites. Without more context about the queried domain, it's hard to say if this is suspicious. It could be part of normal browsing behavior.\n\nThen there are two ImageLoad events loading specific DLLs: amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface, which is standard for applications to integrate with antivirus software. MpOAV.dll seems to be from Windows Defender's Platform, which also sounds legitimate. These loads are expected as part of Chrome's operation, especially if it's interacting with system security components.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the actions don't seem out of the ordinary. They align with what a running instance of Chrome would typically doâ€”modifying registry settings, performing DNS queries for web navigation, and loading necessary system libraries. There's no evidence here of unusual activity such as accessing restricted files, multiple failed login attempts, or known malicious process spawning.\n\nHowever, since all events come from the same process (Chrome.exe), it's essential to consider whether this is within the baseline of normal behavior for that application. If Chrome typically performs these actions frequently, then this batch might not raise any red flags. But if such events are uncommon or follow an unusual pattern, they could warrant closer inspection.\n\nIn conclusion, while each individual action isn't inherently suspicious, collectively they don't indicate malicious behavior based on the provided data. Therefore, this batch is likely not interesting for further investigation without additional context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal Chrome.exe activities such as registry modifications, DNS queries, and loading standard system DLLs, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
