{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this step by step. I've got a batch of 14 events from system logs, and my task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first six entries, each shows a PowerShell process creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe on startup. The command lines are all similar but with different names ending in $object when registering the task. This pattern suggests an attempt to create multiple persistent tasks, which could be part of a persistence mechanism used by malware. Using BUILTIN\\Administrators and RunLevel Highest is also concerning because it indicates high privileges, which isn't typical for standard user activities.\n\nThen, entries 7 through 14 involve various events from PowerShell.exe accessing registry keys, loading images, and some process creations. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might be part of setting up the malicious configuration or persistence points. The image loads are normal when using .NET frameworks in PowerShell but could also mask malicious activity if they're part of a broader attack.\n\nThe fact that these events all involve PowerShell is a red flag because it's commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, especially when combined with creating scheduled tasks and registry modifications. The consistency across the events—multiple task creations with similar patterns—indicates a potential coordinated effort rather than random activity.\n\nHowever, without additional context like timestamps or process trees showing how these processes relate to each other, it's harder to be certain. But given the high number of suspicious actions (creating multiple scheduled tasks, registry access), I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm seeing a series of events that stand out to me as potentially malicious.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is being executed with some command lines that look suspicious. For example, the command line includes creating scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`. The commands are trying to run calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges, which is a red flag because legitimate scripts usually don't need such high-level access.\n\nThen there's the file activity: PowerShell creates temporary files in the user's AppData folder. It creates, loads, and then deletes these files. This seems like an attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself quickly, or maybe it's part of some persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking at the registry changes from chrome.exe, even though Chrome isn't usually associated with malicious activity, multiple registry writes in a short time could indicate tampering. It might be setting up some kind of persistence or altering system configurations to allow other processes to run without user consent.\n\nThe kicker is the batch of events where nothing is executing except remote commands. These are probably indicators of a remote attack vector, like an RDP session or a remote exploit tool being used to execute commands on the machine. This could mean unauthorized access or a potential backdoor being established.\n\nPutting it all together: PowerShell scripting with elevated privileges, file manipulations in temp directories, registry tweaks from non-standard apps, and remote command executions. These are all classic signs of malicious activity. The volume and combination suggest a coordinated attack rather than unrelated incidents. It looks like an attacker is trying to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and possibly move laterally within the network.\n\nSo, yeah, this batch definitely needs a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show suspicious PowerShell activity including creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe with elevated privileges. There are multiple file creation and deletion actions in temporary directories, which may indicate an attempt to evade detection or persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an entry where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll. That seems normal because WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and typically handles legitimate tasks. But I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, multiple entries show svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common system process, often associated with services like rundll32 or others. Seeing it modify the registry isn't unusual unless there are multiple such events without any other signs of compromise.\n\nThen, another svchost.exe event creates a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks. The filename 'unidade_comum' translates to 'common unit', which doesn't immediately raise red flags, but I should check if this is part of known legitimate activity or not.\n\nThere's an entry where a remote command is executed without any associated process. That could be suspicious because executing commands remotely might indicate malicious activity, especially if there's no clear reason for it in the logs.\n\nPowershell.exe creating files and modifying registry values catches my attention. Powershell is commonly used by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. However, legitimate admins also use it, so I need context. The specific paths mentioned don't seem immediately suspicious, but repeated usage might warrant closer look.\n\nConhost.exe setting a registry value isn't alarming on its own since conhost is related to console services. But again, multiple events could be concerning.\n\nChrome.exe has several entries, mostly image loads and registry modifications. Chrome often loads various DLLs and interacts with the registry for settings. The specific paths like amsi.dll are legitimate anti-malware components, so that's normal. However, multiple registry writes might indicate something else, but it's hard to tell without more context.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files seems benign since it's an agent used for log management. The path mentioned is standard for its configuration files.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there are a lot of registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, which might seem unusual but could also be part of normal system operations. The remote command execution without process info stands out as potential malicious activity. Powershell's actions are more concerning because it's often used in attacks.\n\nI'm on the fence here. While some events individually look suspicious, collectively they don't clearly point to a breach or active attack. Without additional context or evidence of known malicious patterns, I might lean towards not being immediately interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple entries involving svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files, powershell.exe performing file operations, and a remote command execution without an associated process. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
