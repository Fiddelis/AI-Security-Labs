So, the user provided a batch of events in JSONL format and asked for a classification as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with justification and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening. The first few events are from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That's normal because Chrome makes lots of network requests and DNS lookups when browsing the web. Nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nThen, there's a process creation for powershell.exe with a command line that includes downloading files from various GitHub repositories. This caught my attention because PowerShell is often used in scripting and can be a red flag if it's executing arbitrary code downloaded from the internet. The URLs point to raw.githubusercontent.com, which hosts code files, so this script might be downloading something malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses registry values, loads images, creates files, and then deletes them. This sequence is concerning because creating files in temporary directories and deleting them can be part of an attempt to hide malicious activities or clean up after executing a payload. The repeated file operations might indicate that the script is trying different approaches to execute code or move laterally within the system.\n\nI also notice several \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe, which might mean that some services or components are being loaded or unloaded. This could be part of normal operation, but in combination with the other activities, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these together, the batch shows a series of actions that are indicative of potentially malicious behavior. The use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub, coupled with file creation and deletion, suggests possible script execution for不良 purposes like downloading malware or establishing persistence.\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% certain because some activities could be legitimate, especially if the user is running scripts intentionally. But given the repetitive nature of these events and the use of known malicious techniques (like using WebClient to download files), it's more likely suspicious. So, my confidence is around 0.85 that this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating PowerShell downloading files from GitHub and executing scripts, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. So, first things first, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see multiple instances where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. The commands look like they're using WebClient to download files into the TEMP directory. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell scripts are commonly used in malicious activities, especially when dealing with file downloads from external sources.\n\nNext, there's an event where Chrome.exe is involved in multiple Registry value sets. While Chrome itself isn't necessarily malicious, frequent registry modifications can sometimes indicate suspicious activity, like potential adware or tracking software altering system settings without user consent.\n\nThen, I notice several events related to the MpDefenderCoreService.exe process making network connections. This service is part of Windows Defender, so it's expected to make network calls for updates and threat detection. However, if there are an unusual number of such connections or they're directed to unexpected locations, it might warrant further investigation.\n\nThere are also events involving winlogbeat.exe creating files in a downloads directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so seeing it create configuration files isn't inherently suspicious. But the path mentioned seems a bit off, and repeated file creations could be worth looking into to ensure there's no misconfiguration or abuse.\n\nAdditionally, processes like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe setting registry values aren't unusual on their own, but they should be monitored in context with other events. Notepad.exe modifying the registry might seem odd since it's a simple text editor, but sometimes legitimate applications do this, so I'd need more data to judge.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell executions downloading files, which is concerning. The repeated Registry modifications by various processes could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. While some events are benign, the combination suggests possible malicious activity, such as a script being downloaded and executed, possibly installing malware or establishing persistence.\n\nI also notice that several of these events involve the same user account (fiddelis), which might indicate targeted activity against that user's system. The use of different GitHub repositories in the download paths is another point to consider—these could be part of a larger campaign or unrelated, but it's hard to tell without more context.\n\nIn summary, while not every event is malicious on its own, the combination of multiple PowerShell downloads, registry modifications, and network activity from MpDefenderCoreService makes this batch interesting for further investigation. There's a pattern that could indicate malicious behavior, so I'd recommend looking into these events more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub repositories and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, first, I'll go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few logs, there are processes like calc.exe and svchost.exe. Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal because it's a system file. Svc host has some registry activity, which isn't unusual since it's often used by services. There are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values; that doesn't immediately raise a red flag.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe doing the same as calc.exe, so that seems consistent and probably not suspicious on its own. The next event is powershell.exe being accessed, which can be tricky because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. I'll keep an eye out for how it's being used here.\n\nMoving on, whoami.exe running with a command line looks like a standard user information retrieval tool. But the fact that it's being executed multiple times could indicate something if paired with other actions. \n\nI notice several instances where cmd.exe is run with specific commands. For example, one of them deletes a task using SCHTASKS and another deletes registry entries in HKCU's Run key. These activities might be part of an attempt to remove traces of malicious software or disable certain functionalities. The use of command-line tools like cmd.exe and reg.exe for registry modifications is concerning because it suggests someone is trying to make changes at the system level, which could be malicious.\n\nThere are multiple powershell.exe events with ProcessAccess tasks. While PowerShell itself isn't bad, repeated access without clear purpose might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or gather information. The registry operations in these logs also stand out—several entries show RegistryEvent and Registry object changes, which can be signs of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.\n\nAnother thing I see is the deletion of specific registry keys under HKCU\\Run using reg.exe. This key typically stores startup programs, so removing entries here might be an attempt to disable persistence points for malicious software. The repeated deletions and process creations (like schtasks.exe) could be part of a script trying to clean up traces or modify system behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple processes accessing registry keys, deleting tasks, and using command-line tools in a way that suggests someone is trying to hide their tracks or remove malicious components. While individual events might not be suspicious, the combination—especially the repetitive use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe for deletions, and registry modifications—points towards potential malicious activity. The frequency and variety of these actions increase my concern.\n\nI'm a bit uncertain because some of these could be legitimate admin tasks or script executions, but given the volume and specific commands used (like deleting Run keys and SCHTASKS), it's more likely to be something malicious trying to clean up after itself. So overall, I think this batch is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations, registry modifications, and deletions of scheduled tasks and registry entries, which may indicate malicious activity such as persistence removal or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be both legitimate for system administration tasks and commonly used for malicious activities. So, the presence of several PowerShell processes catches my attention.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, some events mention \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\". That makes sense because when a new process starts, like PowerShell, this event would trigger. Not suspicious on its own, but combined with other actions, it might be concerning.\n\nThere are also entries where the task is \"Registry value set\". This could indicate that something is modifying the system's registry. Malware often uses the registry to maintain persistence or configuration. So, seeing multiple registry write events from PowerShell raises a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the file operations. I see both \"File created\" and \"File Delete logged\" events related to temporary files in the user's AppData directory. The filename \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1\" seems unusual. Temporary files created by scripts could be part of normal operations, but if they're being deleted immediately after creation, it might suggest an attempt to avoid detection or execute malicious code that doesn't persist.\n\nAdditionally, there are \"Pipe Created\" events and some tasks labeled as \"Provider Lifecycle\", \"Engine Lifecycle\". These could indicate communication between processes or module loading within PowerShell. Malware often uses such techniques to hide its activities or communicate with command-and-control servers.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the user's Startup folder for PowerShell, which might be a way to ensure persistence across reboots. This is another concerning sign because attackers would want their malicious scripts to run every time the system starts.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple instances of the same command lines and tasks repeating, which could indicate scripting or automated behavior, possibly malicious in nature.\n\nPutting all this together, while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the combination—especially the repeated use of PowerShell for registry modifications, file operations, and potential persistence mechanisms—suggests possible malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications and file operations in temporary directories, suggest potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm noticing a lot of activity related to PowerShell and other command-line tools. The first event is whoami.exe running, which is normal for user identification. But then there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and used. Specifically, there are several ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks logged for PowerShell.\n\nLooking closer, some PowerShell processes are setting registry values. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to hide malicious activities. The repeated calls to PowerShell could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or modify system configurations without proper authorization.\n\nThere's also a file creation and subsequent deletion of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory. Creating and then deleting a script file might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies, especially if it's part of a larger script execution process. This kind of activity could be a sign of malicious scripting or testing the environment's security.\n\nThe fact that multiple events involve PowerShell accessing different system files and registry keys suggests potential unauthorized access attempts.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this JSONL data to determine if it's worth investigating. First, I notice a lot of events from powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag due to its scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple Registry value sets by different processes like Calculator.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and chrome.exe. These activities could indicate malicious behavior as attackers might modify system settings to maintain persistence.\n\nI see several instances where files were created or accessed, especially in the case of powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This path seems suspicious because it's related to PowerShell profile data and could be used for persistence across reboots.\n\nThe command lines show that some powershell.exe processes are executing scripts with commands like Remove-Item, which is used to delete files. The exact command in one of the events removes a .zip file from TEMP without errors, suggesting an attempt to clean up traces, which is common in malware activities.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad tasks in the logs indicate that various DLLs are being loaded by powershell.exe. While this can be normal for script execution, the specific paths and the volume might raise concerns about malicious code injection or loading unauthorized modules.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe to get system information could be part of reconnaissance to gather details before more malicious actions. This is a classic step in attacker behavior patterns.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: repeated registry modifications, file creation and deletion by powershell scripts, potential persistence mechanisms, and signs of data exfiltration or cleanup attempts.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The user wants me to analyze all the events together and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities. There are several instances where PowerShell is being used with command lines that delete files in the TEMP directory. For example, commands like Remove-Item are present multiple times, targeting different .zip and .txt files in $env:TEMP.\n\nLooking deeper, these deletion commands seem repetitive and patterned. The file paths are varied but all point to temporary files, which is common for malware to clean up after themselves. Also, the use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is designed to not show any error messages if something goes wrong, which is another suspicious behavior because attackers don't want to alert users.\n\nThere's also an instance where a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 is created and then deleted. This could be part of a script checking if PowerShell's execution policy allows scripts to run, which is a common technique in attacks to bypass restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, there are events showing the loading of DLLs related to Windows Defender (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll). Malware sometimes loads legitimate system components to avoid detection or to perform certain tasks that appear benign.\n\nOther processes like chrome.exe and conhost.exe are also present but don't show malicious activity. The whoami.exe command is a standard tool for checking user information, so that's not concerning on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with file deletions in TEMP, along with script creation and deletion, suggests potential malicious activity such as a cleanup routine after an attack or lateral movement within a network. These patterns are indicative of possible compromise or suspicious behavior, making this batch relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events show repeated file deletions in the TEMP directory using Remove-Item commands with -ErrorAction Ignore.

This suggests someone might be trying to clean up traces or evidence, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are several file creation and deletion events related to temporary files. The fact that the same user (fiddelis) is involved in multiple file operations makes me think this isn't just normal script execution.\n\nI notice some registry changes from conhost.exe and powershell.exe, which could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, there's an instance where whoami.exe was run, which is often used to gather user information—potentially for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThe variety of tasks logged, including file operations and image loading, seems extensive and not typical of everyday activities.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is a Registry value set. That's unusual because Chrome doesn't typically make many registry changes during normal operation. But maybe it's just part of its standard behavior? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThen, I see an entry for 'RuntimeBroker.exe'. This process is known to handle Windows runtime components, so a Registry access might be normal here as well. Not too concerning yet.\n\nNext up are several events involving 'powershell.exe'. The tasks include 'Process accessed' and also some file creations. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and common for admins too. But seeing multiple accesses could mean someone is using it, either legitimately or maliciously. Also, if there are file creations, especially in user downloads, that might be suspicious.\n\nThere are entries where 'whoami.exe' is executed with command lines pointing to system32. Using whoami can reveal user information, which might be part of reconnaissance. The fact that this happens multiple times could indicate an attempt to gather info on the system's users.\n\nLooking further down, there's a file creation event by 'winlogbeat.exe', which I assume is related to log management. The path seems legitimate, so probably not an issue.\n\nAnother file creation event is from 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in the user's downloads. The name sounds like it could be Portuguese for something active or package-related. It's unclear if this is malicious, but combined with other PowerShell activity and whoami.exe usages, it raises flags.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple Registry accesses by Chrome and RuntimeBroker might not be too bad on their own, but the repeated use of PowerShell and whoami.exe stands out. These could indicate someone exploring the system or trying to gather information. The creation of a file in downloads by PowerShell adds another layer of suspicion.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because while some events are normal, others like the repeated PowerShell access and file creations might signal malicious activity or at least unauthorized use.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple Registry access events by Chrome.exe, potential PowerShell abuse with file creation in Downloads, and repeated whoami.exe executions, indicating possible reconnaissance or malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
