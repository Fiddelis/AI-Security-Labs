{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell process accessed with the ProcessAccess task. That's notable because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. The second event shows whoami.exe being executed, which is usually harmless but could indicate reconnaissance.\n\nThe third and fifth events again show powershell.exe accesses, which raises suspicion as repeated access might be part of an ongoing malicious activity. The fourth event uses cmd.exe with a command to create Notepad.exe via WMIC, which is a known technique for remote execution and can be malicious.\n\nNext, the sixth and seventh events involve WMIC.exe loading different DLLs. While WMIC is legitimate, it's also commonly abused in attacks. Lastly, the eighth event shows PowerShell creating a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt', which translates to 'temporary object'. This naming might be an attempt to hide malicious content or create temporary files for malicious purposes.\n\nCombining all these events: multiple PowerShell accesses, use of WMIC and cmd.exe for process creation, and file creation with a suspicious name suggest potential malicious activity. The repeated use of these tools is red flags in the context of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell, WMIC.exe, and cmd.exe which are often used for malicious activities such as process creation and file manipulation. The repeated use of these tools raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
