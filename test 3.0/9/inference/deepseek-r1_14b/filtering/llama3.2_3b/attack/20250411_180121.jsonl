Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. Each event has three fields: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking through the events:\n\n1. There are multiple instances where 'chrome.exe' is detected with network connections and registry changes. This could be normal user activity, especially if Chrome is handling updates or extensions.\n\n2. The more concerning part seems to involve 'powershell.exe'. I notice that in several events, PowerShell is being executed with command lines that perform web downloads. For example:\n   - One event shows a download from \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_base\/objeto_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" to the TEMP directory.\n   - Similarly, there are multiple such events downloading different files from various GitHub repositories into the TEMP folder.\n\n3. These command lines suggest that PowerShell is being used to execute arbitrary code downloaded from remote locations. This behavior could be a red flag for potential malicious activity because it's a common technique in cyberattacks (like ransomware or malware) to download scripts or executables over the internet and run them locally.\n\n4. Additionally, there are events where files are created and then deleted, such as \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1\". This might be an attempt to bypass certain script execution policies by creating a temporary script file and then deleting it after execution.\n\n5. The repeated use of 'powershell.exe' with similar patterns strengthens the suspicion that this activity is not benign. It's more than just occasional script execution—it looks like a concerted effort to download multiple files, possibly malicious in nature.\n\n6. While 'chrome.exe' events are present and might seem suspicious due to registry changes, it's less concerning compared to the PowerShell activities unless there's a specific reason to believe Chrome is compromised.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows a pattern of potentially malicious behavior involving PowerShell downloading files from GitHub and creating\/deleting temporary files. This combination suggests an attack vector that could be worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to download files from remote repositories, which is indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst up is a PowerShell process that's downloading something from a GitHub repo into the user's temp directory. That catches my attention because downloading files, especially from external sources, can be a red flag for malicious activity. It could indicate someone trying to bring in unauthorized code or tools.\n\nNext, there are several events involving different processes like conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and notepad.exe performing file creations or registry changes. These might seem normal, but the combination with other suspicious activities is something to watch.\n\nI notice multiple instances of PowerShell accessing files, modifying the registry, and creating processes. This pattern is concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for their malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities and prevalence in environments.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process deleting a scheduled task using SCHTASKS. Deleting tasks can be part of an attacker's cleanup routine to remove traces of their activity or prevent detection.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command deletes a registry entry related to a \"modulo_temporario\". Malware often removes itself from the system's startup entries to ensure persistence, so this could indicate efforts to cover tracks.\n\nThere are also reg.exe commands deleting more registry entries, specifically under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is another common tactic for malware to remove its presence from the system's auto-run list.\n\nAdditionally, there are instances of processes accessing each other and creating new ones without clear justification, which might be indicative of process injection or lateral movement within a network.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show a series of actions that suggest an attempt to download and execute malicious code using PowerShell, followed by efforts to clean up traces. This behavior is typical of cyberattacks where attackers try to maintain persistence and avoid detection. The repeated use of command-line tools for deletion and registry modifications adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because it shows potential signs of a breach or attack in progress. While some events on their own might be benign, the combination points towards malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious activities such as downloading files from external sources using PowerShell, deleting scheduled tasks and registry entries to cover tracks, which collectively indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's see what we have here.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of events related to powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers because it can do both good and bad things. So seeing multiple entries from the same process might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at each event, there's \"Image loaded\" tasks for mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so that doesn't immediately seem suspicious on their own. But when combined with other powershell activities, it could indicate something more.\n\nThere are also file creation events in the Temp directory. The files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 and another one with a different name. Creating new script files can be part of normal operations, but if these scripts aren't supposed to be there or are created by an untrusted process, it might be malicious.\n\nRegistry value sets from powershell.exe could mean that the script is trying to modify system configurations. Attackers often use registry modifications for persistence or to change system behaviors. The fact that this happens multiple times with different timestamps makes me think something's being set repeatedly, possibly trying to hide or make changes permanent.\n\nThere are process creations for conhost.exe and cmd.exe. Conhost is sometimes used by powershell as a host, but seeing it alongside other suspicious activities might not be normal. Similarly, cmd.exe can be innocent, but when paired with powershell and these file writes, it's something to look into.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the repeated use of \"powershell.exe & {}\" in command lines. That seems a bit odd—maybe an attempt to run multiple commands or obfuscate them? The exact syntax isn't familiar to me, so that could be a sign of scripting trying to hide its actions.\n\nThe events also include registry writes from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and chrome.exe, which are legitimate processes. But seeing these alongside powershell activities might indicate that powershell is interacting with other programs in ways it shouldn't.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell instances creating files, modifying the registry, loading .NET components, and having unusual command lines. These actions could be part of a script trying to establish persistence, drop malicious payloads, or hide its tracks. The repetition and combination of different tasks make me think there's a pattern that's not typical user activity.\n\nHowever, I also have to consider that some of these activities might be from legitimate scripts or normal operations. For example, powershell is often used for system administration tasks, so some events could be benign. But the volume and specific actions like creating temp files with script names make me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nSo overall, while there's a chance it's not malicious, the combination of activities points towards something potentially interesting that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show file creation in Temp directory and registry modifications, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they're all from powershell.exe. The command lines show that it's trying to remove files from the TEMP directory, like objeo_principal.zip and others. This caught my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Removing files could be part of cleaning up after dropping malware or exfiltrating data.\n\nI notice there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing different system components, like loading images (clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll) and interacting with the registry. These actions alone aren't suspicious, but combined with the file deletions, it makes me think about whether these activities are part of a larger script or process.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is executed. While that's generally used to check user permissions, seeing it alongside powershell.exe might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gather information about the system.\n\nAnother thing I'm noticing is that several files in the TEMP directory are being deleted. The paths seem arbitrary (like tarefa_base.zip, estrutura_geral.zip), but could they be part of a larger payload? Malware often deletes its traces after execution.\n\nThe events where powershell.exe creates and then immediately deletes a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1) are concerning. This might be an attempt to bypass script execution policies by deleting the script right after creation, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe processes with commands to delete specific files, registry access, and file deletions including a script that's created and removed quickly. These activities could indicate malicious behavior such as cleaning up traces of an attack or executing a script meant to cause harm. The fact that several different files are being targeted suggests it's not just a simple mistake but possibly part of a coordinated sequence.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level. While each individual event might not be highly suspicious, the combination does raise red flags. Malware often uses such techniques to stay under the radar and ensure its presence isn't detected. The repeated use of powershell.exe for file deletions and the quick script execution\/deletion are strong indicators that this could be malicious activity.\n\nSo, I think this batch is definitely worth investigating further. There's enough here to suggest potential malicious intent, especially considering the methods used to hide or remove evidence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Instances**: The extensive use of powershell.exe is notable. While legitimate, it's frequently exploited in cyberattacks for its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **File Deletions**: Several events show powershell.exe deleting files from the TEMP directory. These deletions target specific zip and txt files, which could be evidence of malicious payload components being removed to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Registry and Image Access**: The script accesses various system components, including registry entries and system images, which might be part of privilege escalation or data exfiltration activities.\n\n4. **Whoami Execution**: The execution of whoami.exe alongside powershell.exe could indicate an attempt to gather user information or check permissions for further attacks.\n\n5. **Script Creation and Deletion**: A PowerShell script is created and immediately deleted. This tactic may be used to bypass script execution policies, a common strategy in malware to avoid detection.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of file deletions, script manipulation, and system access points strongly suggests malicious intent. These activities are consistent with tactics used in cyberattacks to hide traces and execute harmful scripts. Therefore, this batch is considered interesting for further investigation due to the potential indications of a security breach or attack."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with commands to remove files from the TEMP directory. The command lines are using Remove-Item against specific .txt files. This seems a bit suspicious because deleting files in the TEMP directory could be part of malicious activity trying to cover tracks or clean up evidence. However, sometimes legitimate processes also delete temporary files, so I can't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks associated with these powershell.exe entries, they include Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, and others. These seem related to how Windows handles events and might not necessarily be malicious on their own. But the combination of multiple powershell executions with file deletions is still notable.\n\nThen there's an entry where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is often used in command-line environments and could be part of legitimate operations, but again, it's something to keep an eye on if combined with other actions.\n\nI also notice several chrome.exe processes setting registry values multiple times. This might be normal browser activity, especially if extensions or updates are being installed. But the frequency here is three instances, which could indicate something more if these events are unusual for the user.\n\nThere are a few whoami.exe executions. Whoami is a standard tool to check user information, so this in itself isn't suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern, like privilege escalation attempts.\n\nAnother point is the file paths mentioned. Powershell is creating files in user-specific directories like Downloads. The filenames like 'objeto_padrao.txt' and 'pacote_ativo.txt' don't immediately ring any bells as malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. The creation of these files by powershell could be part of data exfiltration or configuration changes.\n\nAdditionally, there are process access events related to various executables, which can occur during normal operations when processes interact with each other. However, the high number of such events across different binaries might suggest some form of monitoring or activity that's beyond standard use.\n\nThe last event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a config file in its own directory, which is expected behavior if it's managing log shipping or configuration. This doesn't raise any red flags on its own but adds to the overall picture of system activity.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might seem benign, the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific commands, coupled with multiple process creations and file operations across different executables, creates a pattern that could indicate malicious behavior. The high frequency of certain tasks like registry modifications and file deletions in TEMP adds to this suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances deleting files from TEMP directory and creating files in user's Downloads, combined with several process creations and registry changes, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
