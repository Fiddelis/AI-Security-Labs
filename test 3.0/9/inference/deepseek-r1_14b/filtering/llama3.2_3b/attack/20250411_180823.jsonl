{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That's normal since browsers do that frequently, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll isn't unusual because system processes often load various DLLs. No red flags there.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing the registry. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, but on its own, a registry access event doesn't indicate anything suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, schtasks.exe has a command line that creates a new task scheduled to run calc.exe on startup under system privileges. That's concerning because creating tasks with elevated rights can be a way for malware to persist. The fact that it's using a command-line argument (calc.exe) which is typically benign but could be used maliciously if part of a larger attack.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where svchost.exe creates files in the Tasks directory, like \"modulo_principal_005_OnLogon\" and \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\". These look like custom task names. Since svchost is a legitimate process but often used by malware to hide activities, creating these tasks could be an attempt at persistence or scheduling malicious actions.\n\nOther events include conhost.exe and more registry accesses from various processes. While these in isolation aren't suspicious, the combination with other events raises concerns.\n\nTaking all together: There are legitimate user activities (chrome, calc), normal system processes (svchost, schtasks), but also signs of potential persistence mechanisms and unusual task creations that might indicate malicious intent. The repeated use of registry modifications and task scheduling under different names suggests possible attempted persistence or backdoor creation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch contains multiple events that are somewhat concerning when viewed together. There's a significant number of registry accesses and file operations from various processes, including powershell.exe and schtasks.exe, which could be indicative of malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events that may indicate potential malicious activity, including suspicious process creation, registry modifications, and file operations. The combination suggests possible attempts at persistence or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
