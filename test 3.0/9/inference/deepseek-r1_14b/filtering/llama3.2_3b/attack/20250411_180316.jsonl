I'm looking at a batch of system log events from various processes on a Windows machine. The goal is to determine if the entire set is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\n1. **RuntimeBroker.exe** setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is a legitimate Windows process used for managing runtime aspects, so this isn't suspicious.\n2. **powershell.exe** being accessed. Powershell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n3. **calc.exe** loading urlmon.dll. Calc is a standard calculator; however, loading an unusual DLL might be suspicious. URLmon.dll is part of Windows and handles URLs, so maybe not malicious here.\n4. **svchost.exe** setting registry values. Svchost is another common process that runs various services, so this activity is normal.\n5. **Calculator.exe** also loads urlmon.dll. Similar to point 3; worth noting but not necessarily suspicious.\n6. More powershell accesses and a cmd.exe command deleting Notepad.exe via WMIC. Deleting system processes can be malicious if unauthorized. Using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is common for remote management but could also be used by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation.\n7. **WMIC.exe** loading urlmon.dll again—nothing unusual here as it's part of the OS.\n8. Notepad.exe setting a registry value—benign activity since Notepad is a simple text editor.\n9. cmd.exe accessing the registry again, possibly for legitimate admin tasks or malicious activities.\n10. Chrome.exe and conhost.exe also setting registry values; these are standard processes that might interact with the registry.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, I notice multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed (sometimes in combination with other commands) and several attempts to modify system files or delete processes using cmd.exe and WMIC. Specifically, there's a command trying to delete Notepad.exe via wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete, which is concerning because it could indicate an attempt to remove tools that might be used for detection.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated use of powershell.exe without clear legitimate activity (like script execution) adds up. Powershell is often a favorite tool for attackers due to its scripting capabilities and access to system functions. The fact that cmd.exe is being used with commands like 'copy' and 'schtasks \/delete' suggests potential attempts to modify system configurations or delete tasks, which could be signs of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an attempt to overwrite sethc.exe using a copy command in cmd.exe. Sethc.exe is part of the Windows shell; replacing it might be an attempt to create persistence mechanisms or hide certain processes.\n\nFurthermore, the use of schtasks.exe and deleting scheduled tasks with '\/delete \/f' could indicate an attacker trying to remove traces of their activities or disrupt normal system operations.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of multiple powershell accesses, process deletions, registry modifications, and attempts to replace system files points towards potential malicious activity. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the cumulative effect suggests a possible security incident that requires investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Malicious Activity\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The logs indicate multiple instances of potentially malicious activities such as deleting system processes (notepad.exe), accessing powershell for unknown purposes, and attempting to modify or delete scheduled tasks.

Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities like command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's being called with various command lines in different events might be significant.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged: there are several Registry value sets, Process Creates, Image loads, File creations, Pipe Created events, and Provider Lifecycle events. Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts. The ImageLoad events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, which could be normal but sometimesDLL injection techniques might be at play here.\n\nThe command lines in some of the powershell.exe processes are obfuscated or contain conditional checks using Test-Path on specific batch files. This behavior seems unusual and possibly indicative of an attempt to check for certain file presence before executing commands. Such checks can be part of malicious scripts to avoid detection or ensure they run only under specific conditions.\n\nAlso, multiple instances where powershell.exe is called with \"& { ... }\" suggests that it's being used to execute other scripts or commands. The repeated use of exit codes (exit 0 or exit 1) based on file existence might be an attempt to control the script flow, possibly as part of a larger payload deployment.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files in temporary directories (like C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\) and references to batch files in different paths. These could be temporary storage for malicious scripts or tools, which is a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, the events involving cmd.exe with command_line \"\/c\" suggest that it's being used to execute commands. While cmd is commonly used, the combination with other powershell activities might indicate script execution through multiple layers of process spawning, a technique often employed by attackers to obfuscate their tracks.\n\nThe presence of ProcessCreate and RegistryEvent tasks in different events further supports the idea that something is being set up or configured on the system, possibly for persistence or to gain higher privileges.\n\nConsidering all these points together—abnormal powershell command usages, registry modifications, file creations, and multiple process spawns—it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting. The activities don't appear to be standard user behavior and could indicate a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple powershell.exe processes with unusual command lines, including conditional checks on file existence and references to temporary files.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing various files and registry keys. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any PowerShell activity should be scrutinized.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. The first few entries show powershell.exe accessing DLLs and creating temporary files. Creating temp files isn't inherently bad, but it's something to keep an eye on, especially if these files are created in unexpected locations or with unusual names.\n   \n2. There are several instances where files are being deleted right after they're created. For example, a file is created and then immediately deleted. This behavior could indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity or to execute commands without leaving long-term artifacts.\n\n3. I notice that the command lines in some events are obfuscated with backslashes and paths like \"..\\\\modulo_ativo\" which might be trying to confuse analysis by using relative paths or non-existent directories. Obfuscation is a red flag because attackers often use it to hide their tracks.\n\n4. The events involve creating batch files (like *.bat) through PowerShell commands. This is concerning because batch files can execute arbitrary code, and if created maliciously, they could be used to run harmful scripts upon system startup or other triggers.\n\n5. There are several registry writes by powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, allowing attackers to maintain access to the system even after reboots.\n\n6. The repetitive creation and deletion of files, combined with the use of PowerShell to create batch files in various locations (like Downloads and Temp directories), suggests a pattern that could be indicative of script testing or payload deployment.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not raise alarms on their own, the combination—especially the repeated file operations, registry changes, and obfuscation techniques—points towards potential malicious activity. The fact that these actions are spread across multiple processes and involve both file system and registry modifications increases the suspicion. It's possible that an attacker is testing the environment or setting up components for a larger attack.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to definitively say this is malicious. But given the red flags present, especially the obfuscation and repeated attempts to create\/deleted files, it's definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process and Activity:** The logs show multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations and registry modifications. Powershell is a tool often used in cyberattacks due to its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Analyze File Operations:** Several events involve creating temporary files and immediately deleting them, which can be indicative of an attempt to hide traces or execute malicious code temporarily.\n\n3. **Obfuscation Techniques:** The use of complex paths with \"..\" suggests attempts to obfuscate directory structures, a common tactic in malware to evade detection.\n\n4. **Batch File Creation:** The creation of batch files via PowerShell commands is concerning as these files can be used to execute arbitrary scripts, potentially harmful ones.\n\n5. **Registry Modifications:** Writing to the registry can indicate an attempt to establish persistence, allowing attackers to maintain access post-reboot.\n\n6. **Pattern Recognition:** The repetitive nature of file creation\/deletion and multiple batch file creations across different directories suggest a coordinated effort that could be part of malicious activity setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these factors—use of powershell.exe for file operations, registry modifications, obfuscation, and batch file creation—raises suspicions of potential malicious activity. While not conclusive on its own, this behavior warrants further investigation to ensure system integrity and security."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm looking at a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows `powershell.exe` being executed with some command lines that involve creating new items and setting content in various batch files. There are also mentions of tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. This seems a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, especially when creating or modifying scripts.\n\n2. The next few events continue to show similar patterns—`powershell.exe` commands that create new files or set content in different locations on the system. Some of these are under different paths like `C:\\modulo_base`, `C:\\registro_secundario`, etc. This repeated activity might indicate script generation, which could be part of a malicious script deployment.\n\n3. There's an event where `powershell.exe` creates a file in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`). Temporary files created by PowerShell scripts can sometimes be related to persistence mechanisms or script testing, which might not always be malicious but could warrant further investigation.\n\n4. Another event shows `powershell.exe` accessing a DLL file associated with Windows Defender. That's normal since PowerShell often loads various system libraries. However, combined with other activities, it's something to note.\n\n5. I notice multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is used to check if certain script files exist using `Test-Path`. If the file doesn't exist, it exits with 0; otherwise, it continues. This behavior might be part of a larger script checking for existing configurations or attempting to avoid detection by not executing further actions if certain conditions are met.\n\n6. There's an event where a file is deleted (`FileDeleteDetected`). Deleting files can sometimes indicate an attempt to cover tracks, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\n7. The events also mention pipes being created, which could be used for communication between processes or for obfuscating command lines, again something that's not inherently malicious but worth monitoring when combined with other activities.\n\nPutting all this together, the recurring theme is `powershell.exe` executing commands that involve file creation, deletion, and testing for existing files across various directories. The repeated use of PowerShell scripting in different locations might suggest a script being run multiple times or attempting to create persistence points across the system.\n\nI'm concerned because while individual actions could be benign, the volume and variety of these activities raise red flags. It's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell to drop malicious scripts or establish persistence on the system. The use of temporary files and repeated checks for existing script files might indicate an attempt to ensure persistence without being detected.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that this could be part of a legitimate administrative process, such as script deployment or configuration management. To determine if this is truly malicious, I would need more context about the source of these events. For example, knowing if these scripts were authorized or part of known system processes would help rule out malicious intent.\n\nGiven the uncertainty but leaning towards potential risk due to the nature of the activities and the use of PowerShell, I think it's prudent to consider this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** Multiple events show `powershell.exe` executing commands that create files and check for existing script files across various directories.\n\n2. **Assess Each Activity:**\n   - File creation\/deletion in different system paths using PowerShell.\n   - Temporary file creation by PowerShell, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or malicious script testing.\n   - Use of `Test-Path` to check if scripts exist, potentially indicating an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Consider the Nature of Commands:**\n   - While individual commands can be benign, the repeated use across different directories suggests a possible script deployment or persistence setup.\n\n4. **Evaluate Potential Risks:**\n   - The activities align with behaviors seen in malicious scripts aiming for system compromise or persistence.\n   - The use of PowerShell, a tool commonly exploited by attackers, increases suspicion.\n\n5. **Determine Interest Level:**\n   - Given the combination of file manipulations and checks, it's reasonable to consider this batch as interesting for investigation, despite the possibility of being legitimate administrative tasks.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** This batch of events is deemed interesting for further cybersecurity investigation due to the concerning nature of the activities involving `powershell.exe` and file manipulation across multiple system directories."}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first log shows that powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That seems a bit odd because non-interactive profiles usually don't run scripts, but maybe it's just normal behavior. Next, there are several entries where powershell.exe is accessing processes or files. Some of them have command lines with if statements checking for specific .exe files and exiting based on their presence. This looks like scripting to check for certain binaries, which could be part of a script running checks.\n\nThere are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed, which might be used to get system information or user details. That's a common command but can also be part of malicious activities if used in the wrong context.\n\nI notice that several powershell.exe processes have exited with exit codes 0 or 1 based on whether certain files exist. This pattern suggests some form of script execution, possibly checking for specific binaries on the system. The repetition of similar command lines might indicate a loop or multiple checks, which could be part of a larger script.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary files by powershell.exe. For example, deleting __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1 could mean they're trying to bypass certain policy restrictions, like running unsigned scripts.\n\nLooking at image loads and process accesses, there's nothing immediately suspicious except for theDlls loaded by powershell.exe, which are standard .NET framework components. The interaction with Windows Defender's MpClient.dll might be normal or could indicate an attempt to disable antivirus temporarily.\n\nThe variety of command lines in the powershell.exe processes suggests multiple scripts running at different times, possibly related to a larger campaign or malicious activity. The repeated checks for specific files across different directories (like registro_principal, entrada_auxiliar, etc.) might indicate an attempt to spread across the system looking for certain targets.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of script execution, file checking, and potential attempts to bypass restrictions, which could be indicative of malicious behavior. However, without more context on what these scripts are doing or the source of the commands, it's hard to be certain. But the combination does raise some red flags that warrant closer investigation.\n\nSo overall, while not conclusive, there are enough signs that make me think this batch is worth looking into further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Final Answer:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Activities:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing scripts with conditional checks for specific files.\n   - Use of `whoami.exe` to potentially gather system information.\n   - Creation and deletion of temporary files, possibly to bypass script policy restrictions.\n\n2. **Analyze Patterns:**\n   - Repetitive command lines in powershell.exe suggest automated or script-based activities.\n   - File existence checks across various directories may indicate a broader search for targets.\n\n3. **Assess Potential Intent:**\n   - The activities could be part of reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or installing malware components.\n   - Bypassing script policies might aim to execute malicious scripts without user consent.\n\n4. **Evaluate Suspicious Indicators:**\n   - Temporary file deletions and multiple process creations\/accesses point towards potential evasion techniques.\n   - The use of `cmd.exe` with conditional logic adds another layer, possibly for executing additional commands based on previous checks.\n\n5. **Determine Investigative Value:**\n   - While individual actions may not be conclusive, the combination suggests a coordinated effort that could be malicious.\n   - Further investigation would involve analyzing script contents, correlating timestamps, and checking for network activities or known indicators of compromise.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch contains multiple system calls indicative of potential malicious activity, including script execution checks, file deletions, and process creations. While not definitive on their own, the patterns suggest a coordinated effort that merits further investigation to assess for possible security threats. \n\n**Classification:** The logs are considered **interesting for investigation**, as they exhibit signs potentially indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe batch is classified as **interesting for investigation** due to patterns suggesting potential malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. There are 18 events here. The keys in each JSON object are 'process', 'winlog', and sometimes 'file'.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's the process 'whoami.exe' being created. That seems normal because whoami is a standard system tool used to get user information. No red flags there.\n\nThe next few events involve powershell.exe. The second event shows powershell being accessed, which isn't unusual on its own since PowerShell is a common tool for admins and scripts. But then in the third event, there's a command line that includes some complex path checks with if statements. It looks like it's testing whether certain files exist in specific directories. This kind of file checking can be part of legitimate script behavior, but it could also be malicious if those paths are leading to known bad locations or if the script is doing something after that check.\n\nI notice multiple events where powershell.exe is being accessed, loaded images (like mscoree.dll and clr.dll), which are normal for PowerShell execution. Then there are several events labeled as 'Provider Lifecycle' with command lines similar to the third event. These seem repetitive, each checking different paths across various directories.\n\nLooking further, I see a FileCreate event for a .ps1 file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. Then it's immediately deleted. This seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or to hide malicious code. Additionally, there's another FileCreate event for a profile data file, which might not be too concerning on its own.\n\nPutting this together: multiple PowerShell instances are being created with similar command lines that check various file paths, some of which don't seem immediately suspicious but could be part of a larger script. The creation and deletion of the .ps1 file in Temp is notable because it could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving a trace. Also, the repetitive 'Provider Lifecycle' events might suggest automated or script-driven activity.\n\nThe fact that these events are happening multiple times across different directories makes me think there's a pattern here. While individual actions like checking files or creating temporary scripts can be normal, the combination and repetition raise concerns about potential malicious intent, such as a script trying to execute without being detected or modifying system behavior in a way that could harm security.\n\nSo overall, while each event on its own might not be alarming, together they present a concerning pattern that suggests possible unauthorized or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits characteristics that warrant closer examination for potential malicious activity. Key points to consider:\n\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Activity**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe are created with command lines checking various file paths. This could be legitimate script behavior, but the repetition and variety of paths suggest possible nefarious intent.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Operations**: A .ps1 script is created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted. This action may indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence.\n\n3. **Pattern of Events**: The combination of file checks, script creation\/deletion, and repetitive 'Provider Lifecycle' events suggests automated or script-driven activity that could be attempting to bypass security measures or alter system behavior maliciously.\n\n**Conclusion**: While individual actions might seem benign, the cumulative pattern points towards potential unauthorized activity, making these logs significant for investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with details about the process, Windows log information, and sometimes file data.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed. The command lines all seem to be checking if certain paths exist for a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds familiar—it's often associated with keylogging or capturing keystrokes, which can be malicious. So, seeing this script being checked multiple times might indicate that someone is trying to run it.\n\nAlso, there are events where whoami.exe is executed. Whoami is a legitimate tool, but in some cases, attackers use it to check the current user's permissions or information. The repeated execution could be part of an attempt to gather system info.\n\nLooking at the file events, I see that powershell.exe is accessing various DLLs and creating temporary files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Temporary PowerShell scripts can be a red flag because they might be used for persistence or malicious activities.\n\nThe tasks in the Windows logs include Process Create, Provider Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, and others. These are common events, but combined with the script checks and process creations, it raises suspicion. There's also an event where calc.exe is run, but that alone isn't concerning unless there's more context.\n\nConsidering all these together, it seems like a sequence of actions that could be part of a malicious payload deployment or testing access on the system. The repeated attempts to execute a potentially harmful script and the creation of temporary files might indicate an attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances are checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths, which may indicate malicious activity such as keylogging.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user has given me a set of JSONL events and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'm supposed to look at all the events together.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first two events are from svchost.exe and chrome.exe with network connection detections. That's normal because those processes often connect to networks. But then starting from the third event, it's powershell.exe doing a bunch of things like accessing process, setting registry values, loading images, creating pipes, etc.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being called with specific command lines that involve ls and get-childitem commands recursively. That seems suspicious because those commands can be used for directory traversal or information gathering, which is often part of reconnaissance in an attack.\n\nAlso, the file paths mentioned like 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\assembly...' and later creating a .txt file in Downloads are worth noting. Creating files could indicate that the attacker is trying to leave data or possibly setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. That's more benign unless it's part of some malicious activity, but on its own, I'm not sure about that one.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell.exe activities with potential malicious commands, registry modifications, and file creation. These are red flags because they can be signs of lateral movement or establishing persistence in a network. The repeated use of powershell is concerning as it's often used for attacks due to its scripting capabilities.\n\nI'm pretty confident that this batch should be classified as interesting.
