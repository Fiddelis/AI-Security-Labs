{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a process creation of cmd.exe with some command line arguments that create a scheduled task called win32times using schtasks. The command runs as system user and triggers another cmd which executes powershell with some parameters. But the script file path is NonExistingScript.ps1, which makes me think maybe it was a typo or the script doesn't exist.\n\nThe second event shows schtasks.exe being used to create another scheduled task, this time with a different script path that also doesn't exist (entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1). Again, using powershell with -ep bypass suggests they're trying to bypass execution policies, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nNext, there's an image load event for taskschd.dll when schtasks.exe runs. That's normal since it's part of the scheduled tasks functionality, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen, svchost.exe is creating registry values and files. Svchost is typically associated with legitimate services but can be used by malware if it's a custom version. The file created under C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks seems to be related to the scheduled task win32times.\n\nAnother schtasks.exe event querying the existing task, which is normal for managing tasks.\n\nThere are more image load events for taskschd.dll with schtasks.exe, again nothing unusual there.\n\nConhost.exe accessing registry values. Conhost is usually a legitimate process for console windows, so unless it's doing something malicious here, it might not be an issue. But the fact that it's modifying the registry could be worth noting if other events corroborate it.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory, which seems normal as it's likely writing logs or configuration files. The .winlogbeat.yml.new file is probably part of its setup.\n\nPowershell.exe creating files like estrutura_geral.txt and entrada_ativo.txt. These could be related to the script execution. Since earlier powershell commands were trying to execute scripts that don't exist, these might be attempts to create or write files as part of malicious activities.\n\nChrome.exe accessing registry values twice. Chrome often writes to the registry for various settings, so this is likely benign unless there's something specific about the keys being accessed.\n\nAnother winlogbeat and powershell file creation events, reinforcing that those processes are active and writing files.\n\nWhoami.exe running in a command prompt. This is usually just used to check user permissions but could be part of reconnaissance or testing access levels by malicious actors.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern here of creating scheduled tasks using schtasks with powershell commands. The use of -ep bypass suggests an attempt to execute scripts without restrictions, which is a red flag for potential malware. Also, the script paths don't exist, which might indicate they're trying to avoid detection or maybe those scripts weren't fully deployed yet.\n\nThe combination of process creations, registry modifications, file writes, and scheduled tasks setting up persistent execution points makes this batch interesting. It could be an attempt at persistence and lateral movement in a network, especially if these activities are happening across multiple processes and users.\n\nSo overall, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because there's a clear indication of potentially malicious activity involving process creation, script execution with bypass flags, and scheduled tasks that could be part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events indicating potential malicious activities, including the use of schtasks to create scheduled tasks with powershell.exe commands that attempt to bypass execution policies. The combination of process creations, registry modifications, and file writes suggests possible persistence or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
