{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' performing registry modifications and pipe creations, along with unusual activity from 'updater.exe' creating processes with specific annotations. These actions combined suggest potential misuse or exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Repeated Actions by `chrome.exe`:**\n   - The process `chrome.exe` is repeatedly setting registry values and creating pipes, which could be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence or communication channels typically used in malicious activities.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Creation by `updater.exe`:**\n   - The creation of the `updater.exe` process with a complex command line and specific annotations (`prod=Update4`, `ver=138.0.7156.0`) is atypical for standard updater behavior. This could indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activity as legitimate software updates.\n\n3. **File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`:**\n   - While `winlogbeat.exe` creating files might be normal, it's worth noting in the context of other suspicious activities. It could potentially be used to log or manipulate data if compromised.\n\n4. **System Process Activity:**\n   - The activity from `svchost.exe`, while typically benign as a system process, is part of the broader pattern of unusual behavior when combined with the above points.\n\nOverall, the combination of these events suggests potential misuse or exploitation that warrants further investigation."}
