The presence of command line operations with 'cmd.exe' and 'net.exe' to add users and groups to the Domain Admins group suggests unauthorized privilege escalation attempts. Additionally, the use of non-standard executables like 'net1.exe', which mimics legitimate system processes, could be a sign of evasion techniques. These activities combined warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
