Specifically, the use of `powershell.exe` in multiple events with registry access and process access rules suggests potential unauthorized manipulation or reconnaissance activities. Additionally, the combination of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` querying system information and the Windows Registry highlights potential data exfiltration attempts. The presence of such activities warrants further investigation to determine if they are benign or malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
