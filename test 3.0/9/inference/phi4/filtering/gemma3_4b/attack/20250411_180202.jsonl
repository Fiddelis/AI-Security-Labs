These events include process access, creation, registry value settings, image loading, and file creations by these processes. The frequent use of tools like 'whoami.exe' for command-line execution further suggests potential enumeration or reconnaissance attempts. Such patterns warrant investigation due to the possibility of an attacker exploiting legitimate administrative tools.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
