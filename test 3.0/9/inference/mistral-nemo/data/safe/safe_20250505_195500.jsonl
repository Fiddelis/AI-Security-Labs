These are shared libraries used by various applications and operating system components.\n   - For instance, `powrprof.dll`, `mswsock.dll`, `winhttp.dll` were loaded by `svchost.exe`.\n   - Some DLLs like `wmiutl.dll`, `wmiaprd.hive` were loaded by `wmiapsrv.exe`.\n\nWithout more context or the full JSON data, it's challenging to determine if these events are indicative of a security threat or just regular system operation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's what we can infer:\n\n1. **Process Involved**: The process `SDXHelper.exe` is involved in all these file creation events. This is likely a component of Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **Files Created**: The files being created are variants of `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`. These files seem to be related to the AI copilot feature in Microsoft Office, possibly for different languages or variations.\n\n3. **Frequency and Duration**: The events are happening rapidly, with multiple instances of file creation occurring almost simultaneously. This suggests an automated process rather than manual intervention.\n\n4. **Potential Issue**: There might not necessarily be a problem here unless there's more context. However, if these files are being created repeatedly without any change in their content or purpose, it could indicate a potential issue with the Office application, such as a stuck loop or unnecessary resource consumption.\n\n5. **Further Investigation**: To understand why this is happening, you might want to:\n   - Check if there are any ongoing updates or installations for Microsoft Office.\n   - Look into event logs for related errors or warnings that might provide more context.\n   - Monitor the system's resources (CPU, RAM) to see if these events are causing any noticeable strain.\n\nHere are a few sample entries from your log:\n\n```\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_4418aebcd426cb6df634f82d1d7e5812.js\"}}*\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_4373659712197c87940ed09943dda3ad.js\"}}*\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_4304ae23123a85eeca93a99e1e7d2f98.js\"}}*\n```"}

No unusual registry modifications, no creation or modification of files in system-critical directories, and no network-related activities.\n- **Legitimate Process Involvement**: 'SDXHelper.exe' is a known legitimate Microsoft process used for Office applications, particularly for online collaboration features like Office Online. The files created are also part of standard Office Online functionality, with '.min.js' being minified JavaScript files used for web-based Office apps, and '-ui-strings-json_' files containing user interface strings.\n- **No Persistence Mechanisms**: No attempts to create or modify files in directories that would allow persistence after a reboot (like 'C:\\ProgramData\\', etc.) are observed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided data, the events do not exhibit any malicious characteristics. They can be attributed to legitimate Office Online functionality. Therefore, it is safe to classify these events as Benign."}
