Here are a few things you could investigate:\n\n1. Check if there's any ongoing update or installation process that might be causing this behavior.\n2. Ensure that the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process is not malicious and is part of your system's legitimate operation. You can use security tools like VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, etc., to scan this file.\n3. Look into the files' content to understand why they're being recreated repeatedly. It might be due to dynamic or localized content based on user sessions, location, etc.\n4. If these files are part of an Office-related process (like for Microsoft Teams or Office 365), ensure that the Office software is up-to-date and configured correctly.\n\nTo better understand this issue, it would be helpful to gather more context about your system's configuration, recent activities, and any related errors or warnings."}

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, it seems like your system is repeatedly creating and recreating various versions of a JavaScript file named \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\". Here's what I've observed:\n\n1. The filename remains consistent (officeaicopilot-strings.min.js) but the hash values in the file paths change.\n2. The process responsible for this action is \"SDXHelper.exe\", which likely belongs to a Microsoft Office-related component or add-in.\n3. The task associated with these events is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", suggesting that new versions of the file are being continually generated.\n\nPotential causes and solutions:\n\nA. **Cache\/Cookie issue**: Sometimes, software like browsers or extensions can cause frequent recreation of certain files due to caching or cookie policies. Clearing your browser cache and cookies might help resolve this issue.\n   - *Solution*: Clear your browser cache and cookies, then restart your machine.\n\nB. **Antivirus\/Software conflict**: In some cases, antivirus software or other installed applications can interfere with Microsoft Office components, causing these kinds of file creation loops.\n   - *Solution*: Temporarily disable your antivirus software to see if the issue persists. If it doesn't, try adding SDXHelper.exe as an exception in your antivirus settings.\n\nC. **Microsoft Office-related add-in or component**: The SDXHelper.exe process suggests that this might be due to some Microsoft Office-related add-in or component.\n   - *Solution*: Try disabling any recently installed Microsoft Office add-ins or components to see if the issue persists. You can do this by opening the Microsoft Office application, then going to File > Options > Add-ins (or similar path), selecting the relevant add-in, and clicking \"Go...\" then \"Remove\".\n\nD. **Corrupted installation**: A corrupted installation of Microsoft Office or related software could potentially cause these kinds of issues.\n   - *Solution*: Uninstall and reinstall Microsoft Office completely.\n\nIf none of the above solutions work, I recommend reaching out to official Microsoft Support or their community forums for further assistance tailored to your specific situation."}
