This suggests that they might be related to Microsoft Office's AI copilot feature, and the `.min.` suffix implies they could be minified JavaScript files.\n\nHere are a few observations:\n\n1. Some of these files have duplicates (e.g., `bc142ca4edd5b446409f32f8a4dc857f.js` appears twice), which might indicate an issue with the file creation process.\n2. The process creating these files is likely the `SDXHelper.exe` process, as mentioned in all the JSON-like structures under \"process\".\n3. These files seem to be created rapidly and consecutively, suggesting that they're part of a continuous or ongoing process.\n\nIf you're concerned about the duplicate files or the large number of files being created, I'd recommend reaching out to Microsoft support or consulting their official documentation to better understand this behavior and determine if it's expected or if there might be an issue that needs addressing."}
