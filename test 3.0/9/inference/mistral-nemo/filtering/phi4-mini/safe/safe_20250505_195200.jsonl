This is likely related to Microsoft Office, as it's found in the typical installation directory for Office (`C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root` or similar).\n\n2. **Task:** The task being performed by this process is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that the `SDXHelper.exe` process is creating files.\n\n3. **Files Created:**\n   - A series of JavaScript files with names starting with `excel-copilot-strings_` and containing a long string of characters. These are likely strings or localized resources for Excel's Copilot feature.\n   - Two JavaScript files named `vendors~event-link-plugin.js` and `vendors~file-link-plugin.js`. These could be vendor-specific plugins for event linking and file linking features.\n\n4. **Timing:** The logs show that these files are being created in pairs, with the first instance having a different timestamp than the second.

This activity is likely normal behavior for Microsoft Office. However, if you're concerned about this activity, you may want to monitor it further or reach out to Microsoft support for more information.\n\nAs always, keeping your software up-to-date helps ensure you have the latest security patches and features.
