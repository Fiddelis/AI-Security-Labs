Specifically, the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to create and start a service ('elemento_principal') using 'sc.exe', registry modifications, image loads involving .NET framework components, and the creation of a service. These actions, coupled with several 'ProcessAccess' and 'RegistryEvent' tasks, suggest possible persistence mechanisms and unauthorized modifications.  The use of cmd.exe to create a service with a custom path warrants further investigation as it's unusual. While some events appear benign (e.g., Calculator.exe), the combination warrants scrutiny.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
