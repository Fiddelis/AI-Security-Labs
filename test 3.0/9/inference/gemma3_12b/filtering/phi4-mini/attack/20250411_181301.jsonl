Specifically, the creation of a file 'registro_auxiliar.txt' by powershell.exe and the frequent registry modifications by chrome.exe warrant further investigation to rule out malicious activity. The usage of tasklist.exe, along with image loads of DLLs associated with Windows Defender (MpOAV.dll), also suggest a potential attempt to analyze or evade security measures. The repeated registry modifications, especially coupled with process creation events, are indicators that should be examined closely.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
