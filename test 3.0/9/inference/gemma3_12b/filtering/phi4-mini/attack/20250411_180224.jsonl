The repeated PowerShell script executions and references to non-existent files ('objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1', 'entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1') strongly suggest malicious activity or at least reconnaissance efforts. The frequent registry modifications and file creations by 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe' alongside the initial scheduled task creation warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
