The frequent file creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts strongly suggest potential malicious activity or automated scripting. The multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events, along with the usage of bypass execution policies are indicative of automated activity. The high volume of events warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
