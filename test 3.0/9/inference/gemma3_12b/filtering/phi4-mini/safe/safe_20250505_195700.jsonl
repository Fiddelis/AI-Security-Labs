While this is likely normal behavior for updating game content (DLC, advertisements, and other resource packs), the sheer volume of files being created and downloaded warrants closer examination.  The repeated download of resource packs ('worldgameklondike_pack', 'worldgamepyramid_pack', etc.) might indicate unusual update frequency or potential for malicious activity attempting to leverage the game's update mechanism.
