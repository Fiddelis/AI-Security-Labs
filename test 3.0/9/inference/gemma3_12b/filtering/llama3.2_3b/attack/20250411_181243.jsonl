The multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events associated with the commands suggests a script execution or attempt, potentially part of reconnaissance or initial access activity. The use of mscoree.dll and related .NET components further supports this. While the file creation\/deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1` might be an evasion technique or part of a legitimate script execution, the combination of these events warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
