The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `powershell.exe` commands further obfuscates the activity. The creation of scheduled tasks named 'win32times' and subsequent querying of them is also indicative of reconnaissance or setup for a larger attack. Multiple Chrome registry modifications suggest broader system interaction. The repeated 'FileCreate' tasks for `winlogbeat` and `powershell` with similar user download paths are suspect.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
