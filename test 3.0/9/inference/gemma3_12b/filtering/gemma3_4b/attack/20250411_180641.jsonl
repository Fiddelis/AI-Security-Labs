Specifically, multiple instances of `csc.exe` (C# compiler) are used to compile and execute what appears to be custom executables, often placed in temporary directories.  The command lines suggest a staged compilation and execution process, potentially building and running malicious code. The use of obfuscated filenames (e.g., `pacote_padrao.exe`, `registro_temporario.exe`) further points to an attempt to evade detection. The process creation and subsequent image loading chains involving multiple custom executables warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
