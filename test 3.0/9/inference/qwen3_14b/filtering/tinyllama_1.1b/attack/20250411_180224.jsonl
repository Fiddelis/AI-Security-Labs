The first event stands out because it's a cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task with the command line that includes powershell.exe -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\", which seems suspicious because it's non-existent. Creating a scheduled task that runs a non-existing script might be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process accessed, which could be part of the same activity. The next events involve cmd.exe and schtasks.exe with registry value changes and image loaded events. However, the most notable part is the initial scheduled task creation with the non-existent script. The other events, like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe activities, don't seem directly related to the suspicious activity. The confidence is high because the scheduled task creation with a non-existent script is a red flag for potential malware.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task with a non-existent PowerShell script path ('c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'), which may indicate an attempt to execute malicious code later. The use of 'schtasks' with '\\\/ru system' and '\\\/sc daily' suggests persistence mechanism creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
