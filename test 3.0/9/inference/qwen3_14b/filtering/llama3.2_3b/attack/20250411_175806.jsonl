{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event is whoami.exe being created, which is a normal Windows process. Then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe entry has a command line that adds a registry key under Run with a path to estrutura_principal.exe. That seems suspicious because adding a registry entry in the Run key is often used for persistence. Then there's another reg.exe command adding another entry for pacote_temporario.exe. Both of these could be part of an attack trying to maintain access.\n\nThe conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe entries are more normal. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation. However, the repeated entries for the same file might be worth checking. But the main red flags here are the registry modifications by cmd and reg.exe, which are commonly used in malware for persistence. The combination of these events suggests an attempt to modify the registry for persistence, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. So I think this batch is interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious registry modification attempts via cmd.exe and reg.exe, adding entries to HKCU\\\\Run for persistence. This is a common technique in malware to ensure reexecution after reboots.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
