Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: cmd.exe is creating a scheduled task named 'win32times' with the command line that includes running a PowerShell script. The script path is 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Wait, the filename has 'NonExistingScript' which might indicate the script doesn't exist. But creating a scheduled task with system permissions and using PowerShell with bypassed execution policy is suspicious. That's a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a process access event for powershell.exe, but that's common and not necessarily malicious. Then another schtasks.exe creating a scheduled task again, this time with 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'â€”another non-existing script. The same task name 'win32times' is mentioned again. This repetition might be an attempt to create a persistent backdoor. \n\nThe image load events for schtasks.exe and taskschd.dll are normal, as that's part of the scheduled tasks service. However, the svchost.exe events with registry value sets could be related to modifications in the registry, which is often used by malware to persist. But svchost.exe is a legitimate process, so need to check context.\n\nThen, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.exe's configuration file. That's part of a log shipper, so maybe a false positive. However, the multiple registry events for chrome.exe are unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify its own registry that much, so that might be a sign of something else. \n\nWait, but the main issue is the scheduled tasks being created with non-existent scripts. That's a common technique to hide malicious activities. Also, the use of 'schtasks \/create \/ru system' gives the task high privileges. Even if the script doesn't exist, the task creation itself is suspicious. \n\nAdditionally, the PowerShell commands use '-ep bypass' which is used to bypass execution policies, another red flag. The fact that multiple events involve creating scheduled tasks with these parameters suggests an attempt to establish persistence. \n\nThe other events like svchost.exe and chrome.exe registry changes might be unrelated, but the overall pattern of creating scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts and using PowerShell with bypassed execution policy points to a potential security threat. \n\nSo, combining all these, the batch is interesting because it shows multiple attempts to create scheduled tasks with suspicious parameters, which is a common indicator of malicious activity. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, because the combination of events points to a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show creation of scheduled tasks with non-existent PowerShell scripts using bypassed execution policy (-ep bypass), indicating potential persistence mechanism attempts. The same task name 'win32times' is referenced repeatedly, and system-level permissions (\/ru system) are requested, which are suspicious patterns commonly associated with malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
