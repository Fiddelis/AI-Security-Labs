{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a cmd.exe process that's adding a new user called \"modulo_geral_Admin\" with a password, and then adding that user to the administrators group. That's a red flag. Creating new users and adding them to admin groups is a common attack technique. The command line uses \"net user \/add\" and \"net localgroup administrators\", which are commands typically used for user management. If this is done by an unauthorized user, it's a security issue.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process, but the task is \"Process accessed\" and no command line details. Not sure yet, but PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, so that's something to note.\n\nThen, another cmd.exe with a registry value set. Not sure yet, but registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, there's a net.exe and net1.exe process. The command lines are similar, adding users and adding to admin groups. The use of \"net1.exe\" is odd because the legitimate \"net.exe\" is in the system32 directory. The fact that \"net1.exe\" is being used, which isn't a standard Windows executable, might be a sign of a malicious binary. Also, the paths for net1.exe are pointing to C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1, which is suspicious because system32 is a protected directory and shouldn't have arbitrary executables.\n\nThere are multiple instances of registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify security policies. Also, the presence of HxTsr.exe and its registry changes might be part of malware activity. HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process, so that's another suspicious point.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be normal if it's part of monitoring, but the other file created by powershell.exe is a text file in the Downloads directory. Not sure if that's malicious yet.\n\nThe chrome.exe processes have multiple registry value set events and image loaded events. One of the image loads is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If there's an attempt to modify or bypass AMSI, that could be a sign of evasion techniques. However, just loading amsi.dll isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry changes, process creations, and the use of non-standard executables like net1.exe and HxTsr.exe, along with user account modifications, points toward a potential attack. The attacker might be trying to escalate privileges by adding themselves to the admin group, and using malicious binaries to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: the key suspicious activities are the unauthorized user creation and admin group addition, the use of non-standard executables (net1.exe), and the multiple registry changes. These are all indicators of a possible security breach. Therefore, this batch of logs is definitely interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several **suspicious activities** that indicate potential **malicious activity** and **require further investigation**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Unauthorized User Creation and Privilege Escalation**  \n   - A `cmd.exe` process executed the command:  \n     ```bash\n     net user modulo_geral_Admin [password] \/add && net localgroup administrators modulo_geral_Admin \/add\n     ```  \n     - **Risk**: Creating a new user and adding them to the **Administrators group** is a classic technique for **privilege escalation** or **persistent access**. This could indicate an attacker attempting to gain administrative control.\n\n2. **Suspicious Executable Usage**  \n   - **`net1.exe`** (instead of legitimate `net.exe`) was used in multiple commands:  \n     ```bash\n     net1.exe user modulo_geral_Admin [password] \/add && net1.exe localgroup administrators modulo_geral_Admin \/add\n     ```  \n     - **Risk**: The use of **`net1.exe`** (not a standard Windows utility) in the `system32` directory is highly unusual and may indicate a **malicious binary** being used to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Unusual Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple `Registry Value Set` events (e.g., by `cmd.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `HxTsr.exe`) could indicate **tampering with system settings**, **disabling security features**, or **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup entries).\n\n4. **Non-Standard Processes**  \n   - **`HxTsr.exe`** (not a legitimate Windows process) was involved in registry modifications.  \n   - **`chrome.exe`** was observed modifying registry keys repeatedly, which could signal **malware evasion** or **tampering with security tools** (e.g., AMSI bypass).\n\n5. **File Creation by PowerShell**  \n   - A file named **`componente_secundario.txt`** was created by `powershell.exe`. While not inherently malicious, the file's name and context (if linked to other suspicious events) could indicate **data exfiltration** or **malware configuration**.\n\n6. **AMSIs.dll Loading**  \n   - A `chrome.exe` process loaded **`amsi.dll`**, which is part of Windows Defender's **Antimalware Scan Interface**. This could indicate an attempt to **bypass AMSI** (e.g., by hooking or disabling it), a common tactic in malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **This batch of logs is highly suspicious** and **requires immediate investigation**.  \n- **Key actions to take**:  \n  - **Check for unauthorized user accounts** (e.g., `modulo_geral_Admin`) and their activity.  \n  - **Analyze the `net1.exe` binary** for malicious behavior (e.g., file hash lookup, sandboxing).  \n  - **Investigate the `HxTsr.exe` process** and its registry modifications.  \n  - **Review the `componente_secundario.txt` file** for sensitive data or malware indicators.  \n  - **Check for AMSI bypass techniques** in the `chrome.exe` process.  \n\n- **Potential Threat**: **Privilege escalation, persistence, or malware deployment**.  \n- **Recommendation**: **Isolate affected systems**, perform a **full forensic analysis**, and **enhance monitoring** for lateral movement or data exfiltration.  \n\n--- \n\n**Verdict**: **This batch is a high-priority alert for investigation.**"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided three log entries, all involving chrome.exe and a registry value set event. So first, I need to understand what these events mean.\n\nRegistry value set events usually happen when a program changes a registry key. Chrome.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's modifying the registry, that could be normal or suspicious. However, the logs don't provide much detail beyond the process name and the task. There's no information about which registry key was changed, the user context, or any other parameters that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nSince all three events are the same, it might just be a repeated action by Chrome. For example, Chrome might update its own settings in the registry, which is normal. But if this is happening excessively or in a way that's not typical for Chrome, it could be a sign of something else. However, with the given data, there's no indication of that. \n\nThe lack of additional details like the registry path, the value changed, or the user account under which this is happening makes it hard to determine if this is malicious. The same process doing the same action multiple times could be benign. \n\nSo, considering the information available, these events don't show any clear signs of malicious behavior. The classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's not enough evidence to suggest a security threat. The confidence is around 0.6 because while there's no obvious malicious activity, the lack of details means we can't be entirely certain. But since the user is asking for a classification based on the batch as a whole, and there's no anomaly detected, it's safer to say not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate chrome.exe process modifying registry values, which is normal behavior for Chrome. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
