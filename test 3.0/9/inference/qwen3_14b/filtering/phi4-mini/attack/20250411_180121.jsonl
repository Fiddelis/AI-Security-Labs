So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see several entries involving powershell.exe. \n\nLooking closer, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with a command line that uses WebClient.DownloadFile to download a LICENSE.txt from a GitHub raw link. The paths are temporary files in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That seems a bit odd because downloading files from GitHub might be normal, but the repetition of similar commands across different URLs raises an eyebrow. \n\nWait, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from different GitHub repositories, each time saving to a temporary file. The command lines are similar, using the same structure. That could be a sign of automated scripts or possibly malicious activity, like downloading payloads. \n\nAlso, there are image load events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably just the normal operation of PowerShell. However, the fact that PowerShell is loading those might be normal, but combined with the downloads, it's worth checking.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be part of a cleanup process, but sometimes malicious software does that to avoid leaving traces. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe other events involve registry value sets and process accesses, but again, those could be part of normal operations or configuration changes. The key points here are the repeated PowerShell downloads from GitHub and the temporary file creation\/deletion. \n\nBut wait, GitHub is a common source for legitimate code, so just downloading from there isn't necessarily bad. However, the pattern of multiple downloads, especially if they're from different repositories but similar paths, might indicate something. Also, the use of PowerShell for downloading files could be part of a larger attack chain, like initial access or data exfiltration. \n\nHowever, without seeing the actual content of the downloaded files or more context on the system's normal behavior, it's a bit tricky. The presence of multiple PowerShell events with similar command lines might be a sign of something automated or scripted, which could be benign or malicious. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch does show some unusual activity with PowerShell downloading multiple files from GitHub, which might warrant further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe with registry value set events. That alone might not be suspicious because Chrome can modify the registry for various reasons, like updates or user settings. But the repetition might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's an entry with powershell.exe loading a file from the Windows Defender path. Wait, the file path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. Hmm, that's a legitimate Defender file. But maybe the fact that it's being loaded by PowerShell could be normal, like during a scan or update. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. The URL is https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt. Downloading a LICENSE.txt file might seem harmless, but the domain and repository name are a bit suspicious. Unidade_logico and modulo_comum don't ring a bell as known malicious entities, but sometimes attackers use similar names. Also, the fact that it's using a raw GitHub link could be a way to bypass some detection. However, just downloading a text file might not be malicious on its own.\n\nThen there are several FileCreated events for PowerShell and other processes. The paths are in user directories, which is normal for temporary files. However, the repeated creation of files might indicate some automated process or script running. The presence of a file named \"tarefa_ativo.txt\" could be part of a script's operation, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother entry is about MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so that's expected. No issues there.\n\nThere are multiple instances of winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. However, the repeated creation might be part of a setup or configuration change. Not necessarily malicious, but worth noting.\n\nLooking at the process accesses and registry modifications by PowerShell and other processes, it's possible that someone is trying to modify system settings or inject code. But again, without seeing the actual changes made to the registry, it's hard to determine if it's malicious.\n\nThe whoami.exe command is a standard tool for checking user context, so that's normal. The cmd.exe command trying to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\" could be part of a cleanup after an attack. If \"spawn\" was a malicious task, deleting it might be an attempt to remove evidence. However, the command is using SCHTASKS to delete the task, which is a legitimate command. But the fact that it's being run in a script might be suspicious.\n\nThere are several ProcessAccess events for PowerShell, which could indicate that someone is trying to access or manipulate other processes. But again, this could be part of a legitimate script or tool.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the GitHub download, the repeated registry modifications, and the attempt to delete a scheduled task. However, none of these are definitive signs of malware. The GitHub download could be benign, and the other activities might be part of normal system operations. Without more context or indicators of compromise (like unexpected network traffic, unauthorized access, or known malicious hashes), it's hard to say this is definitely malicious. But the combination of these events might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs contain a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns Identified**\n1. **PowerShell Downloading a File from GitHub**:\n   - **Event**: `powershell.exe` downloading a file from `https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt`.\n   - **Analysis**: \n     - While downloading a `LICENSE.txt` file from GitHub is not inherently malicious, the domain and repository name (`unidade_logico`, `modulo_comum`) are not well-known or verified. This could indicate a **social engineering attempt** (e.g., masquerading as a legitimate open-source project).\n     - The use of `raw.githubusercontent.com` is common for downloading files, but it can also be exploited to host malicious payloads. Further inspection of the file content is critical.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Deletion**:\n   - **Event**: `cmd.exe` executing `SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F`.\n   - **Analysis**: \n     - Deleting a scheduled task named `\"spawn\"` might be an attempt to **remove evidence** of a malicious task. If `\"spawn\"` was previously used for persistence (e.g., executing malicious code at startup), this deletion could be part of **post-exploitation cleanup**.\n\n3. **Repetitive Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Events**: Multiple entries of `Registry value set` by `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.\n   - **Analysis**: \n     - Frequent registry changes, especially by PowerShell, could indicate **malicious configuration changes** (e.g., modifying startup entries, disabling security features, or injecting code). However, this alone is not conclusive without knowing the specific keys modified.\n\n4. **File Creation in User Directories**:\n   - **Events**: `powershell.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` creating files in user directories (e.g., `tarefa_ativo.txt`).\n   - **Analysis**: \n     - While temporary file creation is normal, the repeated creation of files with names like `\"tarefa_ativo.txt\"` (Portuguese for \"active task\") might hint at **script-based activities** or **malware persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activities**\n- **Chrome and svchost.exe Registry Changes**: These are common for updates or system operations.\n- **Windows Defender (MpDefenderCoreService.exe)**: Legitimate network activity related to antivirus operations.\n- **Whoami.exe and Cmd.exe**: Standard tools for checking user context or executing commands.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the GitHub Download**:\n   - Verify the content of the downloaded `LICENSE.txt` file. If it contains obfuscated code or malicious payloads, this would confirm a threat.\n   - Check if the domain (`unidade_logico.github.io`) is associated with any known malicious activity.\n\n2. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Check if the `\"spawn\"` task was previously present. If so, investigate its purpose and whether it was malicious.\n\n3. **Monitor Registry Changes**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Windows Event Log** to trace which registry keys were modified. Look for changes to keys related to **startup**, **security policies**, or **system services**.\n\n4. **Check File Integrity**:\n   - Use **Windows Defender** or **SIEM tools** to scan the created files (`tarefa_ativo.txt`, etc.) for malware signatures.\n\n5. **Review PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Use **PowerShell logging** or **transcripting** to analyze the commands executed by `powershell.exe` for signs of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs contain **no definitive proof of malware**, the combination of **suspicious GitHub downloads**, **scheduled task deletion**, and **repetitive registry modifications** suggests **potential compromise** or **malicious activity**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether these events are benign or part of an attack chain."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I should look through the events to see what's going on. Let's start with the first entry. It's about schtasks.exe deleting a task named \"spawn\" with the \/F flag. That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task might be part of a cleanup after an attack. But I need to check more events.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file. Not sure if that's relevant yet. Then, cmd.exe and conhost.exe are involved in registry value sets. Registry changes can be part of malware configuration, but they're common in normal operations too. \n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed, which is usually used to check the current user. That's normal, but maybe in context with other actions, it's part of something else. Then, multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed or having registry values set. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the cmd.exe processes: it's deleting a registry value under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run named \"modulo_temporario\". Deleting registry entries might be part of removing persistence mechanisms. Then there's reg.exe deleting another registry value named \"pacote_auxiliar\". That's another sign of someone trying to remove traces.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell, along with image loads of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, might indicate that PowerShell is being used to run scripts or load assemblies. The \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with empty commands might be noise or part of some tooling, but not sure.\n\nPutting this together: multiple registry deletions, use of schtasks.exe to delete a task, and heavy use of PowerShell. These could be signs of an attacker trying to remove persistence (like scheduled tasks or registry run keys) and using PowerShell for further actions. However, some of these events could be benign, like normal system maintenance. But the combination of deleting tasks and registry entries, along with PowerShell activity, makes me think this is suspicious. I should classify this as interesting with moderate confidence because while some actions are normal, the overall pattern suggests possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including deletion of scheduled tasks (spawn), registry modifications (HKCU\\\\Run keys), and frequent PowerShell usage with .NET DLL image loads, which are common in post-exploitation phases.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, the file path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Hmm, that's a legitimate Windows Defender file. Maybe a normal process, but I should check if there's anything else.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be a red flag. Why create and delete a script so quickly? Maybe trying to execute something temporarily without leaving traces.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but not sure if that's malicious here. The command line for one process is \"powershell.exe & {}\", which is an empty command. That might be a sign of something trying to obfuscate or test the system.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry value set events. PowerShell accessing the registry isn't unusual, but combined with other actions, it might be part of a larger activity. Also, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might be normal, but the frequency could be worth checking.\n\nAnother thing is the file created in the Downloads directory for winlogbeat. That's a log shipping tool, so maybe a legitimate installation. But if it's not expected, that could be suspicious. However, the user hasn't mentioned any other context, so I can't assume.\n\nThe key points here are the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script. That's a common tactic in attacks to execute malicious code without leaving evidence. Also, the multiple process accesses and registry changes might indicate lateral movement or configuration changes.\n\nBut I need to make sure these aren't normal operations. For example, PowerShell scripts are often used in legitimate tasks, but the quick creation and deletion might be a sign of something malicious. However, the confidence level here would depend on how common these events are in normal operations.\n\nConsidering all this, the combination of creating and deleting a script in Temp, along with multiple PowerShell activities, might be worth investigating. So the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nMost of the events are related to powershell.exe. There are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to system files like clrjit.dll, MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll, mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are all legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But wait, there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. Creating and deleting a script in Temp might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use Temp folders to execute malicious scripts. However, since it's immediately deleted, maybe it's just a test or part of a legitimate process.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events for powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Chrome having multiple registry changes might be normal if it's updating settings, but repeated events could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The 'Pipe Created' event is also normal, as PowerShell uses named pipes for communication.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one entry is 'powershell.exe & {}', which is an empty script block. That might be a no-op, possibly a test or a failed attempt. Another command line shows removing a file named 'objeto_principal.zip' from the Temp directory. The user might be cleaning up after a download, but again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. That's probably normal.\n\nNow, considering all these events, the majority are normal system activities. The file creation and deletion in Temp could be part of a script test or a legitimate process. The multiple registry events might be from normal operations or updates. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events and the deletion of a script might be worth investigating further. But since there's no clear indication of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms, it might not be a high priority. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. There's some suspicious activity but not enough to confirm a threat. So, the classification might be 'INTERESTING' but with a confidence around 0.6.

Alright, first, I'll scan through the events to spot any unusual patterns.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe performing actions. There's a lot of file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. For example, files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 are created and then immediately deleted. That's common in PowerShell scripts, maybe part of normal operations, but sometimes malicious scripts do that to hide their traces.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of Remove-Item commands in the command_line fields. They're deleting various .zip and .txt files in the TEMP directory. The use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests they don't want any errors to be reported, which could be a red flag. However, this might also be part of a legitimate script that's cleaning up temporary files.\n\nLooking at the other processes, there's chrome.exe and conhost.exe with registry events, but nothing too suspicious there. The whoami.exe is a standard command for checking user identity, so that's normal.\n\nThe Image loaded events for mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll seem legitimate. MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's expected. However, the fact that PowerShell is loading these might be normal if it's part of a script interacting with the system.\n\nNow, considering the combination: multiple PowerShell processes creating and deleting files in Temp, using Remove-Item with error suppression. While this could be part of a legitimate script, the repetition and the use of -ErrorAction Ignore might indicate an attempt to avoid detection. However, without more context like unexpected network activity or unauthorized access, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nBut wait, the classification needs to be based on whether the batch is interesting. Even if it's not definitively malicious, the pattern of multiple file operations in Temp with PowerShell could be worth investigating. The confidence might be around 0.6 because it's suspicious but not conclusive. However, if the user's criteria consider such activity as interesting, then it's a yes.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to 'powershell.exe'. That's common, but the combination of events might be significant. Let's check the tasks. There are several 'Image loaded' events with paths pointing to system files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. These are legitimate system files, so that's normal. However, there's also an image loaded from 'MpOAV.dll' which is part of Windows Defender. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen, there are file creation and deletion events. For example, a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be a sign of something trying to execute a script temporarily and then clean up. The command lines show Remove-Item commands on temporary files, which might be part of normal operations, but combined with the script creation, it's a bit suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell and Chrome. Chrome's registry events are repeated multiple times, but without more context, maybe they're part of normal usage. However, the fact that PowerShell is interacting with the registry could be part of legitimate activities or something more malicious.\n\nLooking at the 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if there's a lot of them or unusual ones, that might be a red flag. However, there's only one mention here, so maybe not significant on its own.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is a legitimate command, so that's probably not an issue. But the repeated PowerShell events with file creation and deletion, along with loading various DLLs, might indicate that someone is running scripts that are being cleaned up. The presence of 'MpOAV.dll' (Windows Defender) being loaded by PowerShell could be a sign of evasion techniques, trying to interact with the antivirus.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File created' event for 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' which might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities, temporary script creation and deletion, loading of system DLLs, and registry changes. While some of these are normal, the combination might indicate someone is trying to execute scripts in a stealthy manner. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads or connecting to external servers. It's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the answer is that it's suspicious but not conclusive. But I need to check if there are any red flags I missed. The fact that the same file is created and deleted quickly might be a sign of an attack, but it could also be a legitimate process. Without more data, it's hard to say, but the presence of these events together could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of normal system behavior and potential indicators of suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A PowerShell script (`objeto_padrao.txt`) is created and later deleted. While temporary script creation\/deletion can be legitimate, the rapid lifecycle (create → delete) raises suspicion, as it may indicate an attempt to execute a script without leaving persistent evidence.\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Multiple `Registry value set` events for PowerShell and Chrome. Chrome's repeated registry changes are likely benign (e.g., browser settings), but PowerShell's registry interactions could be part of legitimate automation or potentially malicious configuration changes.\n\n2. **DLL Loading:**\n   - **System DLLs:** PowerShell loads legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which are part of the .NET Framework. This is normal for PowerShell execution.\n   - **Windows Defender DLL (`MpOAV.dll`):** PowerShell loading a Windows Defender component could indicate an attempt to interact with or evade the antivirus, though this is not definitively malicious without further context (e.g., anomalous behavior during execution).\n\n3. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A single `Pipe Created` event is logged. While pipes are common for inter-process communication, this alone is not suspicious unless correlated with other anomalies (e.g., unexpected data transfer).\n\n4. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - `whoami.exe` and `chrome.exe` events are normal and do not indicate malicious activity.\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Script Obfuscation\/Cleanup:** The creation and immediate deletion of a `.ps1` script in the Temp directory could be an attempt to execute a script stealthily, a common tactic in malware.\n- **Registry and Process Interactions:** Frequent PowerShell-related events (e.g., `ProcessAccess`, `Registry value set`) may suggest automation or configuration changes, but the lack of clear malicious payloads or network activity makes it ambiguous.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **moderately suspicious** but not definitively malicious. The combination of temporary script creation\/deletion and PowerShell's system interactions warrants further investigation, such as:\n- Analyzing the contents of deleted scripts (if recoverable).\n- Correlating with network traffic or other logs for signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n- Checking for unauthorized registry changes or unexpected process behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:** Investigate further to determine if the activity is benign (e.g., automated scripts) or part of a potential attack (e.g., stealthy execution)."}

The winlog tasks are things like Registry value set and Process accessed. There are also multiple instances of whoami.exe being created, which is a normal command to check user identity.

Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting and forwarding logs, so that's a legitimate process. But then there's another file created by powershell.exe named \"pacote_ativo.txt\".
