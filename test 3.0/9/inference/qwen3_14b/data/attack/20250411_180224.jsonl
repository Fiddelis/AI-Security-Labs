{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. Hmm, there's a bunch of events here. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a process called powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not sure yet. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's creating a scheduled task with schtasks. The command line here is interesting because it's using schtasks to create a task that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That might be a red flag because attackers sometimes use names that suggest the file doesn't exist, but maybe it's a trick to avoid detection. But then again, maybe it's a typo or a real file. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for svchost.exe with registry value sets. That's common, but maybe part of normal system operations. Then, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times, which is a scheduled task. The name \"win32times\" seems a bit odd. Scheduled tasks are usually named more descriptively, but maybe that's just the name chosen here.\n\nLooking further, there's another schtasks.exe process querying the task named win32times. That's consistent with the earlier creation. Also, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of normal operations, but the presence of multiple file creations might be worth noting.\n\nThe PowerShell.exe processes are appearing multiple times, some with file creation events. The filenames like \"estrutura_geral.txt\" and \"entrada_ativo.txt\" don't have obvious malicious indicators, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it's possible that these are part of a larger activity.\n\nWait, the key thing here is the scheduled task creation. The command line in the first event has schtasks creating a daily task that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass. The -ep bypass is a PowerShell execution policy bypass, which is often used in attacks to run scripts without proper permissions. Even though the script file is named with \"NonExistingScript\", it's possible that the actual script is being downloaded or executed in another way. But the file path mentioned doesn't exist in the logs, so maybe that's a red herring.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool to check user context. Not necessarily malicious, but combined with other activities, it could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nAnother point is the multiple registry value sets on svchost.exe and chrome.exe. That might be normal, but if there's a pattern of unusual registry changes, it could indicate tampering. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this together, the most suspicious activity is the scheduled task creation with the PowerShell script using -ep bypass. Even if the script file isn't found in the logs, the act of creating a persistent task with such parameters is concerning. The presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe processes, along with the scheduled task, suggests potential malicious activity. However, without seeing the actual content of the scripts or more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the indicators like execution policy bypass and scheduled task creation, this is likely a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs contain **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Scheduled Task Creation with PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass**\n- **Event**:  \n  `cmd.exe` running `schtasks \/create` with a command line that includes:  \n  ```powershell\n  powershell -ep bypass -f C:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\n  ```\n- **Indicators**:  \n  - **`-ep bypass`**: Bypasses PowerShell's execution policy, a common tactic in attacks to run scripts without proper permissions.  \n  - **`NonExistingScript.ps1`**: The filename suggests the script might not exist locally, potentially indicating a **downloaded or obfuscated payload** (e.g., from a remote server).  \n  - **Scheduled Task**: The task (`win32times`) is created in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks`, a legitimate location but often abused by malware for persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual PowerShell and CMD Activity**\n- **PowerShell Processes**:  \n  - Multiple `powershell.exe` entries with **file creation** events (e.g., `estrutura_geral.txt`, `entrada_ativo.txt`). While not inherently malicious, the combination with the scheduled task suggests **script execution or data exfiltration**.  \n  - **`ProcessAccess` events** on `powershell.exe` may indicate attempts to monitor or manipulate the process.  \n- **`whoami.exe` Execution**:  \n  - A standard tool for checking user context, but its presence here could be part of **reconnaissance** (e.g., determining privileges).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential False Positives or Legitimate Activity**\n- **`svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe` Registry Changes**:  \n  - Common in normal system operations, but **repeated or unusual changes** could indicate tampering. No clear malicious intent here without additional context.  \n- **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation**:  \n  - A legitimate log-shipping tool. The files created (`*.yml.new`) may be part of configuration updates, but **monitoring for unexpected file modifications** is advised.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Red Flags and Recommendations**\n- **High Risk**:  \n  - The scheduled task with `-ep bypass` is a **strong indicator of a potential attack** (e.g., initial compromise, persistence, or lateral movement).  \n  - The use of `NonExistingScript.ps1` is a **tactic to evade detection** (e.g., the script may be downloaded dynamically or hidden).  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - **Check the actual content** of the script file (`C:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`) if it exists.  \n  - **Investigate the source** of the script (e.g., network connections, parent processes).  \n  - **Monitor for data exfiltration** via the created files (`estrutura_geral.txt`, `entrada_ativo.txt`).  \n  - **Review system integrity** using tools like **Windows Defender Antivirus** or **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** solutions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs suggest **malicious activity** centered around **scheduled task creation with PowerShell execution policy bypass**. While some events (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`) may be legitimate, the combination of artifacts points to a potential **security incident** requiring immediate investigation."}
