{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is often used by attackers, so I need to check the command lines.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a PowerShell command that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems like a potential indicator of someone trying to find credentials. The command is run multiple times, which might be part of a script or repeated attempts.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But the presence of multiple Image Load events could be part of a larger process, maybe a legitimate application or a malicious one masquerading as such.\n\nThere's a File Created and then immediately File Deleted event for a temporary PowerShell script. That might be a red flag. Attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious code and then delete them to cover tracks. However, the file is in the Temp directory, which is common for both legitimate and malicious activities. The name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a legitimate script, but combined with the previous search for passwords, it's worth noting.\n\nOther events include a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is part of the ELK stack for logging. Not suspicious unless there's something else. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are normal, but calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is part of normal operations, so probably okay.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events with the same command line might indicate a script that's being executed multiple times, possibly as part of an automated process. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the search for passwords using PowerShell and the temporary file creation\/deletion. These could be signs of a user trying to find credentials or an attacker's attempt to exfiltrate data. However, without more context like unexpected user behavior, lateral movement, or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence isn't extremely high, but enough to flag it for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Password Search via PowerShell**  \n   - A PowerShell command repeatedly executed (`findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt ... | select-string -Pattern password`) suggests an attempt to search for sensitive information (e.g., credentials) in files. This is a common technique used in **credential harvesting** or **data exfiltration** efforts.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**  \n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`...\/.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is created and immediately deleted. While temporary files are common, this pattern could indicate **ephemeral malicious activity** (e.g., executing a script and cleaning up traces).\n\n3. **Repetitive \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**  \n   - The same PowerShell command appears multiple times in \"Provider Lifecycle\" events. This may indicate a **script or automation tool** being invoked repeatedly, potentially for persistence or data collection.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Interactions**  \n   - While not inherently malicious, the combination of PowerShell usage, file manipulation, and repetitive commands raises concerns about **unauthorized data scanning** or **preparation for lateral movement**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activities**\n- **`whoami.exe`**: Normal for user identity checks.  \n- **`.NET DLL Loads** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`)**: Part of standard .NET runtime operations.  \n- **`winlogbeat.exe`**: A legitimate logging tool (part of the ELK stack).  \n- **`calc.exe`\/`notepad.exe`**: Common utilities; no clear malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **merit further investigation** due to the **password search activity** and **ephemeral file operations**, which could indicate **data harvesting** or **preparation for an attack**. However, these activities could also be part of **legitimate troubleshooting** or **scripting**.  \n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Correlate with user behavior (e.g., is this a known user? Are there other anomalous activities?).\n- Check for network traffic related to the PowerShell command (e.g., exfiltration).\n- Review file hashes of the temporary script (if available) for malware signatures.\n- Monitor for follow-on actions (e.g., lateral movement, privilege escalation).\n\n**Confidence Level**: Moderate (likely benign but requires deeper context)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are several PowerShell.exe processes. One of them has a command line that's searching for files containing \"pass\" or \"password\" in various file types. That seems suspicious because it could be part of a password-gathering attempt. \n\nThen there's an event where a file named MpClient.dll from Windows Defender is loaded. That's a legitimate file, but maybe it's being used in an unusual way here. However, I don't see any immediate red flags with that.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry value set events, which are common in normal system operations, but the repetition might not be significant on its own. The Chrome.exe processes have a lot of registry events and DNS queries, which could be normal browsing activity. However, the presence of multiple DNS queries might indicate some network activity that's worth checking.\n\nThe most concerning part is the PowerShell command searching for passwords. That's a common technique used by attackers to find sensitive information. Even though there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, the combination of the command and the multiple registry changes could point to something more. \n\nHowever, without more context or additional suspicious events (like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or privilege escalation attempts), it's hard to be certain. The events might be part of normal user activity or legitimate troubleshooting. \n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, especially focusing on the PowerShell command and the associated file searches.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender DLL. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Wait, Windows Defender's DLLs are usually in that directory, so maybe that's legitimate. But why is chrome.exe loading it? Maybe a false positive, but could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of them. Maybe that's normal, but repeated registry changes could indicate some kind of configuration or malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, multiple network connections detected by chrome.exe. If it's just normal browsing, that's okay. But if there's a lot of connections to unknown or suspicious IPs, that's a problem. But the logs don't mention the destination, so I can't tell yet.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. That's a common place for users to save files, but if the file is named something like 'objeto_logico.txt', it's not obviously malicious. However, the presence of PowerShell creating files might be normal, but could also be part of a script.\n\nAnother entry is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that's probably okay. But maybe the user is using it for something unusual?\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe cmd.exe process runs schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks could be part of cleaning up after an attack, or maybe just a normal maintenance. But the command line has some strange names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" which might be placeholders or actual task names. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother schtasks.exe process is creating a task, but the image loaded is taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file. So that seems normal.\n\nThe svchost.exe entry mentions a registry object added or deleted. Svchost is a common host process, but changes in the registry could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together: There's a mix of normal activities and some that are a bit suspicious. The chrome.exe loading the Defender DLL might be okay, but the multiple registry changes and network connections could be indicative of something. The use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to manipulate scheduled tasks might be part of an attempt to modify system behavior. However, without more context like IP addresses, file hashes, or user behavior, it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple events related to registry changes and network activity, along with the deletion of scheduled tasks, might suggest a potential security incident. But I need to check if there are any obvious red flags. The file paths and processes mentioned are mostly legitimate, but the combination of activities could be concerning. Maybe the user is looking for signs of a malware infection or unauthorized access. I think this batch is worth further investigation, so the answer should be yes, it's interesting.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - **Chrome.exe loading a Windows Defender DLL:**  \n     The entry `chrome.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll` from `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\...` is **potentially legitimate** (Windows Defender components are typically located here). However, **chrome.exe interacting with system DLLs** is atypical and could indicate **malware masquerading as a legitimate process** or **exploitation of a vulnerability**.\n\n   - **Frequent Registry Modifications by Chrome.exe:**  \n     Multiple `Registry value set` events by `chrome.exe` may suggest **unauthorized configuration changes** or **malware persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup entries, policies, or credentials).\n\n2. **Network Activity:**\n   - **Repeated Network Connections by Chrome.exe:**  \n     While normal for a browser, **lack of context** (e.g., destination IPs, ports, or protocols) makes it **ambiguous**. If these connections are to **unusual or malicious domains**, this could indicate **data exfiltration or C2 communication**.\n\n3. **PowerShell and CMD Activity:**\n   - **PowerShell File Creation and Registry Changes:**  \n     PowerShell creating files (e.g., `objeto_logico.txt`) and modifying the registry could be **legitimate user activity** or **part of a script-based attack** (e.g., deploying payloads, modifying system settings).\n   - **CMD.exe Deleting Scheduled Tasks:**  \n     The command `schtasks \/delete` to remove tasks named `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon` and `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup` may indicate **cleanup after an attack** or **removal of malicious scheduled tasks**. The task names (e.g., `unidade_geral_005`) are **non-descriptive and possibly obfuscated**, raising suspicion.\n\n4. **Scheduled Task Manipulation:**\n   - **Schtasks.exe and CMD.exe Interactions:**  \n     The use of `schtasks` to delete and create tasks, combined with **unusual task names**, could suggest **attempted persistence or evasion** by an attacker.\n\n5. **Legitimate Processes with Ambiguous Context:**\n   - **Winlogbeat.exe and Svchost.exe:**  \n     These are **legitimate tools** (e.g., log shipping, system services). However, their **registry modifications** or **unusual behavior** (e.g., `svchost.exe` deleting\/adding registry objects) may warrant deeper inspection.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Persistence:**  \n  Frequent registry changes and task deletions could indicate **malware attempting to maintain access** or **evade detection**.\n- **Data Exfiltration:**  \n  Unusual network activity by `chrome.exe` may suggest **data leakage**.\n- **Command-Line Obfuscation:**  \n  Task names like `unidade_geral_005` and the use of `cmd.exe`\/`schtasks` with redirection (`>nul 2>&1`) could be **tactics to hide malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with External Threat Intelligence:**  \n   Investigate the **destination IPs\/domains** of `chrome.exe` network connections and analyze the **hashes of files** created (e.g., `objeto_logico.txt`).\n2. **Inspect Registry Changes:**  \n   Use tools like **Sysinternals Process Monitor** or **Windows Event Log Analysis** to trace the **source and intent** of registry modifications by `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe`.\n3. **Analyze Scheduled Tasks:**  \n   Review the **full details** of deleted\/created tasks (e.g., `unidade_geral_005`) to determine if they were **malicious** or **legitimate**.\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement:**  \n   Investigate if the `schtasks` commands were part of **lateral movement** or **privilege escalation**.\n5. **Monitor for PowerShell Scripting:**  \n   Use **PowerShell logging** or **SIEM alerts** to detect **suspicious scripts** or **unauthorized file operations**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log entry is **potentially indicative of a security incident** (e.g., malware persistence, data exfiltration) and **requires further investigation** to confirm or rule out malicious activity. The combination of **unusual process behavior, registry changes, and task manipulation** warrants immediate attention."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is schtasks.exe deleting a task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task might be part of a cleanup after an attack. Then there are several entries involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry modifications and process accesses. \n\nI notice commands like wmic process delete and net user \/del, which could be used to remove processes or user accounts. The use of WMIC and the loading of DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll might be related to bypassing security measures. Also, multiple instances of whoami.exe could indicate checking user privileges.\n\nHowever, some of these activities could be legitimate, like normal system maintenance. But the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, and using commands to delete users and processes points towards potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell and CMD for these actions increases the suspicion. \n\nI need to check if there's a pattern here. The deletion of a scheduled task followed by registry changes and user deletions might be part of a larger attack, such as removing evidence or altering system settings.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice several processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and conhost.exe. These are common, but when combined with certain actions, they might indicate something malicious. Let me check the winlog tasks. There are multiple 'Registry value set' events, which could be normal, but maybe not. Also, there's 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. \n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c net user \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". Deleting a user account in a domain might be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger pattern. Then there's another command: \"sc delete win32times\", which deletes a service. That's unusual unless it's part of a legitimate maintenance task. \n\nAlso, there are multiple entries about User Account Management and Security Group Management. Deleting users and modifying groups could be part of an attack, like trying to remove evidence or escalate privileges. The repetition of certain commands and processes might indicate automated scripts or tools being used. \n\nHowever, some of these events could be normal administrative tasks. But the combination of deleting users, modifying registry values, and using PowerShell and cmd.exe in a way that's repetitive might suggest malicious activity. The presence of 'net1.exe' instead of 'net.exe' could be a typo or a malicious binary. \n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows signs of potential account deletion and service removal, which are red flags.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs step by step. First, I need to look for any suspicious activities. There's a lot of PowerShell activity here, which is common but can be a red flag if there's unusual behavior.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c del %%temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt >nul 2>&1 & del %%temp%%\\\\estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe >nul 2>&1\". That command is deleting temporary files, which might be normal, but the filenames have some odd names like \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\". The use of \"calc\" in the filename could be a hint, maybe related to a payload or something encoded.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where PowerShell is accessing processes and the registry. That's not necessarily bad, but combined with other actions, it might indicate something. Also, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded could be relevant. However, that's part of Windows Defender, so maybe not a threat.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a temporary script file: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1\". PowerShell scripts in temp directories can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if they're created and then deleted quickly. The fact that it's named with a test suffix might be a way to evade detection, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThere are also multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell, which might be related to the execution of scripts or modules. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThe combination of deleting files, creating temporary scripts, and using PowerShell with registry access might indicate an attempt to clean up after an attack or execute a script without leaving traces. The filenames with \"calc\" and \"decoded\" might be part of a payload or a decoded script.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any direct evidence of malicious activity. The deletion of files in the temp directory could be part of a normal process, but the presence of multiple PowerShell events accessing processes and the registry, along with the script creation and deletion, raises some flags. However, without seeing the actual content of the script or more anomalous behavior, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch shows suspicious activity that might warrant further investigation. The confidence is moderate because while there are signs of possible malicious behavior, there's not enough concrete evidence to be certain. So the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **High Frequency of PowerShell Events:** Multiple entries show PowerShell processes accessing the registry, loading .NET DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`), and interacting with files. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its frequent use in conjunction with other suspicious actions raises concerns.\n   - **Script Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. Such behavior is common in malicious scripts designed to evade detection, though it could also be part of a benign process (e.g., policy testing).\n\n2. **Command-Line Activity:**\n   - **File Deletion in Temp Directory:** The command `del %%temp%%\\estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe` deletes a file with a cryptic name (`estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe`). The inclusion of \"calc\" (a common Windows utility) and \"decoded\" suggests potential obfuscation or payload execution, though this could also be unrelated.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - **.NET DLLs Loaded:** PowerShell relies on .NET assemblies, so loading `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, and others is expected. However, the presence of **Windows Defender's `MpOAV.dll** (antivirus component) being loaded might indicate an attempt to bypass or interact with security mechanisms.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - **PowerShell Accessing Processes\/Registry:** While not inherently malicious, frequent registry access by PowerShell could indicate attempts to modify system behavior or evade detection.\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Ephemeral Files:** The creation and deletion of temporary scripts (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) may be an attempt to execute code without leaving persistent traces.\n- **Cryptic Filenames:** Files like `estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe` suggest obfuscation or encoded payloads, which are common in malware.\n- **Combination of Actions:** The sequence of script creation, execution, and deletion, paired with registry access and .NET DLL loading, aligns with tactics used in some attack chains (e.g., initial access, persistence, or data exfiltration).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **show signs of potentially malicious activity** that merit further investigation. While some actions (e.g., PowerShell usage, file deletion) are normal, the **combination of ephemeral script handling, cryptic filenames, and registry access** raises red flags. This could indicate:\n- **Malware execution** (e.g., a decoded payload being run in memory).\n- **Evasion techniques** (e.g., cleaning up artifacts post-execution).\n- **Initial access or reconnaissance** by an attacker.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Additional Data:** Check for other indicators (e.g., network traffic, user behavior, process tree) to confirm if the script was malicious.\n- **Analyze Script Content:** If the script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) was captured, its contents should be inspected for malicious code.\n- **Monitor for Similar Patterns:** Watch for repeated script creation\/deletion or PowerShell-based lateral movement.\n\n### **Final Verdict:**\n- **Classification:** `INTERESTING` (suspicious activity requiring further analysis).\n- **Confidence Level:** **0.65** (moderate risk due to ambiguous indicators, but not conclusive evidence of malicious intent). \n\nThis case underscores the importance of combining log analysis with contextual data (e.g., endpoint telemetry, network logs) to distinguish benign from malicious behavior."}

Events like \"Pipe Created,\" \"Image loaded,\" \"File created,\" and \"Registry value set.\" The file paths mentioned include things like MpClient.dll from Windows Defender and a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. Then there's also a whoami.exe being executed multiple times. \n\nHmm, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The \"Pipe Created\" event might be part of normal operations, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious. The image loaded from Defender's MpClient.dll seems normal, but maybe if there's an unusual version or context, but the path here looks legitimate.\n\nThen there's the file creation in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store data, so that's a red flag. The repeated \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which could be part of a malicious activity. \n\nAlso, the multiple executions of whoami.exe could be part of reconnaissance, trying to get user information. The presence of calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal, but if they're being used in an unexpected way, maybe that's a sign. However, those are standard system processes.\n\nWait, but there's also svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe doing registry changes. Those are normal system processes, but if they're making unexpected registry changes, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't specify what the registry changes are, so it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell activity, file creation in user directories, repeated process access events, and multiple whoami executions might indicate some form of malicious behavior. However, without more context, like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected network activity, it's a bit ambiguous.
