{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple DNS queries and network connections from chrome.exe. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not a big deal. But then I see some powershell.exe processes with ProcessAccess events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. However, just having ProcessAccess might not be enough to flag it yet.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe execution. That's a standard command to get user information, so probably benign. But接着 there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes sc.exe create and start commands. SC.exe is used to manage Windows services. The command line here is creating a service with a path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\". The path has a lot of non-English terms, which might be obfuscation. Also, the command is using \"sc.exe create\" followed by \"start\", which could be an attempt to install and immediately start a malicious service.\n\nFurther down, there are multiple entries for sc.exe creating services with paths like \"C:\\\\pacote_auxiliar\\\\registro_base\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_geral.exe\". These paths are not standard and might be part of a malicious payload. Also, the use of \"sc.exe start\" after creating the service suggests that the attacker is trying to ensure the service runs automatically.\n\nThen there are ImageLoad events for various .exe files, but the paths point to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, if these were loaded from unexpected locations, that could be a red flag, but the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe okay.\n\nLooking at the other processes: services.exe has multiple Registry value set events. Services.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's modifying registry values in a way that's unusual, that could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key suspicious points here are the use of sc.exe to create services with non-standard paths and the multiple ProcessCreate events for sc.exe and cmd.exe. These actions could be part of an attempt to persist on the system by installing a service that runs automatically. The command line arguments in the cmd.exe process are particularly concerning because they're using sc.exe to create and start a service, which is a common technique in malware for persistence.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET related DLLs might be part of a .NET application, but if those DLLs are being loaded from unexpected locations or if they're not part of known software, that could be a problem. However, in this case, the paths are standard, so it's hard to tell without more info.\n\nAnother thing is the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for these operations. While these are common tools, their use in this context, especially with sc.exe, could indicate a script-based attack. The fact that the service paths are in non-English directories might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual malicious payload.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the creation of services via sc.exe with suspicious paths and the use of command-line tools to perform these actions. These are indicators of potential malicious activity aimed at persistence. However, there's not enough information to confirm it's malicious without further analysis, like checking the actual files in those paths or looking for other indicators of compromise. But based on the logs provided, this does seem suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs contain **multiple suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n### 1. **Unusual Service Creation via `sc.exe`**\n   - **Command Example**:  \n     ```bash\n     cmd.exe \/c sc create \"unidade_base\" binPath= \"C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe\" start= auto\n     ```\n   - **Analysis**:  \n     - `sc.exe` is being used to **create and start a Windows service** with a **non-standard, obfuscated path** (`C:\\elemento_geral\\...`). This is a **common persistence mechanism** in malware.  \n     - The path contains **non-English terms** (e.g., `elemento_geral`, `modulo_geral`), which may indicate **obfuscation or evasion tactics**.  \n     - Similar patterns are repeated for other services (e.g., `modulo_geral`, `registro_base`), suggesting **system-wide persistence attempts**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Suspicious File Load Events**\n   - **Example**:  \n     ```bash\n     ImageLoad for \"C:\\Windows\\assembly\\NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64\\mscorlib\\316b66ba76e2cd70541b5fe8161637c9\\mscorlib.ni.dll\"\n     ```\n   - **Analysis**:  \n     - While `.ni.dll` files are **legitimate .NET native images**, their presence here is **not inherently malicious**. However, if these files are **unexpected** (e.g., not part of known software), they could indicate **malware packing or obfuscation**.  \n     - The logs do not explicitly show **malicious payloads**, but the combination with the `sc.exe` activity raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Abuse of Legitimate Tools**\n   - **PowerShell and `cmd.exe`**:  \n     - Multiple `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` suggest **script-based automation**.  \n     - **Risk**: These tools are often used in **malicious attacks** (e.g., downloading payloads, executing commands).  \n   - **`conhost.exe` and `modulo_secundario.exe`**:  \n     - While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, the presence of `modulo_secundario.exe` (a non-standard name) could indicate **malicious activity** if it’s not part of known software.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Registry Modifications**\n   - **Multiple `Registry value set` events** for processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `elemento_ativo.exe` suggest **attempts to modify system settings** or **persist malicious configurations**.  \n   - **Risk**: This could be part of **malware persistence or configuration changes** (e.g., disabling security tools, modifying startup entries).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **strong indicators of a potential security incident**, including:\n- **Service creation with obfuscated paths** (likely for persistence).\n- **Unusual file load events** that may indicate malicious software.\n- **Abuse of legitimate tools** for potentially malicious purposes.\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Investigate the files referenced in `sc.exe` paths** (e.g., `unidade_base.exe`, `modulo_geral.exe`) for malicious content.  \n2. **Analyze the registry modifications** to identify any unauthorized changes.  \n3. **Check for additional logs or network activity** related to these processes (e.g., outbound connections, file downloads).  \n4. **Perform a full system scan** for malware, focusing on the directories mentioned in the logs.  \n\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and should be treated as a **potential security threat** until further analysis confirms benign intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries about winlogbeat.exe creating a file at the path 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. But I should note that it's happening multiple times. \n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe triggering registry value set events and process access events. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, just seeing these events alone isn't necessarily suspicious. The key would be if there's a pattern or unusual behavior, but in this batch, it's just a few entries.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe also have registry events. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows for managing app permissions, and svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services. Their registry activity might be normal, but again, it's worth checking if there's anything unusual. \n\nNotepad.exe and calc.exe have image loaded events pointing to urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system file. However, if these processes are loading dlls from unexpected locations, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the path is the standard System32 directory. \n\nLooking at the entire batch, the main thing is the repeated file creation by winlogbeat.exe. Since winlogbeat is a known tool, this might be part of its normal operation, especially if the user is setting up or configuring it. However, if this is part of a larger set of events that include other suspicious activities, it might be more concerning. But in this case, the other events don't seem to indicate malicious activity. \n\nThe justification here would be that while there are some events that could be normal, the repeated file creation by winlogbeat.exe might be part of a setup process. However, without more context or additional suspicious events, it's not highly indicative of a security threat. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.5, since it's not clearly malicious but also not entirely benign. However, if the user is not expecting winlogbeat to be running, that could be a different story. But based solely on the given data, it's not strongly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system and application behavior (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation, standard process operations, and legitimate registry interactions). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
