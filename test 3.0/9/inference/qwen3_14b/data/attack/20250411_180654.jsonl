{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The first event is about powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_temporario.txt in the Downloads folder. That's a temporary file, maybe normal, but not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are several entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a lot of repeated events. Maybe chrome is updating something, but repeated registry changes could be a sign of something else. However, chrome doing that isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a legitimate tool to check user context, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be used to gather information.\n\nThe interesting part comes later. There's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a script that logs keystrokes to a temporary file. That's a clear sign of keylogging, which is malicious. The script is being called multiple times with different paths, but the same purpose: capturing keystrokes. \n\nAlso, there are multiple image loads related to .NET assemblies. While loading these DLLs isn't inherently bad, combined with the keylogging script, it might indicate that the attacker is using .NET to execute the malicious code.\n\nThe repetition of the same script path in different directories might be an attempt to evade detection by changing paths each time. The fact that the keylogger is being executed multiple times suggests ongoing activity.\n\nSo putting it all together: the presence of a keylogger script being executed by powershell.exe, along with multiple registry changes and .NET DLL loads, points to a potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like chrome.exe changes), the combination with the keylogger is a strong indicator of something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directory, indicating potential keylogging activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is common, but the command lines might be a red flag. Let me check the command_line fields. \n\nIn the first event, the command line is 'powershell.exe & {&\"C:\\\\modulo_padrao\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\pacote_comum\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" -LogPath $env:TEMP\\\\key.log}'. The script name is Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which sounds like it's capturing keystrokes. That's a classic sign of malware trying to steal user input. Then there's another similar command line with 'C:\\\\tarefa_base\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\entrada_temporario\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1' and another one with 'C:\\\\elemento_base\\\\unidade_temporario\\\\tarefa_principal\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1'. The same script name appearing multiple times in different paths might indicate an attempt to log keystrokes repeatedly or from different locations, which is suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's an event where the process is None and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', with a file path pointing to 'C:\\\\elemento_comum\\\\registro_principal\\\\elemento_secundario\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1'. This could be a remote execution of that same malicious script.\n\nOther events involve file creation and deletion, like the temporary files being created and then deleted. While that's not uncommon, when combined with the keystroke logging script, it might be part of a larger attack. The presence of multiple instances of the same script in different directories could be an attempt to evade detection by changing paths.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign activities. For example, there are entries related to winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is a log shipper and might be part of normal monitoring. Also, some image loads like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are part of Windows Defender, so those are likely legitimate. The svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization directory is probably part of standard Windows operations.\n\nBut the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths and the remote command execution are strong indicators of malicious intent. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these PowerShell scripts and the remote execution makes this batch interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because keystroke logging is a clear malicious activity, and the repetition suggests an ongoing attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with -LogPath parameter, indicating potential keystroke logging.
