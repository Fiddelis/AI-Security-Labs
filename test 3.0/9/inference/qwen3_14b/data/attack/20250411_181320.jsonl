{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking at the events. There's a lot of activity from chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a bunch of powershell.exe events.\n\nHmm, the powershell.exe entries have various tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDelete. The command lines show commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse', which are just listing files recursively. That's a common PowerShell command, but maybe not malicious on its own. However, the fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events and Registry value sets might indicate something. \n\nWait, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .dll files. Some of them are standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which is normal. But there's also a MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe that's okay. But the presence of multiple ImageLoads could be a sign of something, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. The file is created and then deleted quickly. That's common in scripts, but if it's part of a malicious activity, maybe. However, the command line doesn't show any obvious malicious code. The script is just listing files. \n\nAlso, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events. Not sure what those mean exactly. Maybe related to PowerShell's execution engine. But without more context, hard to say. \n\nPutting it all together: The chrome.exe activity seems benign. The PowerShell events include normal operations but in a high frequency. The FileCreate and FileDelete might be part of a legitimate script, but the repeated ProcessAccess and Registry changes could be a red flag. However, the commands themselves don't look harmful. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. Since there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, but no clear malicious indicators like downloading files, executing payloads, or accessing sensitive data. The justification might be that while there's some unusual activity, it's not conclusive enough to be classified as interesting. So maybe \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. But I need to be careful. The presence of multiple PowerShell events and file operations might be worth looking into, but without more context, it's hard to confirm. So the answer is probably not interesting, but with a note that further analysis is needed.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal and potentially noteworthy activity, but **no definitive indicators of malicious behavior** are present. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Benign Activity**\n- **Chrome.exe**: DNS queries and network connections are typical for a browser and not suspicious.\n- **PowerShell.exe**: Commands like `ls -recurse` and `get-childitem -recurse` are standard for file enumeration and do not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- **Standard DLLs**: ImageLoad events for `.NET` and Windows Defender (`MpOAV.dll`) are expected in legitimate PowerShell operations.\n\n### **Potentially Noteworthy Patterns**\n- **File Creation\/Deletion**: A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. While common in scripts, this could be part of a larger process (e.g., policy testing or cleanup).\n- **Frequent Events**: Multiple `ProcessAccess`, `RegistryEvent`, and `Provider Lifecycle` entries may suggest script execution or configuration changes, but without context (e.g., unauthorized changes, unexpected registry modifications), they are inconclusive.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity does not meet the threshold for immediate investigation (e.g., no evidence of data exfiltration, lateral movement, or exploitation). However, the **repeated PowerShell activity and file operations** could warrant further scrutiny if correlated with other anomalies (e.g., unusual user behavior, unexpected network traffic). \n\n**Final Classification**: **NOT INTERESTING** (moderate confidence).  \n**Justification**: While the logs show elevated PowerShell activity, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent or security incidents."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are several entries involving PowerShell.exe. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a point to consider.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process named powershell.exe with the task \"Image loaded\" pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender's files are usually trusted. But then there's another event where PowerShell creates a file called \"objeto_principal.txt\" in the user's Downloads folder. Creating a file isn't inherently bad, but the name is a bit generic and might be a red flag if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen, there's a command line entry for PowerShell executing \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". These are standard PowerShell commands for listing files recursively, which could be part of normal user activity. However, if this is done in a context where it's searching for sensitive information or preparing to exfiltrate data, that could be concerning.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated entries of \"File created\" events for \".winlogbeat.yml.new\" by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so creating configuration files is normal. But the repetition might be normal if it's part of a setup process.\n\nThere are several \"Registry value set\" events across multiple processes like powershell.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Changing registry values can be part of both legitimate software updates and malicious activities like persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if these are benign or malicious.\n\nThe presence of multiple \"User Account Management\" events might indicate changes to user accounts or permissions, which could be a sign of privilege escalation attempts. However, these events are logged under \"None\" for the process, which might mean they're system-level events not tied to a specific process. That could be normal or could indicate something more sinister.\n\nI also see a \"Special Logon\" event, which might be related to a user logging in, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The lack of process names for some events might be due to the logging system not capturing that information, which isn't necessarily a problem but could mean some events are less detailed.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch has a mix of legitimate activities (like Windows Defender and Winlogbeat operations) and some potentially suspicious actions (like creating files with generic names and registry changes). However, none of the events individually are clearly malicious. The confidence level is moderate because while there are some red flags, they could also be part of normal user behavior or software operations. The classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of PowerShell activities and registry changes might warrant further investigation, but it's not conclusive enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities, including file creation and registry modifications, which could indicate benign user activity or potential malicious behavior. The presence of repeated file creation events for .yml files and registry changes across multiple processes warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: calc.exe (which is a legitimate Windows calculator) has a winlog task of \"Image loaded\" with the file path pointing to urlmon.dll. That's a system file, so loading it normally isn't suspicious. But wait, the second and third events are from svchost.exe, which is a common host process for Windows services. They both have \"Registry value set\" events. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're part of a pattern, maybe something's up. However, there's no specific detail here like which registry key was modified or what the value is. Just the rule name.\n\nThe fourth event is similar to the first, but the process name is \"Calculator.exe\" instead of \"calc.exe\". That's a bit odd. Calculator.exe isn't a standard Windows process name; usually, it's calc.exe. Maybe a typo or a custom executable. The file path again is urlmon.dll, which is legitimate. But combining this with the svchost.exe registry events... Hmm.\n\nWait, but are these events indicating any malicious activity? The first and fourth events involve loading urlmon.dll, which is a normal system DLL. Unless there's something else, like the process being a different one or the DLL being from an unexpected location. But the paths here are correct. The svchost.exe events are just registry changes. Without more context, like the specific registry keys or other unusual behavior, it's hard to say. However, the presence of Calculator.exe with a different name than the standard calc.exe might be a red flag. Maybe it's a renamed malicious file. But that's just one event. The other events don't seem suspicious on their own. \n\nPutting it all together: The batch has a mix of normal system processes and events. The Calculator.exe name might be a typo, but without more evidence, it's not conclusive. The svchost.exe registry changes are common. So maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation. But I should check if there's any combination that's suspicious. Like, if the same DLL is being loaded multiple times, but that's normal. Alternatively, if the registry changes are related to the processes mentioned. But there's no direct link here. \n\nI think the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious pattern. The events are either normal or lack sufficient details to be concerning. The confidence is around 0.5, but maybe slightly lower since the Calculator.exe name is a minor red flag but not enough on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve standard system processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe) and legitimate system files (urlmon.dll). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
