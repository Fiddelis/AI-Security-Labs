{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's svchost.exe, which is normal, but also MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. Then there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, looking further down, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a user and adds them to the Domain Admins group. The command line has \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands with domain admin privileges. That's a red flag because adding users to Domain Admins is a high-privilege action and could indicate someone is trying to escalate privileges or compromise the domain.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process with a command that includes \"net1.exe\" which is not a standard Windows command. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a typo or an attempt to use a malicious binary. Also, the user names and passwords in the commands look like they could be temporary or test credentials, but the fact that they're being added to Domain Admins is concerning.\n\nLooking at the files created, there's a .winlogbeat.yml.new file and a pacote_base.txt. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but if it's part of a larger attack, maybe. However, the more critical part is the user and group modifications via the net commands.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing actions, including registry modifications. The combination of adding domain admin users, using non-standard executables like net1.exe, and modifying the registry could indicate an attack. The fact that these commands are being executed with domain admin privileges is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of commands adding users to Domain Admins, using suspicious executables, and multiple process accesses and registry changes suggests this is a security incident worth investigating. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: (1) Creation of domain admin user 'pacote_principal_Admin' with temporary password via 'net' command, (2) Addition of 'elemento_comum_Admin' to Domain Admins group, (3) Use of non-standard 'net1.exe' instead of legitimate 'net.exe', (4) Multiple registry modification events, and (5) File creation attempts that could indicate log configuration changes or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
