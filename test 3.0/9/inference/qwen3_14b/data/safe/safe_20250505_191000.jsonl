{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system files, right? But why is SDXHelper.exe doing this? I should check if that's a known legitimate process. Hmm, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's part of some software, but if it's loading system DLLs repeatedly, that could be a red flag. However, just loading system DLLs isn't necessarily malicious. Need to check more.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll. That seems normal, but the command line has some GUIDs. Not sure if that's suspicious. The svchost.exe and Registry value set events might be normal system operations. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably part of its normal operation, like configuration files. \n\nLooking at EXCEL.EXE, it's loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are related to antivirus and security features. But why is Excel loading them? Maybe it's just normal, but if there's an unusual number of loads or unexpected DLLs, that could be an issue. However, the logs don't show any errors or unexpected paths. \n\nThen there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which is a legitimate process related to WMI. The event about the Dns query from EXCEL.EXE might be normal if Excel is accessing external resources. \n\nBut wait, the SDXHelper.exe is repeatedly loading system DLLs. If that process is not known to be legitimate, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, like if it's dropping files or connecting to external IPs, it's hard to tell. The logs don't show other suspicious activities like network connections or file modifications beyond the winlogbeat file creation, which seems benign. \n\nAlso, there are several User Account Management events, but they don't have process names, which might be normal. The services.exe logon and special logon events are part of normal system operation. \n\nConsidering all this, the main points are SDXHelper.exe's behavior and the EXCEL.EXE loading security-related DLLs. However, without additional indicators of compromise, it's a bit inconclusive. Maybe the confidence should be moderate. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system DLLs by SDXHelper.exe could be suspicious, but not definitive. The other events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. So, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, but not highly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe (non-standard process) loading system DLLs (e.g., combase.dll, urlmon.dll) repeatedly, which could indicate injection or tampering.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first two entries are about Excel.exe creating a file named real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder under AppData. The path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\real_values.csv.LNK. The task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". \n\nNow, the next few entries have process set to null and task as \"None\", which might be placeholders or incomplete data. Then there are three entries where Excel.exe is performing DNS queries (rule: DnsQuery). \n\nHmm. The first thing that comes to mind is that the creation of a .LNK file in the Recent folder might be suspicious. Normally, .LNK files are shortcuts, and having them in the Recent folder could indicate that a user has opened the file recently. However, the name here is real_values.csv.LNK. Maybe the actual file is not present, and the shortcut is being created. But why would Excel be creating this? Typically, Excel might create a shortcut if the user saves a file, but maybe that's not the case here.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple DNS queries from Excel.exe could be a red flag. Excel usually doesn't perform DNS queries unless it's connecting to some online service, but if it's querying multiple domains, that might be unusual. However, without knowing the specific domains being queried, it's hard to say. The logs here don't include the DNS query details, just the rule name.\n\nNow, the first two events are the same, which might be a duplicate entry or a repeated action. The process is Excel.exe, which is a legitimate application, but if it's creating a shortcut in the Recent folder, maybe that's part of normal behavior. However, the combination of creating a shortcut and DNS queries might be worth looking into.\n\nBut wait, the .LNK file in the Recent folder is a common place for Windows to store recently opened files. So, if a user opens a CSV file, Windows might create a shortcut there. However, the fact that the file is named real_values.csv.LNK might be a red herring. If the actual file is not present, then the shortcut could be pointing to a location that's not accessible, or maybe it's a malicious file. But the logs don't mention the target of the shortcut, so that's a missing piece.\n\nThe DNS queries from Excel.exe could be normal if the user is accessing online resources, but if it's querying multiple times, that might be part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to determine. The presence of three DNS queries might be normal, but combined with the file creation, it could be a sign of something.\n\nAlso, the events with process null and task None might be errors or incomplete logs. But since they're in the batch, they might not be relevant. However, if there are a lot of those, it could indicate data collection issues. But in this case, only three entries are like that, and the rest are valid.\n\nPutting it all together: The creation of a .LNK file in the Recent folder by Excel.exe might be normal, but combined with DNS queries, it could be suspicious. However, without more data, like the target of the shortcut or the DNS query details, it's hard to be certain. The confidence here might be moderate. Maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of file creation and DNS queries from Excel could indicate an anomaly, even if it's not definitively malicious. The justification would be the unusual combination of events that might not be typical for Excel's normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Excel.exe processes created a .LNK file in the Windows Recent folder, which may indicate tracking or persistence attempts. Combined with repeated DNS queries from Excel, this suggests potential anomalous behavior warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
