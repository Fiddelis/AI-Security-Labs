This could be a sign of a malicious activity, such as a malware or a ransomware attack.\n\nTo investigate further, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. **Analyze the file names**: Look for any patterns or anomalies in the file names. In this case, all the files have similar names starting with `excel-copilot-strings_` followed by a unique string.\n2. **Check for duplicates**: There are multiple instances of each file being created. This could indicate that the process is trying to create multiple copies of the same file or is creating multiple files with similar contents.\n3. **Investigate the process**: Research the `SDXHelper.exe` process and its associated behavior. Check if it's a legitimate program or a known malware.\n4. **Monitor system activity**: Keep an eye on system logs and monitor for any suspicious activity related to this process.\n\nBased on these observations, I would recommend classifying this incident as **Potential Malware\/ Ransomware Attack**.\n\nHere is the classification with some additional information:\n\n* **Incident Type:** Potential Malware\/Ransomware Attack\n* **Description:** Multiple files with similar names and paths are being created by the process `SDXHelper.exe`.
