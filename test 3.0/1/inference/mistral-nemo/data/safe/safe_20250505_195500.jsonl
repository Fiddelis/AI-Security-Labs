This is likely an Microsoft Office component or service.\n\n2. **Task**: The task performed by this process in all the events is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that the process is creating new files.\n\n3. **Files Created**:\n   - The files being created are related to `officeaicopilot-strings.min`. These are likely minified JavaScript files used by Microsoft Office for its web-based components.\n   - Each file has a unique hash (e.g., `4091ebb427771cbae3cfbb9d0093889a`) in their names, suggesting that these are different versions or instances of the same resource.\n\n4. **Location**: All files are being created in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n\n5. **Event Timestamps**: The events are not sequential, and there's no pattern suggesting a regular interval between file creations. This suggests that these files might be created on-demand or as needed by Microsoft Office.\n\n6. **Possible Reason**: Microsoft Office might be updating its offline resources (used for features like working offline or in scenarios with limited internet connectivity) based on user actions, software updates, or other triggers.\n\nIn summary, the `SDXHelper.exe` process is creating minified JavaScript files related to `officeaicopilot-strings.min` as part of its regular operation. This is likely a normal behavior of Microsoft Office and not indicative of any security threats or system issues."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, here's a summary of what happened:\n\n1. **File Creation Events (SDXHelper.exe):**\n   - A total of 13 'officeaicopilot-strings.min' files were created in rapid succession by the process `SDXHelper.exe`. These files were saved to the following directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n   - The file names follow a pattern of 'officeaicopilot-strings.min_[hash].js', suggesting they might be related to Office's AI Copilot feature, and the hashes indicate they are different versions or variations.\n   - These events happened at around the same time (likely within minutes), indicating rapid sequential creation of these files.\n\n2. **Registry Event (chrome.exe):**\n   - A single registry value was set by the process `chrome.exe`. This event seems unrelated to the file creation events and occurred sometime after them, as indicated by the different process name (`chrome.exe` vs `SDXHelper.exe`).\n\nHere are a few possible interpretations of these events:\n\n- **Office Update\/Installation:** The rapid creation of these JavaScript files could be part of an Office update or installation process, specifically related to the AI Copilot feature. The `SDXHelper.exe` process is known to be used by Microsoft for managing Office add-ins and updates.\n\n- **Temporary Files:** These files might be temporary and could be deleted after use. Their purpose could be data caching, preparation for an upcoming task, or something else related to Office's AI Copilot feature.\n\n- **No Malicious Activity Detected:** Given the known processes involved (`SDXHelper.exe` and `chrome.exe`) and the types of events (file creation and registry value set), there's no immediate indication of malicious activity in these logs. However, without more context or a deeper analysis, it's difficult to definitively rule out any potential security concerns.\n\nTo gain more insight, you might want to consider the following steps:\n\n- Check if there were any other related events (e.g., process start\/stop, network activity) around this time.\n- Monitor for further changes to these files or new file creations in the same directory.\n- Review Office update logs and AI Copilot feature history to understand if these activities align with known behaviors."}

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this:\n\n1. **Check for corrupt or outdated Office components:**\n   - Run the Office Online Repair tool (available through the Programs and Features section in Control Panel) to fix any corrupt Office components.\n   - Ensure that your Office software is up-to-date by checking for updates within the software itself or using Windows Update.\n\n2. **Delete the problematic folder and recreate it:**\n   - Close all Office applications.\n   - Delete the `Offline Files` folder located at `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`.\n   - Reopen Microsoft Office, it should recreate the folder automatically.\n\n3. **Monitor for excessive file creation:**\n   - Use a monitoring tool like Process Explorer (available from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite) to keep track of the processes creating these files and how often they're being recreated.\n   - Check if there are any other processes or services interfering with Office operations that could be causing this issue.\n\n4. **Check for any recent changes or installations:**\n   - If you've recently installed new software, updates, or made significant system changes, those might be triggering this behavior. Revert any recent changes and see if the issue persists.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it would be helpful to gather more detailed logs or reach out to Microsoft Support for further assistance."}

Investigate the new Run key entry and remove any unauthorized programs configured to run at startup.\n2. Scan the system using up-to-date antivirus software to identify and remove any malicious files or infections that may have created unexpected files.\n3. Review and investigate the newly created firewall rule allowing connections to the unknown IP address on port 443, as it could potentially indicate unauthorized outbound communication with a malicious host.\n\n**Analysis Confidence:** Medium - High"}
