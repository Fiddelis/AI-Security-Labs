{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to Chrome.exe making network connections. That's normal, right? Browsers often connect to the internet. But there are a few other processes here. There's PowerShell.exe being accessed multiple times, which could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used in attacks. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool but might be used maliciously if it's not expected.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that's running csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. The command line seems suspicious because it's compiling a .cs file into an executable and then running another exe from the temp directory. That's a common tactic in malware to execute code without leaving obvious traces. The temp directory is a red flag because attackers often use it to store malicious files.\n\nThen there are several FileCreate and FileExecutableDetected events. The files are being created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. The names like \"pacote_logico.exe\" and \"unidade_padrao.exe\" don't seem to be standard system files. Also, the ImageLoad events for executables like \"registro_padrao.exe\" and \"modulo_secundario.exe\" might indicate that these are being loaded into memory, possibly as part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell and cmd.exe could indicate that these processes are being manipulated or accessed in an unusual way. Also, the Registry value set events might suggest changes to the registry, which is another common attack vector.\n\nPutting this all together, while some events are normal (like Chrome's network activity), the combination of suspicious file creations in temp directories, unusual process executions, and multiple registry changes points towards potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the context and the number of suspicious events make this batch worthy of further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: compilation of custom executables in temp directories (csc.exe), execution of unknown binaries (registro_padrao.exe, modulo_secundario.exe), frequent PowerShell\/cmd process access, and registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential malware execution or persistent mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate system file, so maybe normal. But then there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be a red flag. However, svchost is often used by malware to hide activities, so repeated registry changes could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. The correct one is calc.exe. Maybe a typo, but could also be a renamed malicious executable. That's a point to note.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal during setup. But the path seems like a temporary file (.new), which might be part of the installation process. Not immediately suspicious, but worth checking.\n\nThen ApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe doing registry changes. PowerShell is common for administrative tasks, but if it's being used in a way that's unusual, like modifying registry values without a clear reason, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't provide context on what exactly is being changed.\n\nChrome.exe has a lot of entries here. It's loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate files related to Windows Defender. But there are also multiple registry changes. Chrome is a common target for malware, so if it's doing a lot of registry modifications, that might indicate something's wrong. However, Chrome updates or extensions could cause such changes. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but the frequency might be a concern.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple registry changes by various processes, some legitimate ones like svchost and chrome, but also some that might be suspicious like Calculator.exe. The presence of winlogbeat creating a file could be normal, but maybe the user is setting up monitoring, which is good. However, the repeated registry events might indicate some automated process or potential tampering.\n\nBut wait, the justification needs to be concise. The main points are the multiple registry modifications by svchost, chrome, and others, along with the Calculator.exe which might be a typo. However, without more data (like the actual registry keys being modified, user context, etc.), it's hard to be certain. The confidence level should be moderate because while there are a lot of events, they might be part of normal operations. However, the combination of multiple registry changes and the presence of Calculator.exe (which could be a typo for calc.exe) might be enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe, combined with Calculator.exe (possible typo for calc.exe) loading system DLLs, suggest potential malicious activity or anomalous behavior requiring deeper analysis.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
