{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the processes mentioned. There's chrome.exe, which is normal, but there's also whoami.exe and cmd.exe with certutil commands. Wait, certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding files, which can be part of malicious activities like hiding payloads. \n\nLooking at the cmd.exe command line: it's using certutil to encode calc.exe into a temporary file and then decode it again. That seems suspicious because encoding a legitimate file like calc.exe might be a way to obfuscate malicious code. Also, there are multiple certutil processes creating and decoding files in the Temp directory. \n\nThen there's the File created events for .yml.new and executable files in Temp. The presence of multiple certutil operations, especially with decoding, could indicate an attempt to execute a payload. Also, the registry events might be part of persistence or configuration changes. \n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll â€“ those are system files, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nHowever, there are also normal processes like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe. But the combination of certutil's use here, along with the file operations in temporary directories, suggests potential malicious activity. The user might be trying to encode and decode files to execute something, which is a common tactic in malware. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of certutil with encoding\/decoding, multiple file creations in temp folders, and registry changes could indicate an attack. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation. Confidence is around 0.8 because while some events are normal, the combination of certutil usage and file operations in temp directories is suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potential payload obfuscation), creation of temporary executable files in user directories, and frequent registry modifications. These patterns are commonly associated with malware operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are seven entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Chrome modifying the registry might be normal, but doing it multiple times could be suspicious. However, I know that Chrome sometimes updates its own settings, so maybe that's not a red flag on its own.\n\nThen there's an entry for SDXHelper.exe with the task \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" and the file path is urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard process, that might be concerning. However, SDXHelper.exe could be part of some software, but I'm not sure. Need to check if that's a known malicious process.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, so creating a configuration file there seems normal. The file path looks like a typical setup for a new installation, so probably not suspicious.\n\nThen there are three entries for powershell.exe with tasks \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\". PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activities. Multiple registry modifications and process accesses could indicate something like a script trying to alter system settings or access other processes. However, PowerShell is also used for legitimate administrative tasks, so this isn't conclusive on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from Chrome and PowerShell. Chrome's registry changes might be benign, but the PowerShell activities, especially multiple registry modifications and process accesses, could be indicative of malicious behavior. The SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll might be a red herring if it's legitimate, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell events with registry and process access tasks is more concerning. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity (like unauthorized access, suspicious file paths, or known malware), it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence here is moderate, maybe around 0.6. The classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the PowerShell activities are suspicious, but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes performing registry modifications and process access tasks, which are often associated with malicious activities. While Chrome and SDXHelper.exe events are less concerning individually, the combination of PowerShell events raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
