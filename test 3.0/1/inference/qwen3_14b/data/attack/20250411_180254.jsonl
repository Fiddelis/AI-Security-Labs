{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several processes involved, like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and others. Some of the events are about registry value sets, process creations, and image loads. Let me check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries, there's one with a command line that runs \"systeminfo & reg query HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum\". That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's disk configuration. That's a common tactic in reconnaissance.\n\nThen there's the systeminfo.exe process, which is normal, but the image loaded includes amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, but if it's being loaded by systeminfo.exe, maybe that's normal? Or could it be a sign of something else? Not sure yet.\n\nAnother thing is the svchost.exe processes creating files in the Windows Event Logs directory. Creating new event logs might be unusual. Also, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a new .yml file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal if it's part of setup, but maybe not if it's unexpected.\n\nThere are multiple registry events, which could be part of normal operations, but combined with the process creations and the file creations, it might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or install something. The presence of powershell.exe and cmd.exe running commands to query the registry and system info is common in initial access or information gathering phases of an attack.\n\nAlso, the WmiPrvSE.exe process is involved, which is related to WMI. WMI is often used by attackers for remote management and execution. The image load of wmiutils.dll is normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nI should check if there are any unusual file paths or unexpected processes. The file created by svchost.exe in the winevt Logs directory might be a red flag if it's not part of regular system activity. Also, the winlogbeat file creation could be part of a log collection setup, but if it's not expected, that's suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of system information gathering, registry modifications, and file creation in system directories might indicate a potential security incident. The presence of multiple registry events and process creations could be signs of an attacker probing the system. However, some of these processes are legitimate, so I need to weigh the likelihood. The confidence isn't 100% certain, but enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: system information gathering (systeminfo, reg query), registry modifications, and unusual file creation in system directories (winevt Logs). Processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and svchost.exe involved in potential reconnaissance or configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what each event is indicating.\n\nLooking at the JSON entries, most of them involve 'chrome.exe' and 'winlogbeat.exe' with tasks related to registry value sets and file creation. There's also one entry with 'Calculator.exe' and another with 'powershell.exe'. \n\nThe first thing that stands out is the high number of registry value set events from chrome.exe. Typically, registry changes can be normal, but when they're frequent and from a process like chrome, it might be suspicious. However, I should check if there's any specific malicious activity here.\n\nThen, there's an entry where chrome.exe loads 'amsi.dll' from the System32 directory. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading it is normal, but maybe if it's being loaded from an unexpected location or in an unusual context. However, in this case, the path is 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\amsi.dll', which is the correct location. So that might be legitimate.\n\nAnother entry shows chrome.exe loading 'MpOAV.dll' from the Windows Defender Platform directory. Again, that's a legitimate path. So those image loaded events might not be suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a file created event by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a new .yml file in its data directory could be part of normal configuration updates, but the filename has a '.new' extension, which might indicate a temporary file. Not sure yet, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen, there's a file created by powershell.exe with the path 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\objeto_padrao.txt'. Creating a text file in the Downloads folder isn't unusual, but the name 'objeto_padrao.txt' doesn't seem to indicate anything malicious. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, maybe.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority are from chrome.exe doing registry changes. While registry modifications can be part of normal operations, especially if the browser is updating settings, the sheer volume might be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. \n\nThe presence of legitimate DLLs being loaded doesn't point to malware. The file creation events seem normal. The only thing that might be concerning is the number of registry events from chrome.exe. But is that enough to classify as interesting?\n\nIn cybersecurity, it's important to consider the context. If this is part of a normal user's activity, maybe not. But if the system is supposed to be secure and there's no known reason for such changes, it might be worth investigating. \n\nHowever, the justification for classification needs to be concise. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity—like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or known malicious DLLs—the batch might not be interesting. The events don't show clear signs of compromise. Therefore, the classification would be 'NOT INTERESTING' with moderate confidence, as the events are mostly normal but could be part of a larger context that requires more data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal operations like registry modifications, DLL loading, and file creation. No suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or high-risk activities are detected in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
