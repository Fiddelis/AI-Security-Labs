{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's powershell.exe involved. Let me check the commands.\n\nOne of the entries has a powershell.exe command_line that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub raw URL. The URL is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_base\/objeto_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" and saves it to the temp directory. That seems like a normal activity, but wait, there are multiple similar entries with different GitHub URLs. The command_line is using DownloadFile, which is a common method for downloading files, but in PowerShell, this can be part of malicious activities like downloading payloads.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple ImageLoads might be part of a larger process. However, the key thing here is the repeated use of WebClient to download files from GitHub. GitHub is a common source for benign code, but if the files being downloaded are not expected or if they're being executed, that could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the FileCreate and FileDelete events. A temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. This might be part of a script that's executing and cleaning up, which could be normal, but combined with the downloads, it might indicate something more. Also, the command_line entries have similar structures, which might suggest a pattern or automated process.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the batch is to be considered as a whole. The presence of multiple downloads from GitHub via PowerShell could be part of a legitimate process, like fetching scripts or configuration files. However, the repetition of such events, especially if they are from different repositories, might indicate that the system is being used to download multiple files, possibly for malicious purposes. However, without more context, like the actual content of the downloaded files or other suspicious activities, it's hard to be certain.\n\nBut the classification is whether it's interesting for investigation. The key points here are the multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub and the associated file operations. While these activities can be legitimate, they might also be indicative of a script that's being used to fetch and execute code, which is a common tactic in attacks. Therefore, this batch might be interesting enough to warrant further investigation to determine if these activities are part of a benign process or a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub repositories using WebClient, which could indicate legitimate activity or potential malicious behavior (e.g., downloading payloads).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any patterns or suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several entries involving PowerShell.exe with command lines that use WebClient.DownloadFile from GitHub URLs. That's a red flag because downloading files from external sources, especially using PowerShell, is common in attacks. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files, which might be benign, but the fact that they're being downloaded to temporary directories could be part of an attack.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries where Chrome.exe is setting registry values. While Chrome might legitimately modify the registry, the repetition of this event (12 times) could indicate something unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. \n\nLooking at the other processes, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new, which is related to Winlogbeat, a log shipper. That might be part of normal operations if someone is configuring it. However, the repeated file creation by winlogbeat.exe could be a sign of tampering if it's unexpected.\n\nAnother point is the presence of the process 'MpDefenderCoreService.exe' with a network connection detected. That's part of Windows Defender, so that's probably normal. But if there were unexpected connections, that would be a concern.\n\nThe 'conhost.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe' entries are also standard system processes, so their registry modifications might be normal. However, the multiple 'Registry value set' events might be worth checking, but not necessarily a threat on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub. Even though the files are LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign, the use of PowerShell for downloading and executing such files could be part of a larger attack. The repetition of similar commands and the use of temporary directories might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving obvious traces.\n\nHowever, since the URLs are from GitHub and the files are named as LICENSE.txt, which are common in open-source projects, it's possible they are legitimate. But in the context of security monitoring, any download from an external source using PowerShell should be investigated further. The other events, while numerous, don't immediately point to malicious activity unless they are out of the norm for the system in question.\n\nSo, the answer is that the logs are somewhat suspicious due to the PowerShell activities, but without more context, it's not conclusive. However, the presence of those downloads is enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain several suspicious indicators that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activity:**\n1. **PowerShell Download Commands**  \n   Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing commands like:  \n   ```powershell\n   WebClient.DownloadFile(\"https:\/\/github.com\/...\/LICENSE.txt\", \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...\")  \n   ```  \n   - **Why this matters**: Downloading files from external URLs (even GitHub) using PowerShell is a common tactic in **living-off-the-land** attacks. While `LICENSE.txt` files are typically benign, this could be a precursor to executing malicious payloads or exfiltrating data.  \n   - **Red flag**: The use of temporary directories (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`) suggests an attempt to avoid leaving obvious traces.\n\n2. **Repetitive Registry Modifications**  \n   - **Chrome.exe** and **other processes** (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`) repeatedly set registry values.  \n   - **Why this matters**: While registry changes are normal, **12 identical \"Registry value set\" events** for Chrome could indicate **unauthorized configuration changes** or **malware persistence** (e.g., injecting code into browser processes).\n\n3. **Winlogbeat File Creation**  \n   - Repeated `winlogbeat.exe` events creating `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files.  \n   - **Why this matters**: If Winlogbeat is not configured on the system, this could indicate **tampering** with log shipping tools or **malware mimicking legitimate processes**.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Concerning Activity:**\n- **MpDefenderCoreService.exe Network Connections**: Likely legitimate (part of Windows Defender).  \n- **Notepad.exe\/Other System Processes**: Minor registry changes are common for system processes.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **show signs of potential malicious activity** (PowerShell downloads, repetitive registry changes) but **require additional context** (e.g., whether the GitHub URLs are benign, if Winlogbeat is expected, or if the system is under attack). This would be a **high-priority alert** in a security monitoring scenario.  \n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- Investigate the PowerShell commands and downloaded files (e.g., check hashes, contents).  \n- Verify if Winlogbeat is expected on the system.  \n- Monitor for lateral movement or data exfiltration via the network connection detected by `MpDefenderCoreService.exe`."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. Hmm, the first entry is about calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but loading urlmon.dll might not be suspicious on its own. But then there's a lot of activity with svchost.exe and Registry value sets. svchost.exe is normal, but if it's modifying the registry a lot, that could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a Calculator.exe loading the same urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. Maybe that's a typo or a renamed malicious file. The path is System32, which is legitimate, but the process name being Calculator.exe is odd. Could be a dropper or something.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The command lines include things like SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F, which is deleting a task named \"spawn\". That might be part of cleaning up after creating a scheduled task. Also, there's a REG DELETE command in the logs, trying to delete a registry key. That's suspicious because attackers often modify the registry to persist.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a line where cmd.exe is running SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn\". Then another cmd.exe instance is deleting a registry value called \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". These names don't look standard. They might be part of an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there's a conhost.exe process with registry modifications. Conhost is related to console windows, but again, multiple registry changes could indicate something's wrong. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for registry and task modifications points towards persistence mechanisms being used by an attacker.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of unusual process names (Calculator.exe), multiple registry modifications, use of SCHTASKS and REG commands, and the presence of PowerShell and cmd.exe executing these commands suggests that this is likely a malicious activity. The attacker is trying to persist on the system by modifying the registry and scheduled tasks, and then cleaning up by deleting those entries. The presence of both registry changes and scheduled task deletions is a strong indicator of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate **malicious activity** involving **registry manipulation**, **scheduled task deletion**, and **suspicious process execution**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n\n1. **Unusual Process Names:**\n   - **`Calculator.exe`** (not a standard Windows process) loading **`urlmon.dll`** (a legitimate DLL but often abused in attacks). This may indicate a **dropper** or **malware** disguised as a legitimate process.\n\n2. **Registry Tampering:**\n   - **`REG DELETE`** commands targeting **`HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`** (a common persistence mechanism). The registry keys **`modulo_temporario`** and **`pacote_auxiliar`** are likely malicious entries being removed to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Scheduled Task Deletion:**\n   - **`SCHTASKS \/DELETE \/TN spawn`** suggests an attacker is **cleaning up** after creating a malicious scheduled task named **`spawn`**, which may have been used for persistence or payload execution.\n\n4. **Abuse of Legitimate Tools:**\n   - **`cmd.exe`**, **`powershell.exe`**, and **`reg.exe`** are being used to execute commands, which is common in **post-exploitation phases** (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence).\n\n5. **Frequent Process Execution:**\n   - Repeated execution of **`whoami.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`** (often used in command-line interfaces) may indicate **information gathering** or **attempting to maintain access**.\n\n---\n\n### **Likely Attack Scenario:**\n- An attacker has **compromised the system** and is **modifying the registry** to establish persistence (e.g., adding entries to `Run` keys).\n- They are **deleting evidence** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks) to avoid detection.\n- The use of **`Calculator.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`** may be part of **process injection** or **masquerading** to evade detection.\n- **PowerShell** and **cmd.exe** are being used for **command execution** and **task management**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Investigate the source** of the `Calculator.exe` process (check file hashes, digital signatures, and parent processes).\n2. **Check for other malicious entries** in the registry (e.g., `HKCU`, `HKLM`, or `HKCR`).\n3. **Audit scheduled tasks** for anomalies (e.g., tasks named \"spawn\" or other suspicious names).\n4. **Monitor PowerShell and cmd.exe activity** for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n5. **Isolate the affected system** and perform a full forensic analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log data strongly suggests **malicious activity** aimed at **persistence, cleanup, and evasion**. Immediate investigation and remediation are required to prevent further compromise."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries with tasks like 'Process accessed', 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'.

The creation of a temporary script file, followed by deletion, and multiple image loads. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity like accessing sensitive files, network connections, or unusual registry changes. The presence of .NET DLLs is expected. The justification for being interesting might be the temporary file creation and deletion, but without more evidence like suspicious commands or network traffic, it's not conclusive.

But then there's multiple instances of PowerShell being accessed and registry values being set. \n\nWait, the command line for one of the PowerShell processes is \"powershell.exe & {}\". That seems odd. The \"{}\" might be a placeholder or part of a script, but it's not clear.

Creating and deleting a script file quickly could be part of a malicious activity, like executing a script temporarily to avoid leaving traces. Also, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded might indicate some interaction with the antivirus, but it's not necessarily bad unless there's something else.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell might suggest that another process is interacting with it, which could be benign or malicious. The Registry value sets might indicate changes to system settings, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, the fact that there's a script file created and deleted in the Temp folder, along with multiple PowerShell executions and image loads related to .NET, could be indicative of a script being run that's trying to bypass security policies.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's Calculator.exe, which is normal, but then a lot of powershell.exe and chrome.exe entries. Chrome usually isn't involved in registry changes or pipe creations, so that might be a red flag. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Pipe Created, Process accessed, and Image loaded. \n\nLooking at the powershell.exe events, there's a command line that says \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems empty, maybe a placeholder or a mistake.

PowerShell is loading various .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell when running scripts, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might indicate that a script is executing that requires these DLLs. However, the path C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform... has MpClient.dll being loaded. That's part of Windows Defender, so maybe that's legitimate, but it's worth checking if it's expected.\n\nThen there's a command line that tries to remove a file named objeto_principal.zip from the TEMP directory. The user might be cleaning up after some activity, but if this is part of a malicious process, it could be hiding evidence. Also, the use of Remove-Item with ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is trying to delete a file without causing errors if it doesn't exist, which might be a way to avoid detection.\n\nThe repeated Registry value set events for chrome.exe are unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much unless it's being manipulated. This could indicate that an attacker is trying to change Chrome's settings or inject code through the registry.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool to check the current user, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack, like checking privileges before executing a payload.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell events, registry modifications by Chrome, file creation in user directories, and image loading of .NET components. While some of these could be normal, the combination and the specific actions (like deleting a zip file, registry changes by Chrome) might indicate a potential security incident.

The first event shows a PowerShell command removing a file from the TEMP directory. Then there are several image loads related to .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for PowerShell, but maybe there's something else here.\n\nWait, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1.

The repeated use of Remove-Item on temporary files could be part of an attack lifecycle. However, without more context, like known bad indicators or network activity, it's a bit tricky. But the combination of these events does raise suspicion enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Manipulation**: Multiple `Remove-Item` commands targeting temporary files (e.g., `unidade_base.txt`, `registro_auxiliar.txt`, `pacote_ativo.txt`) with `ErrorAction Ignore` to suppress errors. This is consistent with **cleanup operations** to remove evidence of transient files, which is **common in malicious payloads** (e.g., post-exploitation or persistence mechanisms).\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion**: A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted, suggesting **ephemeral script execution**—a tactic used to avoid leaving forensic traces.\n\n2. **Image Loading**:\n   - **.NET Framework DLLs**: PowerShell loads standard .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which is **normal** for PowerShell execution.\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs**: Loading `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (part of Windows Defender) could indicate **interaction with antivirus software**, possibly to bypass detection or analyze its behavior.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving PowerShell and `conhost.exe` suggest **potential persistence mechanisms** or configuration changes. However, without context on the registry keys modified, this remains inconclusive.\n\n4. **Legitimate Tools**:\n   - **Winlogbeat**: The creation of a `.yml.new` file by `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) is **normal** for configuration updates. However, the presence of this tool might indicate **monitoring or logging infrastructure**, which could be legitimate or part of a red team exercise.\n\n5. **User Enumeration**:\n   - `whoami.exe` execution is a **common reconnaissance tool** to identify the current user context. While benign alone, it may be part of a broader attack chain (e.g., privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns**\n- **Ephemeral File Operations**: The combination of file creation\/deletion and error suppression (`ErrorAction Ignore`) is a **red flag** for **malicious cleanup** or **script obfuscation**.\n- **Repetitive Temporary File Deletion**: Multiple `Remove-Item` commands targeting files with names like `pacote_ativo.txt` and `estrutura_padrao.txt` (Portuguese for \"active package\" and \"standard structure\") could indicate **custom malware** or **script-based attacks**.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose**: The absence of clear justification for these operations (e.g., no corresponding legitimate application activity) raises concerns about **unauthorized access** or **malicious scripting**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains) or **process injection** during these events.\n   - Investigate **registry changes** to identify modified keys or values that could indicate persistence (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Use **PowerShell logging** (e.g., `Transcript` or `ScriptBlockText` logs) to reconstruct the full script content, if available.\n\n3. **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:\n   - Scan for **known malicious file hashes** or **YARA rules** matching the deleted files (`objeto_padrao.txt`, `pacote_ativo.txt`).\n   - Monitor for **unusual PowerShell module usage** (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`).\n\n4. **Assess Winlogbeat Context**:\n   - Confirm if `winlogbeat.exe` is part of a **legitimate monitoring system** or if its presence is **unexpected** (e.g., in a non-logging environment).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `.NET` image loading, `whoami.exe`) is benign, the **pattern of ephemeral file operations, cleanup, and lack of clear purpose** suggests **potential malicious behavior**. This warrants **further investigation** to rule out **unauthorized access**, **malware execution**, or **data exfiltration**."}

The events don't include network connections, privilege escalations, or data exfiltration. The 'whoami.exe' is just running, which is normal. The 'pacote_ativo.txt' might be a harmless file, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, the fact that PowerShell is being accessed multiple times could indicate someone trying to run scripts. But again, without seeing the actual commands or payloads, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple events might be normal system behavior, but the combination of these events could be part of a larger attack. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, maybe it's not interesting enough.\n\nWait, but the classification is about whether the batch is relevant for investigation. If there's a pattern that's unusual, even if not clearly malicious, it might be worth looking into. The repeated registry changes by Chrome and RuntimeBroker might be benign, but the multiple PowerShell accesses and whoami executions could be part of something. However, without more context, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can spot that the events don't form a clear attack chain. The presence of 'whoami.exe' is normal, and the file creation might be part of a legitimate process. The PowerShell events might be part of system administration tasks. So, maybe this batch isn't interesting enough to warrant an investigation. \n\nBut I should check again. The key here is that the events don't show a clear malicious pattern. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The activities are within normal operations, even if they're a bit frequent. Therefore, the classification might be 'NOT INTERESTING' with moderate confidence, as the events don't clearly point to malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine process activity (e.g., chrome.exe registry changes, whoami.exe executions, and file creations) without clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior. PowerShell access and file creation are common in legitimate workflows.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
