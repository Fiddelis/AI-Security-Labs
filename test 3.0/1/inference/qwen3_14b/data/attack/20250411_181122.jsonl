{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. The first entry is 'whoami.exe', which is a normal command to check the current user. But then there's multiple instances of PowerShell being executed. The command line for one of them is interesting: it's using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in various file types. That seems suspicious because searching for passwords in files could be part of a data extraction attempt.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, which are loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with other activities, maybe not. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be part of an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line could indicate that the process is being monitored or there's some logging happening, but since they're all the same, maybe it's just a normal operation. However, the fact that the same command is logged multiple times might be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's normal if it's being set up. However, if this is part of a larger pattern of data exfiltration or log tampering, it could be concerning. But in this batch alone, there's not enough to confirm that.\n\nThe 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' events are normal processes, and loading urlmon.dll is standard for some operations. So those might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple image loads could indicate an attempt to search for sensitive information. However, without more context, like network activity or other suspicious processes, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of these events does raise some flags that might warrant further investigation. I think the classification here should be 'INTERESTING' with moderate confidence because while some activities are normal, the pattern of searching for passwords and temporary file handling is suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The log shows multiple suspicious activities: 1) Repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords in files (findstr + select-string), which could indicate data extraction. 2) A temporary file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory, suggesting potential script execution obfuscation. 3) Multiple 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs associated with PowerShell, which while normal, combined with other activities raises flags. 4) Repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with identical command lines, potentially indicating process monitoring or logging anomalies.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events to see if there's any suspicious activity. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event mentions powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, as Defender's DLLs are legitimate. But I should note that.\n\nThe second event has a command line using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. That's a common technique for password spraying or data exfiltration. The command is looking for 'pass' in various file types and then using select-string with a password pattern. This might be a red flag.\n\nThen there are several events with svchost.exe and Registry value set. svchost is a normal system process, but multiple registry changes could be suspicious if they're modifying critical keys. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Calculator.exe events seem normal, loading urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows. The findstr.exe process is also part of the command mentioned earlier, which is searching for passwords. That's a bit concerning.\n\nThere are multiple powershell.exe events with tasks like Process accessed and Registry value set. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so frequent use here might be suspicious. The File created event in the user's AppData directory could be a sign of persistence or data storage.\n\nThe OfficeClickToRun.exe doing a DNS query is normal for Office updates, but again, need to check if it's unusual. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory might be part of a legitimate log setup, but if it's unexpected, it could be a problem.\n\nLooking at the Chrome.exe events, there are a lot of Registry value sets and DNS queries. Chrome's normal behavior includes DNS lookups, but excessive activity might indicate something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious part is the PowerShell command searching for passwords in files. That's a classic sign of an attacker trying to find credentials. Also, the multiple PowerShell and Registry events could indicate attempts to modify system settings or establish persistence.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, Windows Defender's DLLs are normal, and Chrome's DNS queries are common. The key is whether these activities are out of the ordinary for the system in question.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided context about the environment, I have to rely on the logs alone. The presence of password search commands and multiple PowerShell activities raises suspicion enough to classify this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** INTERESTING  \n**Justification:** The log contains multiple suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Key indicators include:  \n1. **PowerShell command searching for passwords**: The `findstr` and `select-string` commands in the log (e.g., `find -type f -name \"*.txt\" -exec grep -l \"pass\" {} \\;`) suggest an attempt to locate files containing sensitive information (e.g., passwords). This is a common tactic in data exfiltration or credential harvesting.  \n2. **Unusual file creation**: A file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is created in the user's Downloads directory by `winlogbeat.exe`, which could indicate tampering with log configurations or data exfiltration.  \n3. **Frequent registry modifications**: Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` may signal attempts to modify system behavior or inject malicious code.  \n4. **High volume of Chrome-related events**: Excessive DNS queries and registry changes by `chrome.exe` could indicate abnormal activity, such as network reconnaissance or malware persistence.  \n\nWhile some events (e.g., `chrome.exe` DNS queries, `svchost.exe` registry changes) may be benign, the combination of password searches and file\/registry anomalies raises a high risk of compromise.  \n\n**Confidence:** 0.85 (High)  \n**Recommendation:** Investigate the PowerShell command execution, audit the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file, and analyze Chrome\/svchost.exe behavior for signs of malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal because Chrome might interact with Defender's DLLs. But then there are multiple entries of chrome.exe making network connections. A lot of network activity from a browser could be normal, but if it's excessive or to suspicious IPs, that's a red flag. However, the logs don't mention specific destinations, so maybe not enough info here.\n\nNext, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. Creating a file isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious files, that's a concern. However, the filename here is \"objeto_logico.txt\" which sounds benign. Another file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be part of normal operations if they're setting up monitoring, but creating a .yml.new file could be part of configuration changes.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is typically used to check the current user. Not suspicious on its own. The cmd.exe process runs schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks might be normal if they're malicious, but the task names here are generic like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\". Without knowing what those tasks do, it's hard to say. However, using schtasks to delete tasks could be part of cleaning up after an attack.\n\nAnother entry is schtasks.exe itself being created, which is normal. The svchost.exe interacting with the registry might be part of normal system operations, but if there's unexpected registry changes, that's a problem. However, the log just says \"Registry object added or deleted\" without specifics.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell entries, there's ProcessAccess events. If PowerShell is being used to access processes, that could be part of a script, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. The multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate some automated script running, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, there's some unusual activity like multiple network connections from Chrome, deletion of scheduled tasks, and file creations. However, without more context on the network destinations, the content of the files, or the specific registry changes, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of schtasks deletion and creation might be part of a cleanup or setup, but could also be part of an attack. The logs don't show clear signs of malware or exploitation, but the combination of these events might warrant further investigation. So, I'd say this is potentially interesting but needs more analysis to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Unusual Chrome Behavior**:\n   - **`chrome.exe` loading `taskschd.dll`**: While `taskschd.dll` is a legitimate Windows component, Chrome typically does not interact with it. This could indicate a tampered Chrome binary or malicious activity.\n   - **Frequent `chrome.exe` network connections**: Without specific destination IPs or domains, this is ambiguous, but excessive or unexplained network traffic from a browser could signal data exfiltration or C2 communication.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` deleting tasks**: The command `schtasks \/delete` is used to remove scheduled tasks. While this could be part of legitimate system cleanup, the task names (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`) are generic and could indicate the removal of malicious or benign tasks. The lack of context makes this inconclusive.\n   - **`schtasks.exe` process creation**: Normal, but the presence of both deletion and creation of tasks in the same session could suggest an attempt to modify or clean up scheduled tasks.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **`powershell.exe` file creation and registry access**: PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but repeated `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` entries could indicate script-based attacks (e.g., privilege escalation, persistence).\n   - **`whoami.exe` execution**: While benign, its use in conjunction with PowerShell might be part of a larger script to gather system information.\n\n4. **File Creation in Downloads Folder**:\n   - Files like `objeto_logico.txt` and `estrutura_ativo.txt` are named generically. If these files contain malicious payloads or are part of a data exfiltration chain, they could be concerning. However, the filenames alone are not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` suggests configuration changes for the log shipper. While this could be part of routine monitoring setup, it might also indicate an attempt to configure logging for data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n- **`svchost.exe` registry interactions**: Common for system services.\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` file creation**: Likely part of log configuration.\n- **`whoami.exe` execution**: Routine for checking user context.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate Network Traffic**:\n   - Analyze the IPs\/domains contacted by `chrome.exe` and `schtasks.exe` to rule out C2 communication.\n2. **Inspect File Contents**:\n   - Check the contents of `objeto_logico.txt`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`, and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` for hidden malicious payloads or configuration changes.\n3. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Verify the purpose of deleted\/created tasks (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, etc.) and ensure no malicious tasks remain.\n4. **Monitor PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Review PowerShell logs for signs of privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence mechanisms.\n5. **Check for Unauthorized Modifications**:\n   - Confirm that `chrome.exe` and `taskschd.dll` have not been tampered with (e.g., via hash verification).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries contain **indicators of potential compromise** (e.g., suspicious Chrome behavior, task manipulation, and PowerShell activity) but lack definitive evidence of malicious intent. Further analysis of network traffic, file contents, and system integrity is required to determine if this represents an attack or benign activity. **This warrants a moderate priority investigation.**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is schtasks.exe deleting a scheduled task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task could be part of a cleanup after an attack. Then there's a bunch of Image Load events for taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, so that might be normal.\n\nNext, there's svchost.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys. Then there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and Process Access events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so repeated access events might indicate something's up.\n\nThe command line for one cmd.exe instance is using wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's odd because why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe to remove evidence or prevent it from running. Then there's WMIC.exe loading dlls like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender, so loading that might be an attempt to bypass antivirus, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also multiple instances of deleting user accounts with net user \/del. Deleting user accounts could be part of lateral movement or removing access points. The presence of net1.exe, which seems like a typo or a renamed net.exe, might be a malicious attempt to mimic legitimate tools.\n\nPutting this all together: deleting scheduled tasks, registry modifications, using PowerShell and WMIC for process deletion and user account removal, and possible use of malicious binaries. These activities are commonly seen in post-exploitation phases of attacks. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some actions could be part of normal administrative tasks, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including deletion of scheduled tasks (schtasks.exe), registry modifications, PowerShell and WMIC process interactions, and user account deletion attempts. These patterns are commonly associated with post-exploitation activities in cyber attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user has given me a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are multiple entries involving processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and net.exe. Some of the commands stand out. For example, there's a command line that says \"cmd.exe \/c net user \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". That looks like a command to delete a user account in a domain. Another one is \"net user \"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\" \/del \/domain\" from net1.exe, which might be a typo or a malicious executable. Also, there's \"sc delete win32times\" which is deleting a service, which could be part of a cleanup after installing malware.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" events. While these are common in normal operations, the combination with the user deletion and service removal might indicate something malicious. Also, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with these commands could be part of a script or attack chain.\n\nHowever, I should check if these are normal activities. Deleting users or services could be legitimate, but the context here might be different. The presence of multiple registry modifications and process accesses might suggest that an attacker is trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a red flag, indicating a malicious binary.\n\nBut wait, there are also events with \"User Account Management\" and \"Security Group Management\" which are normal administrative tasks. However, the combination with the deletion commands and registry changes might be suspicious. The confidence here would depend on how common these activities are in normal operations. If these actions are part of a legitimate script, it's not interesting. But if they're part of a known attack pattern, like deleting users and services to cover tracks, then it's interesting.\n\nConsidering that the logs show multiple attempts to delete domain users and a service, along with registry changes and process accesses, this could be indicative of a malicious activity. The confidence is around 0.8 because while some actions are normal, the combination and repetition suggest potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated attempts to delete domain users (e.g., 'net user ... \/del \/domain'), deletion of system services (sc delete win32times), and frequent registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's deleting temporary files. The command line shows some temp files being deleted, which might be normal cleanup. But then there's another cmd.exe that's deleting a file named \"tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\" in the Temp directory. That name looks a bit odd, maybe a decoded or malicious file?\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but the repetition could indicate something automated. Also, several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate, but if they're loaded in an unusual context, it might be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's a File Created and then immediately Deleted event for a PowerShell script in the Temp folder. That could be an attempt to execute a script temporarily and then clean it up. The deletion might be to avoid leaving traces. Also, the presence of multiple Process Access events for powershell.exe might indicate that the process is being manipulated or monitored.\n\nThe command line for the first cmd.exe includes deleting files with paths like %temp%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt. The use of variables and the names of the files might be part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the combination of file deletions, multiple PowerShell activities, and registry changes could be indicative of a script or malware trying to persist or execute.\n\nAnother point is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events. If PowerShell is being used to run scripts that are then deleted, that might be a tactic to avoid detection. Also, the fact that the same file is created and deleted might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack here. The events are mostly about process creation, file deletion, and registry changes. Without seeing actual malicious payloads or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. But the suspicious file names and the cleanup activities do raise some flags.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch might be interesting because of the suspicious file operations and the use of PowerShell in a way that's typical for malicious activities. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because some of these events could be benign. But the combination of multiple indicators points towards a potential issue that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**\n1. **File Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process deletes files like `unidade_temporario_calc.txt` and `tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe` in the user's `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. The file names (`calc_decoded.exe`) suggest potential obfuscation or decoding of malicious payloads (e.g., \"calc\" is a common placeholder for payloads in malware).\n\n2. **PowerShell Script Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. This pattern is common in malware to avoid leaving traces on the system.\n\n3. **Unusual .NET DLL Loads**:\n   - Multiple `Image Load` events for .NET DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`) are logged. While these are legitimate, their repeated loading in a short timeframe could indicate PowerShell being used to execute .NET-based payloads or obfuscated scripts.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - The `Registry Value Set` event for `powershell.exe` could indicate attempts to modify execution policies or registry keys related to PowerShell, which is a common tactic in malware to bypass restrictions.\n\n5. **Repetitive \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks may indicate automated or scripted operations, potentially tied to lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting**\n- The combination of **file creation\/deletion**, **PowerShell activity**, and **registry changes** suggests an attacker may be attempting to:\n  - Execute a script temporarily (to avoid detection).\n  - Clean up artifacts (e.g., `calc_decoded.exe`).\n  - Use PowerShell for malicious purposes (e.g., payload execution, persistence).\n\n- The file names and Temp directory usage are red flags commonly associated with malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Check for Remaining Artifacts**:\n   - Verify if the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.opf.ps1`) or `calc_decoded.exe` still exists in the Temp directory or in memory.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Logs**:\n   - Review PowerShell transcripts, event logs (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell\/Operational`), or use tools like `Get-Command` to check for suspicious modules or scripts.\n\n3. **Correlate with Network Activity**:\n   - Look for outbound connections or unusual DNS queries from the system during the timeframe of these events.\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Inspect registry keys (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`) for new entries or scheduled tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**This batch is suspicious and merits further investigation.** The combination of file cleanup, PowerShell activity, and registry changes aligns with tactics used by malware to execute payloads and avoid detection. However, without additional context (e.g., network traffic, process tree, or memory dumps), it is not possible to confirm malicious intent definitively. **Confidence level: Medium (60-70%)**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these logs together and determine if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's common, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. Let me check the specific tasks. There's a \"Pipe Created\" event, which might be normal, but sometimes pipes are used for communication between processes, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there's an \"Image loaded\" event pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate because it's part of the antivirus software. But I should note that. Then a \"File created\" event in the user's AppData folder. Creating files there isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe.\n\nThere are multiple \"Registry value set\" events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag. But some of these are from svchost.exe or other system processes, which might be normal. However, the repetition might indicate something.\n\nThen there are several \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell. If a process is being accessed multiple times, that could be normal, but combined with other events, maybe not. Also, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being run. Whoami is a standard tool to get user info, but if it's run many times, maybe it's part of a script or being used to check permissions.\n\nAnother thing is the \"File created\" event for winlogbeat. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a new config file might be part of a legitimate setup. However, if the user didn't initiate that, it could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the \"Image loaded\" for urlmon.dll in both calc.exe and Calculator.exe. Urlmon is part of Internet Explorer, so that's normal for some applications. But if it's loaded in unexpected contexts, maybe not. However, the names here are calc.exe and Calculator.exe, which are standard, so that might be okay.\n\nNow, putting it all together: multiple PowerShell events, some registry changes, a few file creations. The presence of multiple \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell could indicate that someone is trying to manipulate or monitor the process. The registry events might be part of setting up persistence. The whoami.exe runs could be checking user context. However, there's no clear evidence of a direct attack, like downloading malicious files or connecting to external IPs. The events seem to be a mix of normal system activities and potential suspicious behavior. But without more context, like network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the repetition of certain events and the use of PowerShell might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events with 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' tasks, combined with file creation in user directories and repeated execution of whoami.exe, suggest potential lateral movement or persistence attempts.

Then whoami.exe was executed, which is a standard command to check user identity. That's usual.\n\nAnother powershell.exe process access. Still not alarming. Then ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe setting registry values. Those are typical Windows processes.

Multiple entries here, but unless there's something unusual in the queries or connections, like to malicious domains, it's normal.\n\nLooking at all together, most events are related to standard processes and normal activities. No signs of malware, no unusual file paths, no unexpected network behavior. The only thing that stands out is the winlogbeat file creation, but that's part of the tool's setup.
