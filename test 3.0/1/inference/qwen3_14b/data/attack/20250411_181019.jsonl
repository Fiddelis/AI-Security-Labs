{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the processes mentioned. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' activities. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. Then there's 'sc.exe' creating a service called 'win32times' with a binPath that points to a script on a non-existing path: 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and later 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The fact that the script paths don't exist might indicate that the attacker is trying to create a service that runs a non-existent script, which could be a way to hide malicious activity or set up a backdoor.\n\nLooking at the command line for 'cmd.exe', there's a line that uses 'sc create' to set up the service. The use of 'sc' to create a service is suspicious, especially when combined with the non-existent file paths. Also, the 'sc qc win32times' command is used to query the service configuration, which might be checking if the service was created successfully.\n\nThere are multiple entries for 'Registry value set' events. While registry changes can be normal, the combination with the service creation and the non-existent files might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or inject malicious code.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' are normal, as that's a legitimate Windows DLL. However, if there were other suspicious DLLs, that would be a concern. But in this case, it's just the standard one.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file is probably part of the logging software, so that's likely benign. The rest of the entries are for common processes like 'notepad.exe', 'calc.exe', and others, which don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious points are the service creation with non-existent scripts and the frequent use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for process creation and registry modifications. These could be signs of an attacker trying to establish persistence on the system. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, just the attempts. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible that some of these actions are part of legitimate administrative tasks, but the combination of events does point towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Use of 'sc.exe' to create a service with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), suggesting potential persistence mechanism attempts. 2) Repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe process creations with registry modification events, which are common in post-exploitation activities. 3) Unusual service name 'win32times' with suspicious command-line parameters.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through the events to spot any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. Then there's the use of scvhost.exe and other system processes, which might be normal, but combined with other activities could be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's an entry where cmd.exe is used with the scvhost.exe, which might be a typo for svchost.exe. But the user wrote \"scvhost.exe\" – maybe that's a mistake, but I should note it. Also, there's a mention of creating a file in the Downloads directory, which isn't necessarily bad, but the filename is .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a legitimate setup, but could also be a sign of someone trying to install something.\n\nThen, looking at the image loaded events, there's urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. These are legitimate system files, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a problem. Also, the chrome.exe entries loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll (which is related to Windows Defender) might be normal, but if there's a lot of these events, it could indicate something's going on.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated registry value set events for chrome.exe. That might be normal, but if combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger attack. Also, the presence of RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe might be benign, but if they're doing unexpected things, that's a concern.\n\nWait, there's an entry where a file is created in the Downloads folder by winlogbeat.exe. That's part of the setup process for winlogbeat, but if that's unexpected, it could be a sign of compromise. Also, the multiple registry events for chrome.exe might indicate some kind of configuration changes or attempts to modify the registry.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell and cmd.exe usage, along with the creation of files and registry modifications, could indicate either normal system activity or a potential security threat. Since there's no clear malicious payload or obvious attack pattern, but the frequency and types of events are a bit suspicious, I'd lean towards classifying this as interesting for further investigation. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the combination of events might warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High-Frequency PowerShell and CMD Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries for `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` (e.g., `scvhost.exe`—likely a typo for `svchost.exe`) are logged. While these processes are common in legitimate scenarios, their frequent use in conjunction with registry modifications or file operations could indicate script-based attacks or lateral movement.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation:**\n   - A file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is created in the `Downloads` directory by `winlogbeat.exe`. While Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper, the absence of context (e.g., user interaction, installation logs) raises questions about its purpose here.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - `chrome.exe` loads `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components). While these are legitimate, repeated image loads could indicate evasion techniques (e.g., bypassing AMSI detection) or unintended behavior.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Numerous `Registry value set` events for `chrome.exe` and other processes. This could reflect benign configuration changes, but in the absence of clear context, it might hint at attempts to alter system behavior or inject malicious configurations.\n\n5. **System Process Involvement:**\n   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `Calculator.exe` are involved in registry and image load events. While these are typically legitimate, their association with suspicious activities (e.g., `scvhost.exe` typo) could signal process hijacking or impersonation.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The logs do not conclusively point to a breach but contain **anomalies** (e.g., repeated registry changes, file creation by Winlogbeat without context) that could indicate either:\n  - **Legitimate activity** (e.g., system updates, log setup).\n  - **Early-stage compromise** (e.g., post-exploitation activity, persistence mechanisms).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for additional context (e.g., user accounts, network traffic, process tree) to determine if these events are part of a larger attack chain.\n\n2. **Investigate Winlogbeat File:**\n   - Verify the legitimacy of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` and ensure it was intentionally created (e.g., by a user or as part of a documented setup).\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell\/CMD Usage:**\n   - Use tools like [PowerShell Transcripting](https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/powershell\/module\/microsoft.powershell.host\/start-transcript) or SIEM alerts to detect anomalous scripts.\n\n4. **Analyze AMSI Bypass:**\n   - Investigate if `amsi.dll` loading by `chrome.exe` is part of a known evasion technique (e.g., bypassing antivirus\/EDR tools).\n\n5. **Check for Process Anomalies:**\n   - Validate the legitimacy of `scvhost.exe` (likely `svchost.exe`) and ensure no malicious binaries are masquerading as system processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile no immediate malicious activity is confirmed, the combination of **frequent registry changes, unusual file creation, and system process involvement** suggests **further investigation is warranted**. This could be a false positive, but the patterns align with early-stage compromise or misconfigured systems."}
