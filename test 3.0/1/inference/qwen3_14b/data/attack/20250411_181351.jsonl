{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting. So, first, looking at the events. There's a lot of PowerShell activity. That's common, but sometimes it can be a red flag. Let me check the specific commands.\n\nOne of the processes has a command line that's taking a screenshot and saving it to the TEMP directory. The code uses Add-Type to load System.Windows.Forms, then copies the screen and saves a PNG. That's unusual. Why would someone take screenshots via PowerShell? Maybe for legitimate reasons, but combined with other events, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of ProcessAccess and Registry value set events for PowerShell. Also, ImageLoad events pointing to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for PowerShell, but when combined with the screenshot code, it's possible that this is part of a larger malicious activity. For example, taking screenshots could be part of data exfiltration or reconnaissance.\n\nBut wait, the screenshots are saved in the TEMP directory. Maybe the user is just using PowerShell for some legitimate task. However, the repetition of the same command line multiple times with different filenames might indicate automation or repeated attempts. Also, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might suggest that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not standard, perhaps loading additional modules or executing scripts that aren't normally part of the system.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the whoami.exe command is used, which is a legitimate tool to check user context, but if that's part of a sequence of commands that are part of a larger attack, it could be a sign of privilege escalation or checking user rights.\n\nThe classification should be INTERESTING because the combination of PowerShell being used to take screenshots, multiple registry and process access events, and loading various .NET assemblies could indicate a potential security threat. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like network connections or file modifications, the confidence might be around 0.7. It's not conclusive, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands to capture screenshots using System.Windows.Forms and saving them to the TEMP directory, which is unusual and could indicate reconnaissance or data exfiltration.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The answer has to be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events to see what's going on. There are several entries with \"powershell.exe\" in the process name. The command lines for some of them involve using PowerShell to capture screenshots. For example, the command_line includes Add-Type for System.Windows.Forms, then creating a bitmap and saving it to the TEMP directory with names like \"estrutura_ativo.png\", \"modulo_principal.png\", etc. That seems suspicious because capturing screenshots could be part of reconnaissance, like taking screenshots of sensitive information or the user's desktop.\n\nThen there are events about files being created and deleted in the Temp directory. One file is created and then immediately deleted, which might be a sign of temporary files used during an attack. Also, there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData, which could indicate changes to the startup configuration, possibly for persistence.\n\nOther events include registry value changes and pipe creation. Multiple processes like conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe have registry events. However, the majority of the events are related to PowerShell activities. The fact that there are multiple screenshot captures saved to the TEMP directory might indicate that an attacker is trying to gather information from the system. \n\nBut wait, could this be a legitimate activity? Maybe a user is running a script that takes screenshots for some purpose. However, the repetition of similar commands and the number of times the screenshot is saved might be more indicative of automated or malicious behavior. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes and file operations might suggest an attempt to modify system settings or install persistence mechanisms.\n\nOn the other hand, some events are normal, like the creation of a .yml.new file by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be part of legitimate monitoring. But the combination of multiple PowerShell screenshot commands, file creation\/deletion, and registry changes raises a red flag. \n\nI need to check if there's any indication of malware or unauthorized access. The screenshots could be part of a data exfiltration attempt. Also, the fact that the same command is used multiple times with different filenames might be an attempt to capture multiple screens or evade detection by varying the filenames.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But based on the logs provided, the repeated PowerShell activities involving screenshot capture, along with file and registry changes, are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events is **INTERESTING** for investigation. Here's the rationale:\n\n### Key Suspicious Activity:\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Screenshot Commands**:\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing scripts that use `System.Windows.Forms` to capture screenshots (`bitmap.Save` to the TEMP directory with filenames like `estrutura_ativo.png`, `modulo_principal.png`, etc.). This could indicate **reconnaissance** (e.g., capturing sensitive UI elements or system state) or **data exfiltration** (e.g., stealing screenshots of confidential data).\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - A file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in the PowerShell directory, and another (`elemento_base.png`) is saved to TEMP. The immediate deletion of files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) and use of temporary storage may suggest **ephemeral malware behavior** or attempts to avoid leaving persistent traces.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple processes (including `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, etc.) trigger \"Registry value set\" events. This could indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup keys) or **malicious configuration changes**.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Activity**:\n   - While some events (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file) appear legitimate, the **high volume of PowerShell-related events** (screenshot capture, file operations, registry changes) suggests **potential exploitation** or **script-based attacks**.\n\n### Confidence:\n- **High**. The combination of repeated screenshot capture, file\/registry tampering, and PowerShell misuse (common in attacks) strongly indicates **malicious activity** warranting further analysis (e.g., checking for exfiltration of screenshot files, inspecting registry changes for persistence, or correlating with network traffic).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs contain **clear indicators of compromise (IoCs)** and merit immediate investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting. All the events are related to Chrome.exe. The first few entries are about registry values being set. That's normal for Chrome, maybe updating settings. Then there's a DNS query, which is common for browsing. But wait, there's an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender files. Why would Chrome load those? That might be suspicious because Chrome shouldn't need to load Defender's DLLs. Could be a sign of malicious activity, like trying to bypass security features. But I should check if this is normal behavior. Maybe it's a false positive. However, multiple registry changes and loading Defender files could indicate something's wrong. The confidence isn't 100% because it's not definitive, but it's enough to flag for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing registry modifications and loading Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which may indicate evasion techniques or malicious activity attempting to interact with security mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
