{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate tool, so maybe just a normal operation. Then there's mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE changing registry values. Those could be normal too, but I should check for any suspicious changes.\n\nNext, there's a lot of powershell.exe processes. The command line shows it's being run normally, but then there are image loads of various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are part of .NET, so that's expected if PowerShell is running scripts. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be normal, but I need to see if there's anything unusual.\n\nThen there's a file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest...dfy.ps1, followed by its deletion. That could be part of a script execution, but temporary files are common. However, the fact that it's created and then deleted might be a red flag if it's part of an attack. Also, there's a file named teste.ps1 created in Downloads, which is executed with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass. Bypassing execution policies can be a sign of malicious activity, as it allows scripts to run without restrictions.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events might just be normal PowerShell operations, but the combination of creating and deleting temporary files, along with executing a script with bypassed policies, is suspicious. The user is running a script that could potentially be malicious, especially if the script is from an untrusted source. The use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass could indicate an attempt to run a script that would otherwise be blocked by default policies.\n\nAlso, the same file .winlogbeat.yml.new is created twice by winlogbeat.exe, which might be part of configuration changes, but if it's being modified frequently, that could be a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the execution of a PowerShell script with bypassed execution policy and the creation\/deletion of a temporary script file. These are indicators that could be part of an attack. However, since the user is running a script from their own Downloads folder, it's possible that it's a legitimate script. But the combination of these events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, creation\/deletion of temporary script files in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp, and loading of potentially suspicious DLLs (e.g., MpOAV.dll) suggest potential malicious activity or script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": \"Medium\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell.exe is accessing a process, which is normal. Then there are several ImageLoad events. The files loaded are all related to .NET Framework components like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably just PowerShell running normally. But wait, there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That seems suspicious. Why would a script be created and then immediately deleted? That could be a sign of an attacker trying to execute a script without leaving evidence.\n\nThen there's another FileCreate event for a StartupProfileData file. That might be part of PowerShell's normal operation, but combined with the other events, it's worth noting. The last event is a Remote Command execution, but the process is null here. That might be an issue with the log or maybe a different process, but it's not clear.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events involve legitimate .NET files, but the creation and deletion of a temporary script could indicate malicious activity. Attackers often use temp files to execute scripts. Also, the Remote Command event adds to the suspicion. However, since some of these are normal operations, it's not a clear-cut case. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.65. It's interesting enough to warrant further investigation but not definitive proof of a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes loading legitimate .NET DLLs (normal behavior) but also creating\/deleting a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1) in the user's Temp directory, which could indicate script execution attempts.
