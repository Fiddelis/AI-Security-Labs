{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a process called MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.54.exe creating a file named setup.exe in the EdgeUpdate directory. Then, the same process changes the file's creation time. That might be normal during an update, but sometimes attackers mimic legitimate processes. However, I need to check more.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files part of Windows Defender. Loading them isn't suspicious on its own. Then there's a Pipe Created event for setup.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple \"User Account Management\" events. A lot of them might indicate something like a script or process interacting with user accounts, but since they're all the same task, maybe it's just normal activity. However, the repetition could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command that checks for INF files with specific patterns. The command is looking for sections like [defaultinstall.nt...], which might relate to device installation or driver updates. This could be part of a legitimate system check, but if it's done in an unusual context, it might be suspicious. However, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which might limit script execution, so maybe that's a safeguard.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal during setup. However, the presence of a .new file might indicate a temporary file being written, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThere's also a Chrome.exe DNS query, which is normal. The svchost.exe processes are doing registry value sets, which can be part of normal service operations. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is also legitimate, as urlmon is part of Internet Explorer and used for URL monikers.\n\nPutting it all together: most of the events seem to be related to normal system operations like updates, Defender processes, and legitimate applications. The setup.exe file creation and modification could be part of an update process. The PowerShell script might be checking for INF files, which could be part of a system check or an attempt to find installable drivers. However, without more context like unusual network activity, unexpected processes, or access to sensitive files, the logs don't show clear signs of malicious behavior. The repetition of User Account Management events might be a minor concern, but not enough to flag as malicious. So, the batch doesn't seem to be interesting for investigation unless there's more context I'm missing.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate clear evidence of malicious activity or security incidents. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** The creation and modification of `setup.exe` in the `EdgeUpdate` directory align with typical update operations. File creation time changes are common during installation or patching.\n   - **Defender-Related Activity:** `CompatTelRunner.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) is normal and expected for real-time protection and threat detection.\n\n2. **Neutral or Benign Events:**\n   - **Pipe Creation:** The `setup.exe` pipe creation event is a standard inter-process communication mechanism and not inherently suspicious.\n   - **PowerShell Script:** The script checks for INF files containing specific patterns (e.g., `[defaultinstall.nt...]`), which may relate to driver installation or system configuration. The `Restricted` execution policy suggests it is not executing arbitrary scripts, reducing risk.\n   - **Winlogbeat File Creation:** The `.yml.new` file creation is consistent with configuration setup for the log shipping tool `winlogbeat`.\n\n3. **Repetitive but Normal Events:**\n   - **User Account Management Logs:** Multiple entries with the same task are likely from automated processes (e.g., system policies or background services) and do not indicate compromise.\n   - **svchost.exe and Registry Activity:** These processes manage Windows services and registry updates, which are routine for system stability and configuration.\n\n4. **No Clear Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - No unexpected processes, unusual network activity, or access to sensitive files (e.g., credentials, system binaries) are noted.\n   - No signs of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries reflect **normal system behavior** related to updates, security tools, and configuration management. While the repetition of \"User Account Management\" events might warrant further scrutiny in a different context, **there is no compelling evidence to flag this batch for investigation**. \n\n**Recommendation:** No immediate action is required. Monitor for anomalies in system updates or PowerShell scripts if the environment is known to have sensitive operations."}

That's normal, maybe part of updates or user activity. Not a red flag yet.\n\nNext, MsMpEng.exe (Windows Defender) loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate system file, but sometimes malware mimics legitimate processes. However, since it's Defender, maybe it's just doing its job. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating config files is normal. The path is in the Downloads folder, which might be okay if it's user-initiated.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again. This is part of the Compatibility Telemetry, which is a Microsoft service. So that's probably legitimate.\n\nSeveral svchost.exe entries creating files in Delivery Optimization folders. That's part of Windows Update, so normal activity. The files are cache and state files, which are typical.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an Edge installer file. That's expected during an update. Then deleting a temporary file, which is standard cleanup.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe (Windows Defender) loading various DLLs and creating lock files. All these are part of Defender's normal operations. The paths are in ProgramData and Windows Temp, which are common for system processes.\n\nThere's a conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is part of the console host, and mintty is a terminal emulator. Both are legitimate, maybe user activity or scripts.\n\nThen a process with null name and task None. That might be an error or a log entry that didn't capture the process correctly. Not sure, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe git.exe entries creating files in a project directory.

All of them are from the git.exe process, and each one is a file creation event under the semver\\functions directory in a node_modules folder. The files being created are all JavaScript files, like compare.js, diff.js, eq.js, etc. \n\nHmm, semver is a package used for versioning in Node.js projects. The functions directory likely contains utility functions for version comparison. Since all the files are part of the semver package, and they're being created by git.exe, maybe this is part of a normal Git operation, like cloning a repository or pulling changes. \n\nBut wait, why are all these files being created? Typically, when you install a Node.js package, npm or yarn would handle the installation, and the files would be part of the package. However, git.exe creating these files might be unusual. However, if the user is using Git to manage a project that includes Node.js modules, it's possible that the semver package is part of the project's dependencies. \n\nBut I should check if there's any suspicious activity here. Are there any signs of malicious behavior? The files are all legitimate JavaScript files related to versioning. The paths are within the node_modules directory, which is standard for npm packages. The process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool. \n\nHowever, the fact that all these files are being created in a short period might be normal if the user is initializing a new project or pulling down a large repository. Alternatively, if the user hasn't installed the semver package yet, maybe Git is somehow involved in creating these files, which is not typical. But I think more likely, this is part of a normal Git operation where the semver package is part of the repository's structure. \n\nI don't see any signs of malware or unexpected activity. The files are all standard and part of a legitimate package. So, this might just be a normal process of Git interacting with a Node.js project's dependencies. Therefore, the events are likely benign and not indicative of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Events:**\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `git.exe` process is creating multiple JavaScript files within the `semver\\functions` directory of a Node.js project's `node_modules` folder. These files (e.g., `compare.js`, `parse.js`, `satisfies.js`) are standard utility functions from the [semver](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/semver) package, which is commonly used for semantic versioning in Node.js projects.\n\n---\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Legitimate Process and Files:**\n   - **`git.exe`**: A trusted tool for version control, often used to manage code repositories.\n   - **`semver`**: A widely-used npm package for parsing and comparing semantic version numbers. The files being created are standard components of this package.\n\n2. **Contextual Behavior:**\n   - The files are created in the `node_modules` directory, which is typical for npm\/yarn-managed projects. This suggests the activity is part of a normal project setup or dependency management workflow.\n   - The volume of file creations (20+ files) could indicate a fresh installation of the `semver` package or a clone of a repository containing this package.\n\n3. **No Red Flags:**\n   - **No unusual file names or extensions** (all `.js` files).\n   - **No signs of malware or unauthorized activity** (e.g., no suspicious process names, unexpected paths, or network activity).\n   - **No errors or warnings** in the logs, which might be expected if malicious activity were occurring.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events are **likely benign** and part of a normal Git\/npm workflow. The `git.exe` process is creating standard files from the `semver` package as part of a project setup or dependency resolution. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in the logs.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo further action is required unless additional logs or context (e.g., unexpected network activity, unauthorized user access) suggest otherwise."}

So, all the events are about files being created under the semver directory in node_modules. The process involved is git.exe. Hmm, semver is a package for parsing and comparing semantic versioning, which is common in npm packages. \n\nNow, git.exe creating files in node_modules... Well, normally, when you run git commands, it might clone repositories or manage version control, but creating files in node_modules sounds odd. Typically, node_modules are managed by npm, not git. Maybe the user is using git to clone a repository that includes node_modules, but that's not standard. \n\nWait, but looking at the paths, it's under a specific directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software. This seems like a student's project folder, possibly part of a course. The files being created are standard for a semver package, like index.js, package.json, internal files, etc. \n\nSo, if the user is working on a project that requires semver, maybe they installed it via npm, which would normally place it in node_modules. But why is git.exe creating these files? Maybe they're using git to manage the project, and during a clone or checkout, git is creating the files. However, git doesn't typically create the internal structure of node_modules; that's usually handled by npm. \n\nAlternatively, could this be a malicious activity? If git.exe is creating files in node_modules, maybe an attacker is trying to inject malicious code. But the files listed here are all standard for a semver package. Unless there's a file that doesn't belong, but looking at the list, they all seem legitimate. \n\nAnother angle: the user might be using a Git hook or a script that's part of the project, which triggers file creation. But again, that's a stretch. More likely, this is a normal activity if the user is setting up their environment. However, the fact that git.exe is creating these files is unusual. Normally, npm would handle installing packages into node_modules. \n\nWait, maybe the user cloned a repository that has a submodule or something, and git is initializing submodules, which might create files. But even then, the semver package is a dependency, not a submodule. \n\nConsidering all this, the logs might just be part of a normal setup, but the involvement of git.exe in creating node_modules files is suspicious.

So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that files were created in the node_modules\\sshpk directory by git.exe. The files are various JavaScript files and some man pages. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Git is a version control system, and when you install packages using npm (Node Package Manager), it often extracts package contents into node_modules. The sshpk package is a Node.js library for handling SSH keys. So, creating these files as part of an npm install makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the events are all FileCreate entries. Normally, during an npm install, files are extracted, which would generate a lot of file creation events. However, the key here is whether these events are part of a legitimate installation or if they're indicative of something malicious. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be within the expected structure of a Node.js module. The presence of lib directories with .js files and man pages for command-line tools is typical for such packages. The process is git.exe, which is used for version control, but git itself doesn't typically create files in node_modules. That's usually done by npm or yarn. \n\nHmm, that's a point to consider. If git.exe is creating files in node_modules, that might be unusual. Normally, git would be cloning repositories, not installing npm packages. Maybe the user ran a git command that somehow triggered npm install, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the files were created by another process, but the logs attribute them to git.exe. \n\nWait, but the winlog task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". If the rule is set to trigger on file creation, then each file being added would generate an event. If the user is just installing a package, this could result in many such events. However, if the same process (git.exe) is creating multiple files in a node_modules directory, that might be a red flag. \n\nBut then again, maybe the user is using a git hook or some script that runs npm install as part of the git process. That's possible, though not common. Alternatively, if the user is on a system where git is being used in a way that's not standard, but without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother angle: the sshpk package itself. If this is a legitimate package that the user is installing, then these files are expected. But if sshpk is not a known package or if there's a typo in the name, that could be a sign of a malicious package. However, sshpk is a real package used for SSH key handling. \n\nConsidering all this, the events could be part of a normal npm install process, even if git.exe is the process logged. However, the fact that git.exe is creating files in node_modules might be a misattribution. Maybe the actual process is npm.exe, but the logs are incorrectly labeling it as git.exe. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is using a tool that integrates git and npm, such as some CI\/CD pipelines or custom scripts, this could be normal. But in a typical development environment, this seems a bit off. \n\nHowever, without additional information like error messages, unusual file contents, or other suspicious activities, it's challenging to confirm malicious intent. The sheer number of file creation events might be normal for an install, but the process being git.exe is suspicious. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that while the events could be part of a legitimate installation, the involvement of git.exe in creating node_modules files is unusual and might warrant further investigation to ensure that the process is correctly attributed and that no malicious activity is occurring.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events logged here involve the creation of multiple files within the `node_modules\\sshpk` directory by **git.exe**. While the file paths and structure align with a typical Node.js module (e.g., `lib\/*.js`, `man\/` pages), the **process responsible** (`git.exe`) raises questions about the legitimacy of the activity. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **File Structure**:\n   - The files created (e.g., `lib\/*.js`, `man1\/sshpk-conv.1`) are consistent with a legitimate Node.js package (`sshpk`), which is a real library for handling SSH keys.\n   - The presence of `man\/` pages suggests the package includes command-line tools, which is standard for some modules.\n\n2. **Process Involved (`git.exe`)**:\n   - **Git** is a version control tool and does **not** typically install or manage Node.js modules. This is usually handled by **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm**.\n   - The attribution of file creation to **git.exe** is **unusual** and may indicate a misattribution (e.g., logs incorrectly labeling the process) or a non-standard workflow (e.g., a custom script or tool that integrates Git with package management).\n\n3. **Volume of Events**:\n   - The large number of file creation events (e.g., 20+ entries) is **expected during an npm install**, but only if the process responsible is a package manager, **not Git**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n- **Legitimate Scenario**:\n  - The user may be running a **custom script** or **CI\/CD pipeline** that uses Git to trigger an `npm install` (e.g., via Git hooks or automation tools).\n  - The logs may have a **misattribution** (e.g., incorrect process name in the log metadata).\n\n- **Suspicious Scenario**:\n  - If **git.exe** is indeed the process creating these files, it could indicate **malicious activity**, such as:\n    - A **malware** or **trojan** masquerading as Git to install harmful packages.\n    - A **compromised system** where Git is being exploited to inject malicious code into `node_modules`.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Attribution**:\n   - Check the **actual process** responsible for the file creation (e.g., via process monitoring tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals**).\n   - Confirm whether the logs correctly label the process (e.g., `npm.exe` instead of `git.exe`).\n\n2. **Inspect the `sshpk` Package**:\n   - Ensure the `sshpk` package is **trusted** (check its origin on [npmjs.com](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/sshpk)).\n   - Scan the package for **malicious code** using tools like **npm audit** or **vulnerability scanners**.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Look for **unusual behavior** (e.g., unexpected network activity, unauthorized file modifications) during or after the installation.\n   - Use **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to detect suspicious process interactions.\n\n4. **Audit System Logs**:\n   - Review system logs for **other suspicious events** (e.g., unauthorized access, unexpected process execution).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the file structure and package (`sshpk`) are consistent with a legitimate Node.js module, the **involvement of `git.exe`** in creating these files is **atypical** and warrants further investigation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. All the events are about files being created by git.exe in the node_modules directory. The files are typical ones you'd see in a npm package, like package.json, index.js, license, readme.md, etc. The paths are all under a user's Downloads folder, specifically in a project directory called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". \n\nHmm, so git.exe is creating these files. That makes me think of a normal git operation, like cloning a repository or pulling changes. When you do that, git would create the necessary files in the node_modules folder as part of installing dependencies. The fact that multiple packages are being created (sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, etc.) suggests that this is part of a standard npm install process, which is common when setting up a project.\n\nI don't see any unusual activity here. The process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool. The files being created are standard for npm packages. There's no indication of malware or suspicious behavior. The user might be working on a software project and just installed dependencies, which is a normal action. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility of this being malicious. For example, if git.exe was being used to download and execute malicious code, but in this case, the logs only show file creation, not execution. Also, the paths are all within the user's Downloads directory, which is a common place for legitimate projects. \n\nSince all the events are part of a typical git\/npm workflow, I don't see anything that's out of the ordinary. The classification here would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no evidence of malicious activity.

The user provided a bunch of JSON events, all related to files being created by git.exe in the node_modules directory. The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The files are being created in the node_modules folder, which is typical for npm packages. The process is git.exe, which is a normal part of version control. The events mention files like index.js, package.json, license, etc., which are standard files in npm packages.\n\nNow, considering security aspects. Malicious activity often involves unexpected file creation, especially in directories that shouldn't be modified, or by processes that aren't supposed to create files. However, git.exe is a legitimate process, and creating files in node_modules during a git operation (like cloning or pulling) is normal. The files listed are common in npm packages, so this seems like part of a normal software installation or dependency management.\n\nBut wait, could there be a scenario where this is malicious? Maybe if the user didn't initiate the git operation, or if the files are being created in an unusual location. However, the path here is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\... which looks like a typical user download directory. The presence of multiple node_modules folders suggests that this is part of a project setup, which is normal.\n\nAnother angle: are there any anomalies in the events? All events are FileCreate with git.exe, no errors or unusual processes. No signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized access. The files are standard, so no red flags there.\n\nConfidence-wise, since all the activities align with normal git and npm operations, it's likely not interesting. However, there's a slight possibility that if the user didn't expect these files to be created, but given the context, it's more likely legitimate. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent standard file creation operations by git.exe during package installation in a typical node_modules directory structure.

My job is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Git.exe is typically part of Git for Windows, used for version control. The files being created are in the node_modules folder, which is common in JavaScript projects managed by npm. The tcomb library is a TypeScript type checking library. So, these files are likely part of a normal npm install process when setting up a project.\n\nLooking at the events, they all have the same process name, git.exe, and the task is File created. The paths are all under the same directory structure, which suggests that this is part of a single operation, like cloning a repository or pulling changes. Since git.exe is a legitimate process, and the files are standard library files, there's no obvious sign of malicious activity here.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any unusual pattern. For example, if these files were created by an unexpected process, or if there were multiple processes involved, that might be a red flag. But in this case, all events are from git.exe, which is expected during a git operation. The fact that multiple files are created in a structured manner under node_modules is typical when installing dependencies.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Are there any other suspicious activities in the batch? The user mentioned that the entire batch should be considered as a whole. Since all events are related to a normal git operation and the files are part of a legitimate library, there's no indication of malware or unauthorized access. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say it's pretty high that this is not interesting.

So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that git.exe created various files in the node_modules\\tcomb\\lib directory. The files are things like dict.js, enums.js, extend.js, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Git is typically used for version control, and when you clone a repository or pull changes, it might create files as part of the process. However, the node_modules directory is usually where npm packages are installed. If someone is using git to manage a project that includes node_modules, maybe they're tracking those files, which isn't common practice. Usually, node_modules are excluded in .gitignore files.\n\nBut wait, looking at the paths, all the files are under node_modules\\tcomb\\lib. Tcomb is a JavaScript library, so those files are part of the package. If the user is cloning a repository that includes node_modules, git would create those files. However, it's more likely that the user is running npm install, which would create node_modules, but git isn't responsible for that. Unless they're using git to track those files, which is unusual.\n\nAnother angle: Are there any signs of malicious activity? The process is git.exe, which is a legitimate process. The files being created are standard JavaScript files. There's no mention of any suspicious processes or unexpected network activity. The fact that multiple files are created in a structured way (like lib directory) suggests it's part of a package installation rather than malware.\n\nBut why are these events being logged? The FileCreate rule might be triggered by the system's monitoring. If the user is working on a project that involves these files, it's normal. However, if the user isn't expecting git to create files in node_modules, that could be a red flag. But without additional context, like other suspicious activities or unauthorized access, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch of events shows git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which could be part of a normal git operation if the repository includes those files. However, since node_modules are typically managed by npm and not tracked by git, this might be unusual. But without more evidence of malicious behavior, it's not definitively suspicious.

If the user is using git to clone a repository that includes node_modules, then git might be pulling down these files as part of the repository. However, typically, node_modules are not tracked by git because they're generated via npm or yarn. But sometimes, if someone commits them, git would handle them. However, that's not standard practice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is running git in a directory where node_modules is present, and git is creating these files as part of some operation. But the event is \"File created,\" which could be part of a normal git operation, like checking out files. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in a specific directory might be a red flag. But considering the process is git.exe and the files are part of a known library, it's more likely legitimate.\n\nAnother angle: are there any signs of malicious activity? The files are all .js and .d.ts files, which are standard for JavaScript and TypeScript. No unusual file extensions or names. The process is git.exe, which is a trusted executable. No other processes or suspicious activities mentioned in the logs.\n\nSo, putting this all together: these events are likely part of a normal git operation where files in node_modules are being created.
