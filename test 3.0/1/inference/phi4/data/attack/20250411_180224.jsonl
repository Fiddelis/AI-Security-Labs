The use of 'powershell.exe' with '-ep bypass', which disables script execution policies, is a common tactic in PowerShell attacks to execute arbitrary scripts. Additionally, the creation and querying of scheduled tasks ('schtasks.exe') targeting non-existing scripts suggest attempts to persist or schedule future activities. Frequent registry value modifications by various processes like 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe', along with file creations, further hint at potential unauthorized configuration changes or data exfiltration. The combination of these indicators across different processes suggests a coordinated attempt to compromise the system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
