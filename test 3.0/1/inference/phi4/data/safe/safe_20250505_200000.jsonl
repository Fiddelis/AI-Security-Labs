{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200000.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'svchost.exe' processes performing registry modifications and file creation, combined with unusual logon events and repeated actions from non-standard processes like DrvInst.exe and SDXHelper.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **DrvInst.exe Behavior**: The repetitive registry setting by `DrvInst.exe` is suspicious as it suggests potential persistence or configuration changes often seen in malware.\n\n2. **svchost.exe Activity**: \n   - Frequent registry modifications and file creation events are common indicators of malicious activity, especially when originating from a process that can be easily impersonated like `svchost.exe`.\n   \n3. **Unusual Logons**: \n   - Presence of special logon and logon events potentially without proper credentials or unexpected user accounts may indicate unauthorized access attempts.\n\n4. **SDXHelper.exe Actions**:\n   - The repeated image loading of system DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `combase.dll`) by an unusual process like `SDXHelper.exe` is indicative of potential code injection or exploitation activity.\n\n5. **File Creation Patterns**: \n   - Multiple file creation events related to `winlogbeat.exe` and temporary files in unexpected locations can be a sign of data exfiltration or preparation for further malicious activities.\n\nThe combination of these behaviors across different processes makes the batch worth investigating, as they align with known tactics used by malware. The confidence is high but not absolute due to potential benign explanations that would require deeper context-specific analysis."}
