{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That seems normal because browsers do that all the time. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext up is whoami.exe being run. It's a legitimate tool used to check user information, so unless it's being abused in some way, this isn't concerning on its own.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell can be both good and bad since it's powerful. But access alone doesn't mean it's malicious yet.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file sounds like log shipping. That's part of normal operations if they're using the ELK stack or similar, so no red flags here.\n\nAnother powershell.exe accessing something again. Still, without context on what it's doing, it's hard to say. Maybe executing some commands.\n\nCmd.exe with a command line that uses certutil and calc.exe catches my eye. The command is trying to encode calc.exe into a text file and then decode it back. That sounds like a way to execute malicious code because encoding and decoding can be used to bypass certain security measures. This could be part of creating or running malware.\n\nThen, multiple events with certutil.exe doing registry writes. Certutil is usually for certificate operations, but when combined with writing to the registry, that might indicate persistence mechanisms or installing backdoors. Also, seeing it being called multiple times makes me think something's off.\n\nAnother cmd.exe and conhost.exe also writing to the registry. Conhost is typically a legitimate process, but if it's modifying the registry without clear purpose, could be malicious activity.\n\nRundll32.exe calling PcaSvc.dll sounds normal since rundll32 runs DLL functions, and PcaSvc is related to patching. Not suspicious unless there are other signs.\n\nSDXHelper.exe loading various system DLLs seems legitimate as it's part of the Windows OS component.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events with network connections. Chrome being a browser connecting to the internet is normal, so no issues here.\n\nPowershell.exe creating a file named 'componente_auxiliar.txt' in downloads. The name sounds generic, but without knowing what's inside, could be malicious. It might be dropping some component of malware.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several instances where certutil is used to encode and decode files, which suggests potential malware being created or executed. Multiple registry writes by different processes could indicate attempts to maintain persistence. The cmd.exe command line looks suspicious as it's trying to manipulate calc.exe into a different format, possibly to execute it in an undetected way.\n\nSo overall, these events seem like they could be part of malicious activities such as creating malware components, using legitimate tools for nefarious purposes, and establishing persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial Review:** Scanned through each log event to understand the processes involved.\n\n2. **Identified Suspicious Activities:**\n   - Use of `certutil.exe` for encoding\/decoding files, which can be used to create or execute malware.\n   - Multiple registry writes by different processes (`powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`), possibly indicating persistence mechanisms.\n   - A suspicious command in `cmd.exe` involving `calc.exe`, suggesting potential malware execution.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis:**\n   - The combination of encoding\/decoding and registry modifications raises concerns about malicious intent.\n   - Tools like `powershell.exe` and `certutil.exe` are powerful and often misused in attacks.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The activities observed, particularly the use of certutil for file manipulation and multiple registry writes, indicate potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe log events indicate suspicious activity involving potentially malicious tools and processes, making this batch interesting for further cybersecurity investigation. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Suspicious activities include use of certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding files, multiple registry writes, and a command suggesting potential malware execution.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's look through each event.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where \"chrome.exe\" is involved in setting registry values. These could be normal operations since Chrome often modifies settings via the registry. The same task repeats several times, which might not raise flags on their own but could indicate background updates or changes.\n\nNext, I see an entry from \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading \"urlmon.dll\". This seems suspicious because SDXHelper isn't a commonly known process, and loading urlmon, which is related to URL handling and could be used for malicious activities like downloading files. This might suggest some form of exploitation or persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is legitimate software, but creating a new config file here might not be unusual unless it's unexpected behavior specific to this setup.\n\nFinally, several events from \"powershell.exe\" accessing processes and registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. Multiple process access events could indicate reconnaissance or attempts to elevate privileges, which are red flags.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated registry writes in Chrome might not be malicious, but the combination with SDXHelper loading urlmon and multiple PowerShell activities suggests potential malicious behavior. This makes the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from 'chrome.exe' setting registry values, an event from 'SDXHelper.exe' loading a potentially suspicious DLL ('urlmon.dll'), and several events from 'powershell.exe' accessing processes and registry values. These activities could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
