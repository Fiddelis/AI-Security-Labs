Additionally, the presence of winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe performing file creation operations adds to the suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n``` \n\nThe high frequency of registry modifications by `chrome.exe` suggests an automated process potentially related to malicious software leveraging browser vulnerabilities. The use of other processes like `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` for file creation further supports the potential for a security breach or investigation-worthy activity. While these activities alone may not confirm malfeasance, their combination in this context is unusual enough to warrant closer inspection."}
