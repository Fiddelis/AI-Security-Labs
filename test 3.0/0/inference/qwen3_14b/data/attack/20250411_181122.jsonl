So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The possible classifications are INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the events. The first entry is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a normal command to get the current user. That's usually benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. The command line for one of them is a findstr and select-string command searching for 'password' in various file types. That seems suspicious because searching for passwords in files could be part of a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' with the same command line, which might indicate repeated attempts or a script that's running multiple times. The events also include image loads related to .NET frameworks and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading legitimate system files isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the other activities, it might be part of a larger process.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. The Pipe Created event could be used for inter-process communication, which is normal but might be abused by malicious software. The 'winlogbeat.exe' event seems to be related to a legitimate tool for log collection, but the presence of a new YAML file might be a red flag if it's not expected.\n\nThe 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' entries are standard applications, but the registry value set by notepad could be part of configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line might indicate that the PowerShell script is being executed multiple times, possibly to avoid detection or to perform multiple tasks.\n\nPutting this all together, the suspicious elements are the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the loading of certain DLLs. While some events are normal, the combination of these activities could indicate an attacker trying to find sensitive information. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, like data exfiltration or privilege escalation. So, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, but not conclusive proof of a breach. The confidence might be around 70%, as there are both benign and suspicious elements.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"justification\": \"The log contains multiple suspicious PowerShell activities, including repeated searches for 'password' in files (potential data exfiltration), temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of system DLLs.

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loading a file from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate security software. But then there's another entry where powershell is running a command to find passwords in files. That's a red flag. The command uses findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' and 'password' in various file types. This could be part of a password-gathering attempt, which is malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files, like the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be used to persist after reboot, which is a common tactic in malware. Also, there are several registry value set events, which could indicate changes to the system's configuration, maybe to hide the malware or modify behavior.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are mostly registry changes and DNS queries. While multiple DNS queries might be normal, if they're pointing to suspicious domains, that's a problem. But the logs here don't show the domains, so maybe not enough info. However, the presence of so many chrome.exe events could be a sign of something, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing is the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's just doing its job. But the filename has a .new extension, which might indicate a temporary file. Not sure if that's significant.\n\nPutting it all together, the most concerning parts are the powershell commands searching for passwords and the file creation in the Startup folder. These could indicate a malicious actor trying to extract sensitive information and persist on the system. The other events might be normal, but the combination of these specific actions raises suspicion. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, just potential indicators.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender path. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that might be legitimate. But maybe there's something else here. Then there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values and making network connections. A lot of network activity from chrome could be normal, but if it's excessive, that's a red flag. However, the same process doing multiple registry changes might be concerning.\n\nNext, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. That's not unusual, but when combined with other events, maybe. Then, winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's part of a legitimate setup. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could indicate some automated process.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign but can be used for privilege checking. Then, cmd.exe running schtasks commands to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks might be normal if they're malicious, but without context, it's hard to tell. However, the command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and similar, which might be part of a cleanup. But why delete them? Maybe to remove traces of previous activities.\n\nThen, schtasks.exe is used to delete another task, and there's an image load from taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler. That's normal. The svchost.exe changing registry objects is also part of normal system operations, but again, if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (chrome, powershell, cmd, schtasks) performing actions like creating files, modifying registry, deleting scheduled tasks. The network connections from chrome might be normal, but the combination with other activities could indicate something. However, there's no direct evidence of malware, like unexpected binaries or unusual network destinations. The presence of winlogbeat might be part of a monitoring setup. The whoami and schtasks commands are common in scripts, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI think the key points here are the multiple registry changes and network activity from chrome, along with the deletion of scheduled tasks. These could be part of a legitimate process, but they might also be part of a larger attack. However, without more indicators like unexpected processes, unusual network traffic, or file modifications, it's not conclusive. The logs don't show clear signs of malicious activity, but the combination of events might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of **normal system activities** and **potentially suspicious behaviors** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Potentially Suspicious Activities**\n#### **A. Unusual Process Behavior**\n- **`chrome.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component):**  \n  While `MpOAV.dll` is a legitimate file, its loading by `chrome.exe` is unusual. Chrome typically does not interact with Windows Defender components, and this could indicate **tampering** or **malware** attempting to mimic legitimate processes.\n\n- **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` deleting scheduled tasks:**  \n  The command `schtasks \/delete \/tn \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" \/f` suggests **deletion of scheduled tasks**. While this could be part of a cleanup, it may also be an attempt to **remove malicious tasks** or **cover tracks** of unauthorized activity.\n\n#### **B. Elevated Privilege Checks**\n- **`whoami.exe` execution:**  \n  This is a standard tool for checking user context, but its use in conjunction with other suspicious activities (e.g., task deletions) could indicate **privilege escalation attempts**.\n\n#### **C. Registry Modifications**\n- **Multiple `Registry value set` events (powershell.exe, cmd.exe):**  \n  Frequent registry changes by non-system processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`) may indicate **configuration changes** or **malware persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup entries).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Legitimate Activities**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` creating files (.winlogbeat.yml.new):**  \n  This is consistent with **log shipping\/configurations** for monitoring tools.\n- **`powershell.exe` creating files (estrutura_ativo.txt):**  \n  File creation in the `Downloads` folder is common for user-initiated actions.\n- **`svchost.exe` modifying registry objects:**  \n  `svchost.exe` is a standard host process for Windows services and may legitimately interact with the registry.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Red Flags**\n- **Lack of Context for Task Deletion:**  \n  The deletion of tasks named `\"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\"` and similar (with \"005\" in the name) could indicate **custom or malicious task names**. Without knowing the origin of these tasks, this warrants scrutiny.\n- **`chrome.exe` Network Activity:**  \n  While not inherently malicious, **excessive network connections** from `chrome.exe` (especially if not tied to user activity) could signal **malware communication** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:**  \n  Check for additional events (e.g., failed logins, unusual file modifications, or network traffic to suspicious IPs) that might confirm or rule out malicious intent.\n- **Investigate Scheduled Tasks:**  \n  Examine the deleted tasks (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, etc.) for evidence of prior malicious activity.\n- **Monitor `chrome.exe` Behavior:**  \n  Use tools like **process monitoring** or **network capture** to verify if `chrome.exe` is communicating with unexpected destinations.\n- **Check for PowerShell Scripting:**  \n  Investigate `powershell.exe` activity for signs of **script-based attacks** (e.g., obfuscated commands, lateral movement).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **not definitively malicious**, the combination of **unusual process behavior**, **registry modifications**, and **task deletions** raises **red flags** that require further investigation. This could indicate **benign user activity**, **malware**, or **misconfigured systems**. A deeper dive into context (e.g., user behavior, network traffic, and file contents) is necessary to determine the true nature of these events."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of schtasks.exe with a command to delete a scheduled task named \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That's a red flag because deleting a scheduled task could be part of a cleanup after executing malicious code. Then, there's the command line for cmd.exe using wmic to delete processes named notepad.exe. That seems suspicious because wmic is often used in attacks, and deleting notepad.exe might be an attempt to remove evidence or prevent monitoring.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry, setting values. While registry changes can be normal, the frequency here might indicate something malicious. Also, the use of whoami.exe and net.exe commands to delete user accounts (like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\") suggests that the attacker is trying to remove user accounts they created, which is a common post-exploitation activity.\n\nThe image load events for WMIC.exe loading urlmon.dll and amsi.dll are concerning. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's antimalware scanning, so loading it could be an attempt to bypass detection. Also, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might indicate the attacker is trying to interact with or disable the security software.\n\nThere's also a command using net1.exe, which isn't a standard Windows command. That's unusual and might be a typo or a renamed malicious tool. The repeated use of powershell.exe and the various registry modifications could be part of establishing persistence or altering system settings to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, using wmic and powershell for suspicious commands, modifying the registry, and attempting to delete user accounts points towards a potential security incident. The confidence is high because these actions are commonly associated with malware activities, such as cleanup, persistence, and evasion techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled tasks (schtasks.exe), use of wmic to delete processes, frequent registry modifications, deletion of user accounts via net.exe, and loading of potentially malicious DLLs (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll).

Some of these are common, like cmd and powershell, but their commands might indicate something. \n\nWait, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c net user \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". That looks like a command to delete a user from the domain. Deleting users isn't always bad, but if it's done without proper authorization, that's a red flag. Also, there's another command: \"sc delete win32times\", which is trying to delete a service. Deleting services can be part of a malicious activity, like removing a security tool or a legitimate service to hide other activities.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about registry value sets and process accesses. Frequent registry changes might indicate that something is modifying system settings, maybe to persist or hide. The ProcessAccess events could be normal, but combined with other suspicious commands, they might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, there are events related to User Account Management and Security Group Management. If an attacker is modifying user accounts or groups, that's a significant security issue. However, the logs don't show the context of who is performing these actions. If these events are from a legitimate admin, it's okay, but without knowing the user, it's hard to tell. But since the logs don't mention the user, maybe that's a clue that something is wrong.\n\nAnother thing is the use of PowerShell and CMD together. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but combined with CMD commands that modify system settings or delete users, it might be part of a script that's trying to escalate privileges or remove traces.\n\nHowever, not all events are suspicious. For example, whoami.exe is a standard tool to check the current user, and services.exe is a legitimate process. But when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There are enough suspicious commands and events that suggest potential malicious activity, but without more context like user information or IP addresses, it's not 100% certain.

That's a common activity, but not necessarily malicious. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's trying to delete temporary files. The command line shows some file deletions, which might be normal cleanup, but the paths mentioned are in the Temp directory, which could be suspicious if they're deleting files that shouldn't be there.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. The cmd.exe also has a file delete event for a file named tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. The names of these files have \"calc\" and \"decoded\" in them, which might be red flags. Sometimes attackers use decoded files to execute malicious code.\n\nThen, there are several entries where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Defender might indicate that something is trying to interact with antivirus, which could be a sign of evasion techniques.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces. The file name has \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a legitimate script, but the quick creation and deletion could be suspicious.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry modifications and file operations might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or execute commands. The combination of these actions—deleting files, modifying the registry, and using PowerShell—could be part of a larger attack, like installing malware or a backdoor.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks. But the specific commands and the sequence of events here do seem suspicious. The fact that multiple registry events and file deletions are happening, along with the use of decoded files, raises a red flag. \n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows activities that are commonly associated with malicious behavior, even though some individual events might be normal. The combination of these events, especially the file deletions in Temp, registry changes, and the use of PowerShell for potentially hidden operations, makes this batch interesting for further investigation.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Let me check the specific tasks. There's a 'Pipe Created' event, which might be normal, but then there are several 'Process accessed' events. That could indicate someone trying to manipulate or monitor processes, which is suspicious.\n\nLooking at the files involved, one entry mentions the creation of a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store data. Also, there's a reference to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be legitimate, but if it's being accessed in an unusual way, it could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. While whoami is a standard command, repeated executions might be part of a script or a reconnaissance effort. However, by itself, that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for urlmon.dll are normal since that's part of Internet Explorer. But the presence of 'Calculator.exe' might be a typo or a different process name, but it's still a legitimate executable.\n\nThere are also events involving 'Registry value set' for various processes. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a common tactic in malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated 'Process accessed' events and the creation of files in user directories might indicate suspicious activity.
