{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. The winlog tasks mention ProcessAccess and ProcessCreate. Then there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a common command for checking user context. But that's normal, maybe part of a script.\n\nThen, looking further, there's a command line in one of the processes that's using PowerShell to take screenshots. The code uses System.Windows.Forms to capture the screen and save it as a PNG in the Temp directory. That's unusual because taking screenshots isn't a typical benign activity. It could be part of a legitimate tool, but combined with the frequency of PowerShell events, it might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are normal, the repeated loading might indicate something trying to inject code or use PowerShell for malicious purposes.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to save screenshots in the Temp folder could be an indicator of someone trying to exfiltrate data. Screenshots might capture sensitive information, and saving them in Temp could be a way to avoid leaving traces. However, I should check if there's any other context, like network activity or file transfers, but those aren't present here.\n\nThe presence of multiple similar command lines suggests automation or a script that's being run multiple times. This could be part of a larger attack, like data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The combination of ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, and ImageLoad events with PowerShell and screenshot-taking seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.75. The justification is the repeated PowerShell activity, screenshot saving, and possible data exfiltration attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands to capture screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory, which could indicate data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, looking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, using Add-Type to load System.Windows.Forms, then capturing the screen and saving it as a PNG in the Temp directory. That's a lot of screen captures saved with different names like estrutura_ativo.png, modulo_principal.png, etc.\n\nNow, why would someone do that? Maybe they're taking screenshots for legitimate reasons, but the repetition and the number of times it's happening might be suspicious. Also, there are events about files being created and deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1 file. That could be part of a script that's being tested or executed, but then deleted, which might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThere's also a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper, but that might be normal. However, the multiple PowerShell processes and the registry changes could indicate some kind of persistent activity or configuration changes. The remote command executions and pipeline executions might be part of a larger attack, like deploying malware or establishing a backdoor.\n\nBut wait, some of these events might be benign. For example, the file creation and deletion could be part of normal PowerShell operations. However, the repeated screen captures are unusual. Taking multiple screenshots of the screen and saving them in the Temp folder could be part of a data exfiltration attempt, where the attacker is capturing sensitive information displayed on the screen.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the use of the System.Windows.Forms assembly might be a red flag. Typically, attackers use PowerShell for various malicious activities, including screen capturing to steal information. The fact that the same command is executed multiple times with different filenames suggests automation or a script that's running repeatedly.\n\nOn the other hand, the registry events and process accesses might be part of legitimate software updates or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The key points here are the repeated screen captures, the temporary files created and deleted, and the multiple PowerShell activities. These could indicate a potential security threat, so the logs are interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, particularly due to the **repeated use of PowerShell for screen capture** and **potential lateral movement or data exfiltration**. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated PowerShell Screen Capture Activity**\n- **Multiple PowerShell commands** (e.g., `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms`, followed by screen capture and saving as PNG files in the Temp directory) appear **10+ times** with different filenames (e.g., `estrutura_ativo.png`, `modulo_principal.png`, etc.).\n  - **Why this is suspicious**: \n    - **Screen capture** is often used in **data exfiltration** (e.g., stealing sensitive information displayed on the screen).\n    - The **repetition** and automation suggest **scripting** (e.g., a malicious actor capturing screenshots periodically to gather intel or monitor user activity).\n\n---\n\n### **2. File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory**\n- A temporary PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1`) is **created and deleted** (via `File created` and `File deleted` events).\n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - **Ephemeral files** are common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n    - The filename (`PSScriptPolicyTest`) may be a **misleading name** to mimic legitimate PowerShell testing scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Remote Command Execution and Pipeline Activity**\n- **Multiple `Execute a Remote Command`** and **`Executing Pipeline`** events are logged.\n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - Indicates **remote interaction** (e.g., an attacker executing commands on the system via remote access tools or a compromised service).\n    - Could signal **lateral movement** or **command-and-control (C2) communication**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Registry Modifications**\n- **Registry value set** events are logged for multiple processes (`powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`).\n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - **Unusual registry changes** (e.g., adding persistence mechanisms, modifying execution policies, or disabling security tools) are often part of **malware installation** or **privilege escalation**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Legitimate vs. Malicious Context**\n- **Legitimate activities**:\n  - PowerShell is widely used for **administrative tasks**, and registry changes can be part of **software updates** or **user configuration**.\n  - Screen capture might be used in **remote support tools** or **monitoring applications**.\n- **Malicious indicators**:\n  - **Lack of clear purpose** for the repeated screen captures.\n  - **No apparent user interaction** (e.g., no logs of user initiating the screensaver or remote session).\n  - **Unusual persistence** (e.g., registry changes without user consent).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Analyze the PowerShell scripts**:\n   - Check the contents of the deleted `__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1` file (if available in logs or disk artifacts).\n   - Look for obfuscation or encoded commands.\n2. **Correlate with network traffic**:\n   - Investigate if the PNG files were exfiltrated (e.g., via HTTP\/FTP or C2 communication).\n3. **Check for lateral movement**:\n   - Investigate the `Execute a Remote Command` events (e.g., were they initiated by a compromised system?).\n4. **Review user activity**:\n   - Confirm if the user (`fiddelis`) authorized these actions or if there are signs of **account compromise** (e.g., unusual login times, locations).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **highly suspicious behavior** consistent with **malicious activity**, including **screen capture for data exfiltration**, **ephemeral file usage**, and **unauthorized remote execution**. These events should be **investigated further** to confirm whether they represent a **security breach** or **legitimate activity**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at this batch of events. All the entries are about Chrome.exe performing various actions. The majority of them are related to registry value sets, which is normal for Chrome as it often modifies the registry for settings. There's also a DNS query, which is typical for browsing. However, there are two image loaded events. The first one is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. That's a legitimate file, so loading it from System32 seems okay. The second one is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's Platform. That's also a legitimate file used for real-time protection.\n\nNow, considering that all these events are related to Chrome.exe, which is a common browser, and the files involved are standard Windows Defender components, there's no obvious malicious activity here. The repetition of registry changes might be normal for Chrome's operation. However, I should check if there's any unusual pattern. Since the justification for classification is based on the combination of events, and all the loaded files are legitimate, this batch doesn't show signs of a security threat. Therefore, it's likely not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Chrome.exe activity with no suspicious file paths or anomalous behavior detected.
