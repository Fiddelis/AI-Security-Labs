{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be normal. Notepad changing the registry? Maybe, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. The next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon is a standard DLL, so that's normal. But then there's a cmd.exe process with a long command line. The command line includes schtasks to create scheduled tasks named things like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The tasks are set to run calc.exe on logon and startup. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks to run calc.exe might be part of a persistence mechanism. Also, the command line uses schtasks with \/create, which is a way to set up tasks that run automatically. \n\nLooking further, there's another schtasks.exe process creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. Then, svchost.exe is creating files in the Tasks directory, like \"pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\" and \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\". Svchost is a legitimate process, but creating files in the system's Tasks folder could be part of setting up persistent tasks. \n\nAlso, the command lines have some odd naming conventions with \"005\" and words like \"modulo_principal\" and \"pacote_comum\" which might be obfuscation or part of a naming scheme used by attackers. The fact that multiple scheduled tasks are created to run calc.exe on logon and startup suggests an attempt to maintain access or execute code at system startup. \n\nAnother point is that the same tasks are being created multiple times, which might be redundant, but could also be part of a script that's trying to ensure the task is set even if previous attempts failed. The use of \"system\" as the user for one of the tasks (\\\/ru system) means it's running with high privileges, which is a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple scheduled tasks created with suspicious names, using calc.exe (which is a simple calculator but could be a placeholder for malicious code), and the use of schtasks and svchost.exe to create these tasks. This behavior is indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence on the system. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe are legitimate, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with unusual names and using system-level privileges is suspicious. Therefore, this batch of logs is likely worth investigating further for potential security threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Abnormal Scheduled Task Creation**  \n   - Multiple `schtasks.exe` processes create tasks with cryptic names (e.g., `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`, `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon`) and set them to execute `calc.exe` on **system startup\/logon**.  \n   - **Why this is suspicious**:  \n     - `calc.exe` is a benign calculator, but attackers often use it as a placeholder for malicious payloads (e.g., obfuscation, execution of hidden code).  \n     - Scheduled tasks named with non-English terms (e.g., `modulo_principal`, `pacote_comum`) may indicate obfuscation or evasion tactics.  \n     - Tasks are configured to run as **`system`** (high-privilege account), suggesting an attempt to bypass user-level restrictions.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation by `svchost.exe`**  \n   - `svchost.exe` (a legitimate Windows process) creates files in the systemâ€™s **`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\`** directory (e.g., `pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup`).  \n   - **Why this is suspicious**:  \n     - `svchost.exe` is often abused by malware to host malicious payloads or create persistence mechanisms.  \n     - File creation in the `Tasks` directory aligns with the scheduled task creation, suggesting a coordinated effort to establish persistence.\n\n3. **`cmd.exe` with Malformed Command Lines**  \n   - A `cmd.exe` process executes a command line with obfuscated task creation commands (e.g., `schtasks \/create \/tn \"...\" \/sc onstart \/ru system \/tr \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\"`).  \n   - **Why this is suspicious**:  \n     - The use of `\/ru system` grants the task **system-level privileges**, which is highly unusual for benign tasks.  \n     - The command includes `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe`, which may mask the execution of malicious code (e.g., downloading payloads or executing scripts).\n\n4. **Frequent Use of `svchost.exe` and `schtasks.exe`**  \n   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` and `schtasks.exe` are logged, with some processes having no command-line arguments.  \n   - **Why this is suspicious**:  \n     - This could indicate **process injection** or **malware evasion** (e.g., using legitimate processes to host malicious code).  \n     - The lack of command-line arguments in some logs may suggest the use of **in-memory execution** or **dropper techniques**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Red Flags**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The creation of multiple scheduled tasks with system-level privileges suggests an attempt to **establish long-term access** to the system.  \n- **Obfuscation**: Non-English task names and cryptic filenames (e.g., `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`) may indicate **malware obfuscation** or **custom attack frameworks**.  \n- **Privilege Escalation**: Running tasks as the `system` account is a strong indicator of **privilege escalation** or **exploitation of system vulnerabilities**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Check for Malicious Payloads**:  \n   - Analyze the contents of the created files in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\` (e.g., `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon`).  \n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **ProcDump** to inspect `svchost.exe` and `schtasks.exe` for injected code.\n\n2. **Monitor Network Activity**:  \n   - Check if `calc.exe` or other processes are communicating with external IPs (e.g., C2 servers).  \n   - Use **Wireshark** or **Zeek** to trace network connections.\n\n3. **Check for Signs of Compromise**:  \n   - Scan the system for **malware signatures** using tools like **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky**.  \n   - Review the **Windows Event Log** for **security events** (e.g., `4688` for process creation, `4698` for task creation).\n\n4. **Isolate the System**:  \n   - If confirmed malicious, **isolate the system** from the network and perform a **full forensic analysis**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch shows **strong signs of a persistence mechanism** being deployed via **scheduled tasks and process injection**. The use of `svchost.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, and system-level privileges aligns with **malware behavior**. Immediate investigation is recommended to mitigate potential compromise."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. Hmm, there's a lot of activity from chrome.exe, which is normal, but I need to check for anything suspicious. Let's see, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads directory. That's part of the Elastic stack, so maybe it's just a monitoring tool. Then, there's a file created by powershell.exe called unidade_ativo.txt. That could be a red flag if it's related to data exfiltration. Also, there are multiple registry value set events. Some are from legitimate processes like svchost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe, which are normal. However, chrome.exe repeatedly setting registry values might be unusual. Also, there's an image loaded from amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. That's normal, but maybe if there's something else. Wait, the user is running whoami.exe, which is a standard command, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be a sign. However, the main suspicious thing here is the file created by powershell.exe. It's possible that this is a benign activity, but combined with the multiple registry changes and the presence of winlogbeat, which is a monitoring tool, maybe someone is trying to set up something. However, without more context, like network activity or other malicious files, it's hard to say. The confidence isn't too high, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with file creation in user downloads directory, suggest potential malicious activity.
