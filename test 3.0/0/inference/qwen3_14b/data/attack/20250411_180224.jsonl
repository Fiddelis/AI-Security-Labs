{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving 'schtasks.exe' creating scheduled tasks. For example, there's a command line that uses 'schtasks \/create' with '\/ru system' and '\/sc daily', which means it's setting up a task to run as the system user daily. The command line includes running PowerShell with '-ep bypass' and a script path like 'c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Wait, the script name is NonExistingScript.ps1, which might be a red flag because it's trying to execute a non-existent file. That could be an attempt to run a malicious script that's not present, maybe to avoid detection.\n\nAnother entry shows 'schtasks.exe' creating a task named 'win32times' with the same PowerShell command. The fact that the same task is created multiple times might be suspicious. Also, the 'cmd.exe' process is involved in creating this task, which is a common method for attackers to execute commands.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell entries, there's a mention of '-ep bypass', which is used to bypass execution policies. That's often used in attacks to run scripts without being blocked. The script paths mentioned are non-existent, which could be a sign of a failed attack or a decoy.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events, which could indicate changes to the registry, maybe to persist the attack or modify system settings. However, some of these are from 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe', which might be normal, but the combination with the scheduled tasks is concerning.\n\nThere are also 'File created' events for '.winlogbeat.yml.new' and 'estrutura_geral.txt', but those might be part of legitimate software installation or configuration. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell and schtasks activities points towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' command is standard for checking user context, but in this case, it's part of the process chain which might be part of the attacker's reconnaissance.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell commands that reference non-existent scripts, using bypass execution policies, and multiple registry changes could indicate a potential security threat. However, some events might be benign. But the overall pattern suggests something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with PowerShell commands referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), use of '-ep bypass' to bypass execution policies, and repeated registry modifications. These patterns are commonly associated with malicious persistence mechanisms and potential script-based attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
