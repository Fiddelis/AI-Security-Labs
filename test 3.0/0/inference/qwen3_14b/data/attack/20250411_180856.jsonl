{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. There are multiple network connections from chrome, but that's typical unless there's an unusual number. However, the repetition here might just be normal activity.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but when combined with certain commands, it can be malicious. Looking at the cmd.exe event, the command line is \"wmic process call create notepad.exe\". That's a standard way to launch processes, but not inherently malicious. However, wmic is sometimes used in attacks.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events for WMIC.exe loading dlls. The paths include urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and some Windows Defender dlls. These are legitimate system files, but if they're being loaded from unexpected places or in unusual contexts, that could be a red flag. However, the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. But the filename is .yml.new, which might be part of a normal setup. However, if this is part of an unexpected configuration change, that could be suspicious. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the other events: svchost.exe and services.exe are normal system processes. The logon events might be part of regular user activity. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is also a standard system behavior.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's no clear pattern of malicious activity. The majority of events are from legitimate processes. The use of WMIC and PowerShell is common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios, but without additional indicators like unusual command lines, unexpected network destinations, or unauthorized access, it's hard to classify this as suspicious. The repetition of network connections from chrome might be normal browsing. The ImageLoad events for system dlls are expected. The winlogbeat file creation is part of normal operation if it's a legitimate installation.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple events involving WMIC and PowerShell could be a sign of someone trying to execute commands or manipulate the system. But again, without more context or anomalies, it's not conclusive. The confidence here is moderate. Maybe there's something I'm missing, but based on the given data, it's not clearly malicious. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system and user activity (e.g., Chrome browser network traffic, standard PowerShell\/cmd.exe operations, legitimate Windows processes). No clear indicators of compromise, suspicious command lines, or anomalous behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of chrome.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe. The first thing that stands out is the use of WMIC.exe loading several DLLs, including urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and files from Windows Defender. Now, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. But if a malicious process is doing so, it might be trying to bypass detection. However, in this case, the process is WMIC.exe, which is a legitimate tool, but it's often abused by attackers. \n\nThen there's the command line in one of the events: \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process call create notepad.exe\". This is a common technique used by malware to execute processes indirectly. Using WMIC to create a process can be a red flag because it's often used in attacks to evade detection. \n\nAnother thing is the multiple instances of Network connection detected events from chrome.exe. While chrome might have legitimate network activity, if it's excessive or unusual, it could indicate something wrong. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThere's also the use of whoami.exe, which is a standard tool to check user context. That alone isn't suspicious, but if combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory isn't necessarily bad, but if that's part of a data exfiltration or configuration, it could be a concern. However, the log only shows the file creation, not any data being sent out.\n\nLooking at the previous logs, there were several registry value changes and process accesses. The repeated ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which could be a sign of compromise.\n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious parts are the use of WMIC to execute processes, the loading of Defender DLLs by WMIC, and the multiple registry changes. These could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code or manipulate the system. However, some of these activities could be legitimate, especially if the user is running scripts or tools that use these commands. But given the combination of events, it's worth investigating further to rule out potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n### **1. Use of `WMIC.exe` for Process Execution**\n- **Event Example**:  \n  `cmd.exe \/c wmic process call create notepad.exe`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  This is a classic technique used by attackers to execute processes indirectly, often to evade detection. While `WMIC.exe` is a legitimate tool, its use here could indicate an attempt to launch malicious payloads (e.g., `notepad.exe` being a dropper or proxy for other malicious activities).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Loading of `amsi.dll` and Defender-Related DLLs**\n- **Events**:  \n  `WMIC.exe` loading `amsi.dll` (part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface) and `urlmon.dll` (used for web browsing).  \n  **Risk**:  \n  While these DLLs are legitimate, their loading by `WMIC.exe` (often abused by malware) could indicate an attempt to **bypass detection** or **interact with security features** (e.g., disabling Defender via AMSI bypass).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Repeated `ProcessAccess` Events for `powershell.exe`**\n- **Events**:  \n  Multiple logs show `powershell.exe` being accessed or monitored.  \n  **Risk**:  \n  This could indicate **post-exploitation activity** (e.g., privilege escalation, data exfiltration) or **malicious scripting**. PowerShell is a common tool for lateral movement and persistence in attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Unusual File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`**\n- **Event**:  \n  `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file:  \n  `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  While `winlogbeat` is a legitimate log shipper, the creation of a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory could indicate **misconfiguration**, **data tampering**, or **malicious use** of the tool (e.g., exfiltrating logs).\n\n---\n\n### **5. `whoami.exe` Execution**\n- **Event**:  \n  `whoami.exe` executed with the command:  \n  `\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\"`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  While `whoami.exe` is a standard utility for checking user context, its execution in combination with other suspicious activities (e.g., `WMIC`, `powershell`) could signal **privilege escalation** or **reconnaissance**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Unusual Logon Events**\n- **Events**:  \n  - `services.exe` with task `Logon`  \n  - `None` with task `Special Logon`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  These could indicate **unauthorized access** or **compromised credentials**, especially if paired with other suspicious activities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n- **High Risk**:  \n  - Use of `WMIC.exe` to execute processes (`notepad.exe`).  \n  - Loading of `amsi.dll` and `urlmon.dll` by `WMIC.exe`.  \n- **Medium Risk**:  \n  - Repeated `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe`.  \n  - Unusual file creation by `winlogbeat.exe`.  \n  - `whoami.exe` execution in a potentially malicious context.  \n- **Low Risk**:  \n  - Legitimate activities (e.g., `chrome.exe` network traffic, `svchost.exe` processes).  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate `WMIC.exe` and `powershell.exe` activities** for signs of malicious scripts or payloads.  \n2. **Check the contents of the `.yml.new` file** created by `winlogbeat.exe` to rule out data exfiltration.  \n3. **Monitor for AMSI bypass techniques** (e.g., `amsi.dll` tampering).  \n4. **Review logon events** for unauthorized access or credential misuse.  \n5. **Validate the legitimacy of `winlogbeat.exe`** and ensure no misconfiguration or tampering.  \n\nFurther analysis (e.g., memory dumps, network traffic inspection) is recommended to confirm whether these activities are benign or part of a security incident."}
