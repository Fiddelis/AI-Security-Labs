{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed and accessing processes, which could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Also, there's a cmd.exe command that uses WMIC to create notepad.exe, which might indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary commands. The file creation by powershell.exe and winlogbeat could be creating new files in user directories, possibly writing malicious content or data exfiltration. The combination of these events seems suspicious and indicates potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, which is often used for malicious activities.
