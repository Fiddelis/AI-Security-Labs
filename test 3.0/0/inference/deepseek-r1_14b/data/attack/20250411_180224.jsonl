{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line has a process, some Windows log task info, and possibly a file path.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: there's powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and whoami.exe. I know that powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because of its scripting capabilities. The fact that it's being called with -ep bypass in the command line might indicate an attempt to bypass execution policies, which is a red flag.\n\nI see multiple instances where schtasks.exe is used to create scheduled tasks. Specifically, they're using commands like schtasks \/create and \/query with task names like win32times. This seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The script paths in the command line point to NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1, which are not valid files. That's a sign that these might be attempts to execute malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe multiple times with registry modifications. Svchost is typically associated with legitimate services, but it can also be used by malware. The fact that it's modifying the registry suggests potential persistence or configuration changes that could be harmful.\n\nThere are several events where chrome.exe is making registry changes. While Chrome can write to the registry for its settings, multiple such events might indicate something unusual, especially if they're not related to normal browsing activities.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe process is creating files in a specific path. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting Windows logs, so this seems legitimate unless there's evidence it's being misused here.\n\nPowershell.exe is also creating files named estrutura_geral.txt and entrada_ativo.txt. Without knowing the contents, it's hard to say, but combined with other suspicious activities, this could be part of data exfiltration or malicious script execution.\n\nThere are a couple of whoami.exe executions, which usually just return user information. But in some cases, they can be used for reconnaissance or part of more malicious activity.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell executions with potentially malicious parameters, creation of scheduled tasks pointing to non-existing scripts, registry modifications by svchost and cmd, and the use of schtasks for creating tasks. These are common tactics in malware and attack chains, especially related to persistence, privilege escalation, or data theft.\n\nThe confidence level is high because several red flags are present across different processes and events. The combination suggests a possible malicious campaign rather than normal system activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe with bypass flag, creation of scheduled tasks with non-existing scripts, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and potential data file creations.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"high\"\n}\n```"}
