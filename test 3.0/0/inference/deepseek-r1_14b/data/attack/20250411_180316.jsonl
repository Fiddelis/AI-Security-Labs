{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because many Windows processes interact with the registry.\n\nNext is Notepad.exe also setting a registry value. Notpad is usually innocent, but sometimes malware can use it. But I don't see anything suspicious here yet.\n\nThen there's PowerShell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used for both good and bad things. Without more context on what command was run, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll... Wait, that seems odd. Why would Calculator need to load URL-related DLLs? Maybe it's a sign of something suspicious, but maybe not. Sometimes legitimate apps load various DLLs for different purposes.\n\nSVCHost.exe setting registry values multiple times. SVCHost can host many services, so it's expected to see activity here. But repeated writes could be concerning if they're unusual for the system.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file. That looks like a log management tool, probably not an issue.\n\nAnother PowerShell access event. Again, just access without specific commands is hard to judge.\n\nWhoami.exe being run from command line. This is a common command to check user permissions, so likely benign.\n\nPowershell again, accessing something. Still no concrete evidence of malicious activity.\n\nApplicationFrameHost and Calculator both setting registry values. Not immediately suspicious on their own.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command that deletes notepad.exe via wmic. That's interesting because deleting processes can be a way to cover tracks. Using WMIC adds a layer of obfuscation, which might indicate bad intentions. This could be part of a larger script trying to hide its presence.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where files are loaded or registry changes happen with URL-related DLLs and others. Some of these might be legitimate, but combined with the cmd.exe command, it raises some flags.\n\nOverall, while most events individually don't seem suspicious, the combination—especially the deletion of processes using WMIC and the repeated use of PowerShell without clear benign activity—could indicate malicious behavior. However, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes systems have scripts that perform cleanup or legitimate process management.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities such as registry modifications by various processes, including powershell.exe and cmd.exe executing commands to delete notepad.exe.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is 'Registry value set'. This seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings and extensions. There are several such events, but nothing unusual here yet.\n\nNext, there's a 'powershell.exe' event with 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. I'll keep an eye out for other suspicious actions associated with it.\n\nThen, there's a 'whoami.exe' process being created. This tool is often used to check user permissions and might be part of reconnaissance by attackers. However, without additional context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances where 'cmd.exe' is run with specific command lines. For example, one command copies a file named 'sethc_backup.exe' to 'sethc.exe'. This might be an attempt to replace system binaries, which could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command line stands out: '\/c schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f'. This deletes a scheduled task named 'win32times', which could be part of removing traces or disabling monitoring tools. This is definitely concerning.\n\nThere's also an event where 'schtasks.exe' is used to delete the same task, reinforcing the idea that someone is trying to remove task-based monitoring or persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries involving registry modifications and process creations for processes like 'svchost.exe', which can be part of legitimate system operations but can also be used maliciously. The repeated registry value sets across different processes might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations stealthily.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using PowerShell, whoami, cmd with specific commands, and deleting scheduled tasks suggests potential malicious behavior.

Let me break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes like cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and powershell.exe. Notably, powershell.exe appears several times with various tasks such as Process accessed, Registry value set, Image loaded, and File created.\n\nLooking at the tasks:\n- Registry value sets in cmd.exe and conhost.exe might indicate attempts to modify system configurations.\n- The 'whoami.exe' process is used, which typically retrieves user information. Its command line doesn't show any suspicious arguments here.\n- powershell.exe is involved in multiple events: accessing processes, modifying registry values, loading images, and creating a file in the Temp directory.\n\nThe creation of a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 in the user's AppData\/Local\/Temp folder by powershell.exe is concerning. This seems like it could be part of script execution to test policy settings or potentially execute malicious scripts.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll and related .NET files loaded by powershell.exe, which isn't unusual but combined with other actions might raise suspicion.\n\nThe repetitive use of cmd.exe and the creation of temporary PowerShell scripts could indicate attempts at persistence or lateral movement within a network. However, without additional context like timestamps or source IPs, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. Still, the volume of activity from powershell.exe is a red flag, as attackers often abuse it for command execution and script downloading.\n\nIn summary, while some activities are normal, the pattern suggests potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes:**\n   - cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and powershell.exe are involved in multiple events.\n\n2. **Analyze Task Types:**\n   - Registry modifications ( SetValue) could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n   - Process access indicates potential lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n   - Image loading might be related to loading malicious libraries.\n   - File creation suggests script execution or data storage for later use.\n\n3. **Spot Suspicious Activities:**\n   - The creation of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory by powershell.exe is suspicious, as it could indicate malicious scripting.\n   - Repetitive use of powershell.exe with varied tasks raises concern about potential attack activities.\n\n4. **Consider Context and Timing:**\n   - Without knowing if these processes are part of legitimate operations (e.g., user scripts), the activity seems unusual but not definitive proof of compromise.\n\n5. **Assess Risk Level:**\n   - The combination of registry modifications, process access, image loading, and file creation by powershell.exe indicates a high risk of potential malicious activity.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events is considered **interesting for investigation**, particularly due to the suspicious activities involving powershell.exe and the creation of a potentially malicious script. It suggests possible unauthorized access or malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line containing a single JSON object representing an event. Each event has three main components: process information, winlog (Windows log), and file details.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. **Event 1**: PowerShell.exe is involved in deleting a file. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The deletion of a script file (.ps1) might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt operations, which raises red flags.\n\n2. **Events 2-7**: Multiple entries show PowerShell.exe being executed with \"& {}\". This syntax is typically used in command-line arguments to execute scripts or commands. Repeated instances can be part of scripting or automated processes. However, considering the context of these events alongside others might make them more suspicious.\n\n3. **Event 8**: Winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is usually related to log shipping and management, so this seems benign unless there's something unusual about the file path or timing.\n\n4. **Event 9**: Another PowerShell event involving pipe creation. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication but could also be part of malicious activities like command injection or lateral movement.\n\n5. **Events 10-13**: These show various tasks related to image loading, file creation, and registry changes by PowerShell.exe. While these actions aren't inherently malicious, they might indicate script execution or configuration changes, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\n6. **Event 14**: A \"whoami.exe\" process creation. This is commonly used to determine user information and can be part of legitimate system administration tasks or as part of privilege escalation in attacks. It's worth noting if this occurs without proper authorization.\n\n7. **Events 15-20**: These events involve PowerShell executing complex command lines that check for the existence of specific files (e.g., script.bat). The use of conditional checks might be an attempt to ensure certain scripts exist before proceeding, which could be part of a malicious payload execution or legitimate system checks. However, the repeated pattern and different paths suggest some level of automation or testing.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, several red flags emerge:\n\n- **PowerShell Activities**: Multiple events involve PowerShell.exe, including deletions, pipe creations, file operations, registry changes, and script checks. While PowerShell is a powerful tool for system admins, its misuse is common in cyberattacks.\n  \n- **File Deletion**: The initial event deletes a PowerShell script. Adversaries often delete their own scripts to erase evidence or prevent analysis.\n\n- **Registry Changes**: Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation tactics.\n\n- **Repetitive Command-Line Arguments**: The repeated use of \"& { ... }\" in command lines suggests automated or scripted behavior, possibly indicating malicious activity like a script trying different paths to execute.\n\n- **File Existence Checks**: The scripts check for the existence of multiple .bat files across various directories. This might be an attempt to ensure execution from multiple points or test if certain tools are present, which could be part of a multi-stage attack.\n\nWhile some events on their own might not be suspicious (like Winlogbeat creating a file), the combination of several concerning activities involving PowerShell and file operations suggests a potential security incident. The patterns in command-line arguments and script checks add to the suspicion that this isn't just routine system activity but something more nefarious, such as an ongoing attack or post-attack behavior.\n\nTherefore, these logs should be flagged for further investigation, especially focusing on the PowerShell activities and their outcomes. It's crucial to determine if these actions are part of authorized operations or unauthorized malicious attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity. Key points include:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Activities**: Numerous entries show PowerShell.exe performing various tasks, including file deletions, pipe creations, and registry modifications. These actions can be both legitimate and malicious.\n\n2. **File Deletion**: The initial event deletes a .ps1 script, which could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt operations.\n\n3. **Registry Changes**: Modifying the registry is common in attacks for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n4. **Repetitive Command-Line Arguments**: The use of \"& { ... }\" suggests automated behavior, possibly part of a malicious script.\n\n5. **File Existence Checks**: Scripts check for .bat files across various directories, which could be testing for tools or executing from multiple points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these activities strongly suggests potential malicious intent. These logs should be investigated further to determine if they are part of an unauthorized attack. \n\n**Answer:** The logs indicate suspicious activity and require further investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line has three main parts: process info, winlog, and file info.\n\nFirst, I see that most of these events involve powershell.exe. That immediately stands out because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware often uses it to execute scripts or commands in a way that's harder to detect compared to other shells.\n\nLooking closer at the first event: process is powershell.exe, task is Process Create. The command line seems to have some if-else condition checking whether a file exists, exiting 0 if it does, else 1. That feels a bit odd. Why would a script exit based on the existence of another file? Maybe trying to check if certain components are present before proceeding.\n\nThen there's a series of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe—so maybe some access checks or privilege escalations happening here. The Image loaded tasks show various DLLs being loaded by PowerShell, which is normal but sometimes attackers inject malicious libraries. I should check the file paths; mscoree.dll and others are legitimate .NET components, so that might be okay.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event for a script in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. It’s created and then immediately deleted—maybe trying to avoid detection by not leaving files around? Or perhaps testing if the system allows certain scripts to run. That behavior could be suspicious because it's a common tactic in attacks to test the environment without persisting.\n\nAnother FileCreate event for elemento_padrao.txt in Downloads. Not sure what that is, but creating files might indicate some data exfiltration or configuration changes. The path seems normal, though.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe. That's unusual because Chrome shouldn't be writing to the registry that much unless it's a legitimate update. But seeing eight of these events makes me wonder if this is part of some larger activity. Could be related to persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations in a way that could later execute malicious code.\n\nLooking at the Pipe Created event for powershell.exe—pipes are often used for inter-process communication. In attacks, they might be used to create hidden channels for command and control or data transfer between processes. This could be a red flag.\n\nTwo more events where powershell.exe is executed with similar command lines as before but different paths. It seems like multiple instances of checking file existence in various directories. Could the script be trying to locate certain files across multiple locations, perhaps part of a payload that needs specific components?\n\nThe last few events show loading MpClient.dll and creating a StartupProfileData file. Defender's DLLs are loaded, so that might not be suspicious on its own, but the profile data creation could indicate some configuration changes or attempts to store data in non-standard locations.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances checking for files, creating temporary scripts quickly, registry modifications from an unexpected source (chrome.exe), and pipe creations. These behaviors aren't necessarily malicious on their own, but they raise eyebrows because they can be indicators of attack. The repeated checks for specific files might suggest a payload trying to ensure its components are in place before executing something more serious.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards this being potentially suspicious. It's not clear-cut, but the combination of powershell.exe usage, file creation\/deletion patterns, registry changes, and pipe activities is enough to warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity:**\n   - The logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific files.\n\n2. **Analyze Command Lines:**\n   - Commands like `if (Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}` suggest the script is checking for files and exiting based on their presence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - `chrome.exe` making multiple registry writes could indicate an attempt to modify system settings, possibly for persistence or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Temporary Script Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - Powershell creates scripts in the Temp directory then deletes them. This behavior can be a tactic to avoid detection by leaving no trace.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation Event:**\n   - The creation of a pipe by `powershell.exe` could indicate communication between processes, possibly for command and control or data transfer.\n\n6. **File Operations:**\n   - Creating files in the Downloads directory might be part of data exfiltration or configuration changes, which is suspicious if not related to normal user activity.\n\n7. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Loading known legitimate DLLs like `mscoree.dll` isn't malicious, but attackers can inject malicious libraries into processes, so this needs monitoring.\n\n8. **File Path Analysis:**\n   - The paths checked in the command lines (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`) seem structured and might be part of a larger file infection or persistence strategy.\n\n9. **Combine Observations:**\n   - The combination of powershell.exe usage, registry changes from an unexpected process, temporary script handling, and pipe creation suggests potential malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe batch of log events exhibits several red flags commonly associated with cyberattacks, such as suspicious file operations, registry modifications, and unusual inter-process communication. While each action could have benign explanations, their combination strongly indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. Therefore, this log data is **potentially suspicious** and warrants further investigation to identify any active threats or compromises."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the entries involve powershell.exe. That's not necessarily suspicious on its own because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. But I'll keep an eye out for anything unusual with it.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they mention 'Registry value set' tasks. Changing registry values can be part of normal system administration, but sometimes attackers use this to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is creating new files and writing content to them. For example, one event shows a command line that creates a new item in the file system and sets its content using Set-Content with \"dir\". This seems like it's creating a batch script that might execute directory listings. While this could be part of normal scripting or automated tasks, it could also be a way to create malicious scripts.\n\nI see multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing different files and registry keys. The repeated file creations in various directories (like C:\\registro_geral\\...) seem patterned, which might indicate an automated process. This repetition could suggest that something is being deployed across the system, possibly setting up multiple points of execution or persistence.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of the command line arguments with escaped quotes and paths. This is common in scripting but can sometimes be used to hide malicious commands or inject code. The exact commands here are creating batch files named things like \"modulo_secundario_script.bat\" which, when executed, run 'dir'. While running directory listings isn't inherently bad, the fact that multiple such files are being created across different directories might indicate a broader activity.\n\nAlso, some events show images being loaded, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so their loading by PowerShell is normal. But in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nOne event shows a file creation in the user's temporary directory with a PowerShell script. This might indicate that the system is testing script policy or perhaps deploying scripts that can execute at user level, which could be a precursor to more malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances creating files across various directories, writing batch scripts that run 'dir', and repeated file operations. While each action on its own might not be suspicious, the combination suggests potential malicious activity, such as script dropper or persistence mechanisms. The patterned behavior across different directories and the creation of numerous script files could be part of an attack aiming to establish multiple execution points or spread across the system.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, this batch does seem worth investigating further to rule out any malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events involving powershell.exe exhibits several red flags that warrant closer examination:\n\n1. **Multiple Registry Modifications**: Several entries show 'Registry value set' tasks. While legitimate, these could be used for persistence or configuration changes by attackers.\n\n2. **File Creation and Content Writing**: Powershell.exe is creating new files and writing content to them, such as batch scripts with commands like `Set-Content -Value \"dir\"`. This activity, especially across varied directories, suggests potential automated deployment of malicious scripts.\n\n3. **Patterned Behavior**: The repetitive creation of files in different directories (e.g., C:\\registro_geral\\...) indicates a possible broader attack vector or script dropper activity.\n\n4. **Command Line Arguments**: The use of escaped quotes and paths in command lines could be hiding malicious commands, though not conclusive on their own.\n\n5. **File Creation in Temporary Directory**: An event shows a PowerShell script created in the user's temporary directory, potentially indicating testing of script policy or deployment for execution.\n\n**Conclusion**: While individual actions may not be suspicious, the cumulative pattern suggests potential malicious activity, such as establishing persistence or spreading across the system. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these activities and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if it's interesting for investigation. The user wants me to analyze all the events together rather than each individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost every event involves powershell.exe or conhost.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it can execute scripts and has many legitimate uses, so it's a tool that requires careful monitoring.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are several File Create, File Delete, Pipe Created, Image loaded, Registry value set, and Process Create events. The files being created or deleted have paths like .bat scripts in various locations such as C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base... These paths seem arbitrary but could be indicators of script execution.\n\nThe command lines show that powershell is executing scripts with commands like New-Item, Set-Content, and Test-Path. The use of these cmdlets can be legitimate but also used for malicious scripting, such as creating files or modifying the system.\n\nI see multiple Registry value set events from powershell.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. Also, the repeated checking with Test-Path could be a sign of testing whether certain files exist before proceeding, which is common in scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThe Image loaded events are loading various DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. These are legitimate system files, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries or check for the presence of security software.\n\nThe Process Create events for conhost.exe might be a red flag because it's often used by attackers as part of their command and control mechanisms. Conhost is a Windows component that hosts console windows, and it can be滥用 abused to execute commands without being detected easily.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple powershell executions with script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, process creations, and the specific file paths involved suggest potential malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain like lateral movement, persistence, or dropping payloads.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows signs of suspicious behavior, so it's definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"The events involve multiple instances of powershell.exe and conhost.exe performing file operations, registry modifications, and process creations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and asked me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually to understand what's happening. The first few lines show powershell.exe processes with different command lines that check for the existence of specific .bat files. If the file exists, they exit with 0; otherwise, 1. This seems like a script is checking if certain files are present on the system.\n\nNext, I notice other events where powershell.exe loads DLLs from Windows Defender's platform directory. That's a bit concerning because while Defender is legitimate software, any unauthorized access to its components could be suspicious. However, in this case, it's just loading them normally, so maybe that's part of their process.\n\nThen there are file creation and deletion events for temporary PowerShell scripts like __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. The script is created but quickly deleted. This behavior could be an attempt to avoid detection by not leaving a permanent trace on the system, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is associated with log management tools like Elasticsearch. It might be legitimate if this user is setting up log monitoring, but it could also indicate someone deploying tools to collect logs for exfiltration or internal misuse.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe sets registry values and accesses processes. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious but can be part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. For example, setting registry keys might be how an attacker ensures their script runs at startup.\n\nAnother event involves the whoami.exe command being executed. This is a standard tool to check user permissions and can be benign, but in some contexts, it could be used for reconnaissance as part of an attack chain.\n\nI also see several Provider Lifecycle tasks related to powershell.exe. Providers in PowerShell handle different data types (like Registry, Alias, etc.), and their lifecycle events are normal when scripts run, especially ones that interact with system components.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances where powershell.exe is checking for specific files, creating and deleting temporary scripts, loading legitimate DLLs, accessing registry, setting values, and using whoami. These actions collectively look like they could be part of a script attempting to check if certain conditions are met (file presence) while trying to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThe file deletion after creation is a red flag because attackers often clean up traces to avoid detection. The use of multiple checks for different files across various paths might indicate an attempt to ensure the malicious payload has all necessary components, possibly part of a more extensive attack.\n\nHowever, some actions could also be legitimate, like system administration tasks or log management setups. But given the combination of behaviors—file checks, temporary script creation\/deletion, registry access, process access—it's leaning towards potentially malicious activity.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is an actual attack or just a sophisticated script for system checks, but as a cybersecurity professional, I'd err on caution and consider it suspicious. The repeated Provider Lifecycle events with powershell.exe might be part of a persistence mechanism, which is a common step in attacks to ensure the payload remains active.\n\nTherefore, while there's no direct evidence of malicious code or data exfiltration, the pattern observed is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Monitoring for similar activities, checking if these scripts are authorized, and performing a deeper analysis of the commands and registry changes would be necessary steps.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSONL events indicate a series of system activity involving `powershell.exe` processes executing checks for specific files and interacting with system components such as the Windows Defender platform, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and process access. While some actions could be legitimate, others may raise red flags, suggesting potential malicious activity.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **File Existence Checks:** Multiple `powershell.exe` instances check for specific `.bat` files using `Test-Path`. This behavior might indicate a script verifying prerequisites or attempting to ensure certain files are present before executing further actions.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Handling:** Creation and immediate deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1`) suggest efforts to avoid detection by leaving traces on the system.\n\n3. **DLL Loading from Defender Platform:** Powershell.exe loads DLLs from a directory typically associated with Windows Defender, which could be suspicious if these components are accessed without legitimate cause.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Interactions:** Modifying registry values and accessing processes using `whoami.exe` can indicate both legitimate administrative tasks or potential malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\n5. **Provider Lifecycle Events:** Repeated events related to provider lifecycle with powershell.exe may be part of a script ensuring it runs at system startup, a common technique in attacks for persistence.\n\n6. **Combined Behavior Analysis:** The combination of file checks, temporary scripts, registry modifications, and process interactions leans towards suspicious activity, potentially indicating an attack chain's early stages.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observed activities are concerning due to the pattern of behavior indicative of potential malicious intent. While not conclusive proof of an attack, the actions warrant further investigation into the origin and purpose of these processes to determine if they represent a security threat. Monitoring for similar activities and conducting deeper analysis on the scripts and registry changes would be prudent steps.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"interesting\": true,\n    \"description\": \"The JSONL events indicate suspicious system activity involving multiple checks, temporary script creation\/deletion, DLL loading, and registry modifications by powershell.exe, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm given a batch of system events from a JSONL file and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line that checks if a specific file exists in a path like \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe\". If it does, exit 0; else, exit 1. This seems like a script is checking for the presence of another executable.\n\n2. The next few events are about powershell.exe being accessed or images being loaded. These are typical when PowerShell starts up and loads various DLLs and modules. Not unusual on their own.\n\n3. There's an event where a file is created in the user's temporary folder: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. Then, immediately after, this same file is deleted. This behavior is suspicious because creating and then deleting files quickly can be a sign of malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\n4. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with similar command lines checking for different paths on the system. The commands seem repetitive but target different directories each time. This could indicate a script that's iterating through several locations to check for specific files, possibly as part of some malicious routine or a legitimate file integrity check.\n\n5. There are events where whoami.exe is run. That's a common command used by scripts to determine the user context, which can be part of privilege escalation attempts or just gathering system information.\n\n6. Lastly, there's a cmd.exe process created with a command that checks if a file exists in the temp directory and exits based on its presence. This also follows a similar pattern to the PowerShell commands, suggesting automated checks across different locations.\n\nPutting this all together, I notice several red flags:\n\n- Multiple calls to powershell.exe with specific command lines checking for files.\n- Creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell script files, which might be used to execute malicious code.\n- Use of both PowerShell and cmd.exe in a patterned manner, possibly indicating scripting or automation.\n- The repeated checks across different directories could suggest the presence of something trying to remain undetected by scattering its components.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be part of legitimate system administration tasks (like file integrity monitoring), the combination—especially the quick creation and deletion of temporary files and multiple check commands—points more towards potential malicious activity. The use of different command-line tools (PowerShell, cmd.exe) also makes it harder to detect in a single log source.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting for further investigation because the behavior doesn't align with standard user activities and could be indicative of an attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system events exhibits concerning activity that merits closer examination. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to check file existence, coupled with the creation and immediate deletion of temporary scripts, suggests potential malicious intent. These actions are inconsistent with typical user behavior and could indicate a security threat.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"interesting\",\n  \"justification\": \"The events show suspicious activity including repeated checks for specific files using PowerShell and cmd.exe, quick creation\/deletion of temp files, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, I have a batch of events from system logs that I need to analyze to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the data, most of these events are related to process creations and file loads, especially involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check for specific files using Test-Path. This seems a bit unusual because repeated checks on file existence could indicate someone trying to see if certain files exist before proceeding—maybe part of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, the use of 'whoami.exe' in some processes stands out. While it's a legitimate tool to get user information, its repeated execution might be suspicious, especially when paired with other scripts.\n\nThe command lines in PowerShell are quite long and involve complex paths. This complexity could be an attempt to obfuscate or make the commands look non-malicious. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\" and others, seem arbitrary and might not correspond to standard system directories, which raises concern.\n\nAnother point is the repeated 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe. While it's normal for processes to access certain files or registry keys, the frequency here makes me think something's off. Maybe it's part of a larger script trying to check multiple conditions before executing malicious code.\n\nLooking at the files being loaded by PowerShell, like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework, these are standard components, so they don't immediately raise flags on their own. However, combined with other activities, it could be part of loading libraries for malicious purposes.\n\nThe fact that all these events occur in a batch suggests a coordinated sequence of actions. This pattern—multiple PowerShell executions with specific checks and file loads—could be indicative of a script attempting to determine if certain files exist before carrying out an attack. It's similar to how some malware works, testing the environment for specific conditions before deploying further actions.\n\nI also notice that there are events where cmd.exe accesses the registry. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nTaking all these points together—multiple PowerShell executions with complex commands, file existence checks, arbitrary paths, repeated process access events, and registry interactions—it seems like a batch that could indicate malicious activity. While not conclusive on their own, the combination raises enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided system logs suggests a potential security concern that merits further investigation. Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions**: The logs show numerous instances of powershell.exe being executed with command lines containing complex paths and conditional checks using `Test-Path`. This behavior is unusual and could indicate an attempt to verify file existence, possibly preceding malicious actions.\n\n2. **Arbitrary File Paths**: The paths referenced in the command lines (e.g., \"C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\") are non-standard, raising suspicion as they might be crafted to avoid detection or mislead analysis.\n\n3. **Repeated Process Access**: The frequent 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe could suggest a script attempting multiple checks before executing potentially harmful code.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications by cmd.exe**: These events may relate to persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation, which are common in malware activities.\n\n5. **Use of whoami.exe**: While legitimate, its repeated use alongside other scripts could be part of an attempt to gather system information for malicious purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of these factors indicates a batch of logs that should be closely examined as they may signal a coordinated attack or malicious script execution. Further investigation is recommended to determine if any unauthorized activities have occurred."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event shows that powershell.exe loaded an image, specifically MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal because defender uses these DLLs, so nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nNext, there's a file creation event by powershell.exe in the user's Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. This might be part of some script checking or testing permissions, but it's worth noting because creating and then deleting files quickly can sometimes be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe checks if certain paths exist using Test-Path cmdlet in the command line. Each time it exits with 0 if the path exists, else 1. This repeated checking could indicate that the script is probing for specific files or directories, which might be part of a larger malicious routine like trying to locate valuable data or ensuring necessary components are present.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run. That's another red flag because it can be used to gather system information, potentially for reconnaissance before more serious attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets by powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations, which is concerning if not authorized.\n\nConsidering all these events together, I notice a pattern: repeated PowerShell activity with file operations, registry changes, process access, and external tool execution (whoami). These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior. The repeated checks for specific files could be indicative of attempting to execute malicious scripts or exfiltration attempts.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some actions might be legitimate, the combination—especially the file creation\/deletion and multiple registry modifications—is concerning. This batch shows a potential attack vector, possibly involving script execution and system configuration changes that are often seen in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations, registry modifications, and process access, which may indicate malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that most of them involve powershell.exe. There's a pattern here: multiple ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs. That could be normal for PowerShell running scripts, but it's worth noting how many there are and what they're accessing.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created and immediately deleted by powershell.exe. The file path includes 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', which sounds suspicious because that script name suggests it might be designed to capture keystrokes, a common tactic in malware for keylogging.\n\nAnother thing I see is the creation of a PowerShell profile data file, which could indicate persistence mechanisms or storing configuration information. Malware often uses such techniques to maintain access across reboots or user sessions.\n\nThere's also a Registry value being set by powershell.exe, which might be part of establishing persistence or making changes to system configurations that are hard to detect without logs.\n\nOn the other hand, there are benign events like notepad.exe and calc.exe accessing urlmon.dll, which is standard for their operations. The whoami.exe execution isn't unusual on its own but could be part of a larger script's process enumeration.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes loading various DLLs, creating and deleting a potentially malicious script file, setting registry values—all these points add up to something that stands out as potentially malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion of a potentially malicious script and multiple DLL loads, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That sounds normal because winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for logging, so it might be setting up its configuration file.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate admin tasks and by attackers, so this could be something to look into. The command lines here don't immediately show malicious activity, but repeated use might warrant attention.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe running, which again is a standard tool for checking user permissions. No red flags there unless it's being used in an unexpected way.\n\nThe events where chrome.exe connects to the network and performs DNS queries are pretty typical user activity. Browsing would naturally involve these actions, so I don't think that's concerning on its own.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values and loading various DLLs. This is where things might get interesting. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The specific paths like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc., are standard for .NET framework components, but seeing multiple ImageLoad events could indicate that PowerShell is executing scripts or loading modules in a way that's worth investigating.\n\nThe repeated NetworkConnect and DnsQuery tasks from chrome.exe don't seem suspicious, just normal internet usage. However, the combination of powershell.exe accessing the registry and loading numerous DLLs might suggest script execution or module loading, which could be part of malicious activities like lateral movement or installing backdoors.\n\nI also notice that some events have command lines for PowerShell scripts. For example, \"& {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}\". This looks like it's invoking a script that lists files recursively, which in itself isn't bad but could be part of data gathering by an attacker.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while individually many events are benign, the pattern of PowerShell accessing the registry and loading multiple modules stands out. It's possible that this is part of legitimate admin tasks, but given the frequency and the specific actions, it might indicate malicious behavior or at least warrant further investigation to ensure nothing is amiss.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, I would classify this batch as INTERESTING because there are potential indicators of compromise involving PowerShell activity, which often is a vector for attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values and loading various DLLs, which may indicate malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is creating and deleting files. For example, the first two events show 'File created' and then 'File Delete logged'. This could be normal activity, but it's worth noting because PowerShell scripts can sometimes be used maliciously.\n\nThen, I see several events where powershell.exe is running commands like ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, and gci -recurse. These are directory listing commands, so that seems benign on its own, but repeated usage might indicate something more. Also, the same command line appears multiple times across different entries, which could suggest a script or automated process running these commands.\n\nLooking at other events, there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which I think is related to log shipping or monitoring tools. That seems legitimate and probably not suspicious unless it's doing something unusual.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That makes sense because Defender might use PowerShell for some scans or actions, so that's likely okay.\n\nAnother point of interest is the registry value set events by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate software installations, but they can also be malicious. Since it's paired with other PowerShell activities, I'm leaning towards this being more suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where the task in winlog is 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These might be internal events from the logging system itself, perhaps related to how the logs are processed and managed.\n\nPutting it all together, while some of these events on their own aren't necessarily bad, the combination raises flags. The repeated PowerShell commands accessing files and registry, along with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, could indicate script testing or lateral movement during an attack. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing commands and modifying system files and registry suggest potential malicious activities such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
