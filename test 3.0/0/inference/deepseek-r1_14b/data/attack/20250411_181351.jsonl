{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously, so that raises some flags. The commands seem to involve taking screenshots using System.Windows.Forms, which could indicate data exfiltration or surveillance activities.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is creating processes and accessing registry values. That's concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools to hide their tracks and maintain persistence. The repeated process creations and the specific command lines suggest a possible script running multiple times, maybe trying different approaches to capture screen data.\n\nThere are also events where files are being saved into the TEMP directory with names like unidade_logico.png or tarefa_comum.png. This pattern of saving images in TEMP might be part of an attempt to collect sensitive information without leaving obvious traces elsewhere.\n\nConsidering the variety and frequency of powershell.exe activities, including multiple process creations and file operations, it seems suspicious. The use of System.Windows.Forms for screen capturing is a red flag because it's not a typical legitimate activity for Powershell scripts unless explicitly authorized.\n\nMoreover, the events show that these processes are accessing various system files and registry entries, which could be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement within a network. The consistent command lines across different events suggest a script being executed multiple times, possibly attempting to avoid detection by varying filenames or parameters.\n\nIn summary, the combination of powershell.exe usage with screen capturing, file operations in TEMP, and repeated process creations points towards potential malicious activity. While there's no concrete evidence here, the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts that capture screenshots and interact with system files and registry, indicating possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that seem to involve capturing the screen and saving it as a PNG file in the TEMP directory. The commands use System.Windows.Forms and create bitmaps of the virtual screen. This kind of activity could be part of legitimate screenshot utilities or malware trying to capture sensitive information. Since there are several similar events, each time saving different files like 'estrutura_ativo.png', 'modulo_principal.png', etc., it's a bit concerning because repeated screen captures without clear justification might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThen, I notice that powershell.exe is creating and then deleting a file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1'. The creation and subsequent deletion of files by scripts can be a sign of script injection or testing the system's policies. Malware often tries to test if certain actions are allowed by creating temporary files and then removing them if things go wrong.\n\nLooking further, there are events related to pipes being created by powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but in the context of malicious activities, they can be a way to create hidden channels of communication or to escalate privileges.\n\nThere's also an event where 'Execute a Remote Command' is logged twice. This task indicates that some remote execution might have occurred, which could be part of legitimate administration tasks or could be indicative of command-and-control (C2) activity, where malware communicates with its controller.\n\nAnother point is the file creation by winlogbeat.exe in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting Windows logs, so this might be normal if it's running as intended. However, it's worth checking if the configuration file was created without any issues or if there were unauthorized changes.\n\nThe events where various executables like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and others are accessing registry values could be part of their normal operation. However, frequent writes to the registry might suggest that something is attempting to modify system configurations, which could be malicious in nature.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe accessing another process (ProcessAccess rule) might indicate some form of process injection or monitoring. This could be a red flag if not explained by legitimate activity, such as debugging tools or scripts run by the user.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated use of powershell for screen captures and file operations, remote command execution, pipe creation, and registry modifications across multiple processes. These activities collectively raise suspicions of potential malicious behavior. While some might be part of normal system operations, the combination and frequency could indicate an attack vector or data exfiltration attempt.\n\nI should also consider the user's environment: is this a standard activity for their usual software? If powershell scripts are commonly used, maybe not, but the volume here seems high. The fact that multiple different executables (powershell.exe, conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe) are involved in these events without clear correlation might suggest they're part of a coordinated attack or lateral movement within a network.\n\nAnother thing to check would be timestamps on these eventsâ€”are they occurring closely together? If so, it could indicate a burst of activity that's suspicious. Also, looking at the source IP addresses for any remote commands could help determine if it's internal or external traffic.\n\nIn conclusion, while each event might not individually signify an immediate threat, the combination points towards potential malicious activities. It would be prudent to investigate these logs further, possibly deploying additional monitoring tools or conducting a more thorough security audit.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several concerning activities that collectively suggest potential malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Powershell Activity**:\n   - Multiple instances of powershell.exe capturing the screen and saving images in TEMP suggests possible screenshotting, which could be malware attempting to gather sensitive information.\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - Creation and deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1' by powershell.exe indicates potential script injection or policy testing, often a sign of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - Pipes created by powershell.exe and chrome.exe could be used for inter-process communication, potentially indicating hidden channels for malicious activities like privilege escalation.\n\n4. **Remote Command Execution**:\n   - Events logging 'Execute a Remote Command' suggest possible command-and-control (C2) activity, where malware communicates with its controller.\n\n5. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Frequent registry writes by various processes, including Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe, could indicate system configuration tampering, often seen in malware.\n\n6. **Process Access**:\n   - Powershell accessing another process might suggest process injection or monitoring, which is suspicious unless justified by legitimate activity.\n\n7. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - Creation of a config file by winlogbeat.exe needs verification to ensure it's part of intended log collection and not unauthorized access.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of powershell use for screen captures, file operations, remote commands, pipes, and registry modifications across multiple processes raises suspicions of malicious activity. Further investigation is recommended, including checking event timestamps, source IPs, and system configurations to assess potential threats."}

So, the user has given a batch of system logs in JSONL format and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, I notice that most of them are from chrome.exe performing various tasks. The tasks include setting registry values, making DNS queries, and loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. \n\nHmm, these activities seem pretty normal for a browser process. Browsers do interact with registries to store settings, perform DNS lookups to resolve domain names, and load system DLLs as part of their operation. I don't see any signs of unusual behavior here.\n\nAlso, all events are from the same process, chrome.exe, which is legitimate software. No evidence of known malicious processes or actions that stand out. \n\nSo, putting it all together, there's nothing in this batch that raises red flags.
