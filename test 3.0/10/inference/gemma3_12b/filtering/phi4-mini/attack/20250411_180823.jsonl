This pattern, combined with PowerShell process access and registry events, strongly suggests potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence through scheduled tasks. Furthermore, the names of the tasks use a common naming convention (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon', 'pacote_comum_005_OnStartup') which may indicate a coordinated effort.  Although `calc.exe` is involved, it's potentially a decoy or part of a larger payload.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
