Specifically, several PowerShell processes are manipulating file timestamps, which is often a tactic used by attackers to evade detection or obscure file modification times.  Additionally, there's a significant number of 'Registry value set' events, which, while common, require closer inspection given the other suspicious activity. The frequent 'chrome.exe' registry modifications and image loads are also warrant further scrutiny, as they could indicate browser-based malware or extensions.
