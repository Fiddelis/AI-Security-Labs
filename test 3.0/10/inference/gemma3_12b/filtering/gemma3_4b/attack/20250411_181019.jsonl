Multiple attempts to start a PowerShell script from the command line, attempts to create windows services, and the repeated registry events across multiple processes raise concerns about potential malicious activity, specifically related to script execution or persistence mechanisms. The repeated registry events also could be a result of an anomaly or attempted obfuscation. The URLMon.dll load from Calculator and the frequent PowerShell activity also contributes to this classification.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
