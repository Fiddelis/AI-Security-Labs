This pattern is strongly indicative of potential malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized privilege escalation. The consistent use of scheduled tasks, coupled with the inclusion of multiple similar events with slightly different task names, raises suspicion. Additionally, multiple .NET framework DLLs are loaded by PowerShell, which can be associated with malware execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
