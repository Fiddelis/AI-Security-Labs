The presence of temporary files and the pattern of encoding\/decoding suggest potential malicious behavior such as obfuscation or downloading and executing malicious code. The `SDXHelper.exe` and URLMon activity also merit investigation. The repeated registry modifications and chrome activity could be related to persistence or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
