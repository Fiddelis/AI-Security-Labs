The attempted creation of a service named 'win32times' and subsequent deletion is a strong indicator of potential malicious intent. While some events appear normal (e.g., Chrome, winlogbeat), the combination of PowerShell, scheduled task creation, and registry events warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
