{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used for malicious activities, but sometimes legitimate too. Looking at the command lines, I don't immediately see anything suspicious in the provided events, but that doesn't mean there isn't something hidden.\n\nI notice cmd.exe and schtasks.exe being used with commands to create scheduled tasks. Specifically, they're creating a task called win32times which runs powershell scripts. The script paths mentioned are NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Since the filenames don't exist, that's concerning because it might mean the script is not being loaded from there or it's trying to execute something malicious at runtime.\n\nThere are several registry events where values are being set. This is common in malware for persistence mechanisms. Registry modifications can allow attackers to maintain access to a system even after rebooting. The fact that svchost.exe and other processes are making registry changes is suspicious because svchost is often associated with legitimate services, but it can also be used by malware.\n\nAlso, there are multiple file creation events related to creating tasks in the Windows directory (like C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times). This could indicate that malicious code is attempting to schedule persistent tasks or modify system files.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of chrome.exe making registry changes. While Chrome can make some registry entries, excessive writes without clear justification might be a sign of tampering or malware activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are two instances where powershell.exe creates files named estrutura_geral.txt and entrada_ativo.txt in user downloads. Without knowing what these scripts do, but given the other indicators, it's possible they're being used for malicious purposes like data exfiltration or storing configuration information.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe is another red flag. While legitimate tools might use it to check permissions, its presence alongside other suspicious activities could indicate an attempt to gather system information.\n\nOverall, combining all these events—use of powershell and cmd to create scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts, multiple registry modifications by various processes, file creation in system directories, and the repeated execution of potentially malicious tools—the batch shows signs of potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some actions could be legitimate, but there are enough indicators to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch indicates suspicious activities such as multiple attempts to create scheduled tasks using non-existing scripts, registry modifications by various processes including svchost.exe and cmd.exe, and file creation in system directories. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
