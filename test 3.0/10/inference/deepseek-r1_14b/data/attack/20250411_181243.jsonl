{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessed. That's interesting because while PowerShell is a legitimate tool for system admins, it's also commonly used in attacks. The first event shows powershell.exe accessing something with the ProcessAccess rule, which means it's opening another file or process.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe creates new processes. One of them even has a command line that includes several commands like net user, get-localuser, and others. These commands seem to be gathering information about users and groups on the system. That could be part of recon for an attack.\n\nLooking further, I notice registry value sets. This suggests that the script might be making changes to the system's registry, which is a common tactic in persistence mechanisms. Malware often uses the registry to maintain settings or ensure it runs at boot.\n\nThere are also file creation and deletion events in the logs. PowerShell created a temporary .ps1 file and then immediately deleted it. This behavior is suspicious because attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting scripts after execution. The fact that the file was named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" might be an attempt to blend in with legitimate Windows processes, but it's still unusual.\n\nThe later events show a command line with multiple commands executed through powershell.exe. These include net user for listing users, get-localgroupmember for getting group members, cmdkey.exe for managing cached credentials, and others that list directories and files. This seems like an attacker is trying to gather as much information as possible about the system.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and information-gathering commands points towards potential malicious activity. The events seem to be part of a script that's probing the system for vulnerabilities or sensitive data, which is a red flag for an attack.\n\nSo, I think this batch is definitely interesting because it shows signs of possible exploitation or unauthorized access. The confidence level isn't 100% since some of these actions could be from legitimate scripts, but the combination of behaviors is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and information-gathering commands indicative of reconnaissance or attack activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell being executed with command lines that include various commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', and others. These commands often relate to querying user information, group memberships, and directory listings, which can be legitimate but could also indicate reconnaissance activities.\n\nThere's also a command that runs 'cmdkey.exe \/list', which is used to list cached credentials. That's a red flag because attackers might use this to gather sensitive information like saved passwords or domain credentials.\n\nI see several instances where processes are created for net.exe, net1.exe, and cmdkey.exe, all executed from system32. This could be part of an attempt to gather network user information or system details, which is a common tactic in early stages of an attack.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity involving creating files and accessing the registry. The file creation by PowerShell might be to store data locally, possibly for later use or exfiltration. Registry modifications could indicate attempts to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple repeated commands and process creations, which might suggest a script running several commands in sequence. This kind of repetitive behavior is often seen in automated attacks or tools used by attackers.\n\nThe presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file named '.winlogbeat.yml.new' seems like it could be related to log management, but without more context, I can't rule out if this is part of the malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using PowerShell for command execution, querying user and group information, listing credentials, and modifying system configurations suggests potential malicious behavior. These actions are indicative of an attacker performing reconnaissance and possibly setting up persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell command execution with potentially malicious intent, including user enumeration, credential dumping, and file creation activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **RuntimeBroker.exe** set a registry value. That seems normal since Runtime Broker is part of Windows and often deals with user runtime operations.\n   \n2. **Powershell.exe** setting a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused by attackers. However, without more context on what was changed, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\n3. Powershell again accessing something. Again, could be benign or suspicious depending on the details.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat.exe** created a file in its own directory for configuration. This looks legitimate; Winlogbeat is an ELK component used for log shipping.\n\n5. **Notepad.exe** setting a registry value. Notepad is a simple text editor and typically shouldn't be modifying system settings, unless the user intentionally does so via scripts or commands.\n\n6. Another Powershell access event, similar to point 2.\n\n7. **Calc.exe** loaded urlmon.dll. That's odd because Calculator usually doesn't load DLLs related to URL handling. Malware might inject code into legitimate processes like calc.exe, and urlmon is often used for loading resources from the internet.\n\n8 & 9. **Svchost.exe** setting registry values again. Svchost is a common process that hosts various system services. Seeing it modify the registry isn't unusual but could be concerning if there are multiple instances or specific keys being modified.\n\n10. **Calculator.exe** loaded urlmon.dll again. This repetition with another legitimate-looking process makes me more suspicious. It might indicate a pattern of malicious activity using common tools.\n\n11. **Whoami.exe** was executed, which shows user information. Alone, it's not concerning unless there are other factors like unusual timing or volume.\n\n12. Powershell access again, reinforcing the earlier points about its usage.\n\nPutting this together: Multiple instances of registry modifications by non-standard processes (Notepad, Calculator) loading unexpected DLLs (urlmon). Especially since urlmon is related to URL handling and could be used for downloading files or executing commands remotely. The repeated use of Powershell accessing things might indicate persistence mechanisms or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the combination of registry changes, process injection into legitimate apps, and multiple Powershell accesses suggests possible malicious activity. However, it's not conclusive without more context, so my confidence is around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show unusual registry modifications and process activities involving potentially malicious tools like powershell.exe and calc.exe loading unexpected DLLs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
