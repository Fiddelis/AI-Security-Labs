{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That doesn't seem too unusual because Chrome does a lot of network activity, especially if you're browsing the web.\n\nThen I notice some entries from RuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values. Runtime Broker is a Windows process that's part of User Account Control (UAC), so it's normal for it to interact with the registry.\n\nThere's also an event from notepad.exe modifying the registry. Notepad is a simple text editor, but it can access the registry if you're working on scripts or configuration files, though this might be a bit odd but not necessarily malicious yet.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers for its scripting capabilities. The command line here doesn't immediately show any suspicious activity, just accessing the process, so maybe nothing to worry about yet.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from cmd.exe with a long command line. It looks like it's creating scheduled tasks using schtasks. The task names have \"_005_\" in them, which might be part of some naming convention, but the actual commands being run are calc.exe, which is just the calculator. That seems odd because why would you schedule the calculator to run on startup or logon? It doesn't make much sense unless there's a legitimate reason, but it could also be a way for malware to establish persistence.\n\nThere are multiple instances of schtasks.exe creating tasks that execute calc.exe with different names like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\". This repetition and the use of cmd.exe with specific commands might indicate scripting or automated task creation. It's possible this is part of some legitimate setup script, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity trying to hide under normal processes.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that svchost.exe, which is a common host process for services, is modifying registry values and creating files in the Task directory. Svchost can run various services, so this isn't inherently suspicious. However, multiple registry writes and file creations by svchost might be worth looking into if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nThere are events from Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL for handling URL moniker parsing. This seems normal unless it's being used in an unexpected way. Similarly, schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll is expected since that's the task scheduler's main DLL.\n\nPutting this all together, the key points are:\n\n1. Multiple scheduled tasks created using schtasks.exe with cmd.exe commands to run calc.exe.\n2. The use of different task names and persistence mechanisms (onlogon, onstart).\n3. svchost.exe creating files in the Task directory, which might be related to these tasks or other services.\n\nWhile individual events aren't suspicious, the combination raises a red flag. Creating multiple scheduled tasks that run calc.exe could be an attempt to establish persistence or part of a larger attack chain. Additionally, the varied task names and use of different triggers (onstart vs onlogon) might be trying to avoid detection or ensure execution at different times.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities align with known TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures) used by attackers. For example, using scheduled tasks to execute arbitrary commands is a common persistence method in malware. The use of cmd.exe as part of the task command could be obfuscating malicious activity under a normal process.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no smoking gun here, the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with calc.exe and the involvement of svchost.exe in file creation might indicate potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation. It would be wise to check each task's legitimacy, review the file operations by svchost.exe, and ensure that all processes are authorized and not part of a compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity deserving of further investigation. Key points of concern include:\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation:** Multiple tasks created via schtasks.exe with cmd.exe commands to run calc.exe, using different task names and triggers (onstart, onlogon). This could indicate an attempt at persistence or part of a larger attack chain.\n\n2. **svchost.exe Activity:** svchost.exe creating files in the Task directory, which might be related to the scheduled tasks or other services. While svchost is typically benign, multiple file creations could warrant scrutiny.\n\n3. **PowerShell and cmd.exe Usage:** Although not overtly malicious in this context, the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for task creation is a common technique in malware for obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile individual events may not be suspicious, their combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity. It is recommended to:\n\n- Verify the legitimacy of each scheduled task.\n- Investigate svchost.exe file operations for unauthorized activities.\n- Assess whether these processes align with known attack TTPs.\n\nThis thorough review will help determine if the system has been compromised or if this activity is part of a legitimate process."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe all showing registry value set tasks. That seems a bit unusual because these are common system processes, but seeing them making changes to the registry could be normal or it could indicate malicious activity, depending on what exactly they're doing.\n\nThen there's a lot of events from chrome.exe with RegistryEvent tasks. Chrome is a legitimate application, so why would it be setting so many registry values? That might not be too suspicious on its own, but the sheer number (like 14 times) could raise an eyebrow. Maybe it's part of some update or configuration process, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking further down, there's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That seems related to their logging setup, so probably nothing wrong there unless it's unexpected in that location.\n\nAnother important point is the powershell.exe events. One of them creates a file called unidade_ativo.txt. Powershell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Creating files can be part of normal scripting, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple ProcessAccess tasks related to powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Process access events usually mean another process is interacting with it. If a script or another application is accessing these processes, it could be indicative of some malicious activity trying to hide itself or inject code into legitimate processes.\n\nAlso, there's an event from whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is typically used to get user information and isn't inherently malicious, but seeing it in the logs might not add much unless it's part of a larger sequence of events.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of processes modifying the registry, powershell.exe creating files, and process access events could indicate that something is trying to hide or alter system behavior. The high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe is also concerning because it's not typical for a browser to make so many changes, especially if they're happening in quick succession.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags: unusual file creation by powershell, multiple process access events, and excessive registry modifications. These could be signs of malicious activity, though it's not conclusive without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected includingregistry modifications by non-standard processes, file creation by PowerShell, and process access events which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
