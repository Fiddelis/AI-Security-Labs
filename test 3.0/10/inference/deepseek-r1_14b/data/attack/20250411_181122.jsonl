Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, there's a whoami.exe running. That seems normal because it's often used to check user permissions, so probably not malicious on its own.\n\nThen, there are multiple powershell.exe processes with different tasks. Some are creating files and others are accessing the registry or loading images. The command line in one of them catches my eye: it's using findstr and select-string with a pattern looking for 'password'. That sounds suspicious because searching for passwords could be part of data theft.\n\nAlso, there are several events where powershell.exe is being monitored with 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. I'm not sure what that exactly means, but repeated process creations might indicate something's off.\n\nI notice powershell creating a temporary script file and then deleting it shortly after. This behavior is common in attacks to avoid detection by leaving fewer traces. The deletion of the file could be an attempt to cover their tracks.\n\nLooking at other events: notepad.exe accessing the registry, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll—those seem less concerning. The winlogbeat process creating a config file is likely just part of logging setup.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated powershell activity with password searches and file deletions stands out. It's possible that an attacker is using powershell to search for sensitive information across files, which could be malicious.

This could indicate password extraction attempts, which is suspicious.\n\nNext, several svchost.exe processes modifying the registry might be part of a persistence mechanism or malicious activity trying to hide itself.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal but worth noting as it's unusual for such an innocent process to load this DLL.\n\nConhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe also modifying the registry could be part of a broader attack, possibly using legitimate processes for malicious tasks.\n\nChrome.exe making many registry changes and DNS queries might just be regular activity, but the volume is high. Could indicate something like ad injection or tracking.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a file looks benign, perhaps from an ELK stack setup, so probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nConsidering all these points together, especially the PowerShell command lines with password searches and the registry modifications, I think this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines searching for 'pass' in various file types, indicating potential password extraction attempts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. The goal is to analyze the entire set together rather than individual events.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events are coming from 'chrome.exe', which isn't unusual since Chrome is a common application with many activities. There's a lot of 'Registry value set' and 'Network connection detected' tasks here. While some registry access can be normal for applications, especially browsers, the sheer number might raise an eyebrow but not necessarily red flags on their own.\n\nThen there are events from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. Actions like creating files, accessing processes, and modifying the registry with PowerShell could indicate script execution or lateral movement in an attack. For example, creating files named '.txt' but possibly containing malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at other processes: 'winlogbeat.exe' is likely related to log management, so file creation events here might be part of normal data collection. However, the repeated attempts to delete scheduled tasks using 'cmd.exe' and 'schtasks.exe' are concerning. This behavior can indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or disrupt system monitoring.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' execution which is often used to check user permissions. While benign on its own, it could be part of privilege escalation in an attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple instances of process creation for potentially malicious tools (Powershell, cmd), attempts to delete scheduled tasks (possibly removing traces or persistence), and registry modifications that could be part of persistence mechanisms. This combination suggests possible adversary activity, such as establishing a presence, deleting logs to cover tracks, or preparing for further actions.\n\nThe confidence level is high because several red flags are present collectively, even if individually they might not be alarming. The pattern of behaviors points towards potential malicious intent rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including registry modifications, network connections, and deletion of scheduled tasks, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving process creations and deletions. For example, 'schtasks.exe' is being used with the command line '\/delete \/tn \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\" \/f', which suggests someone is trying to delete a scheduled task. That's a bit concerning because deleting tasks can be part of malicious activities like removing traces or disabling security features.\n\nThen, there are several instances where 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' are being executed with command lines that include various operations. For example, one cmd.exe command is '\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete >nul 2>&1'. This looks like an attempt to delete Notepad processes, which could be part of a script trying to remove evidence or terminate legitimate tools used by defenders.\n\nI also see multiple events involving 'WMIC.exe', which is often used in command-line attacks. WMIC can be dangerous because it allows remote commands and can be exploited for malicious purposes. The fact that it's loading various DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll might indicate some form of obfuscation or attempt to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times. While this could be legitimate, in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be used to gather information about user accounts, which is often part of reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nThere are several registry-related events too. Processes like 'svchost.exe', 'cmd.exe', and others are accessing or modifying the registry. This could be part of persistence mechanisms where attackers set up registry entries to ensure their malicious activities persist across reboots.\n\nI also notice commands like '\/del \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\"' and similar, which seem to be deleting user accounts. If these aren't authorized actions, they might indicate an attacker trying to remove user accounts as part of privilege escalation or cleanup after compromising a system.\n\nThe repeated use of 'powershell.exe' with registry modifications is another red flag. PowerShell is powerful but often used by attackers for execution and persistence. The fact that it's accessing processes and modifying the registry could be signs of malicious scripting.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they don't seem to fit typical user activities. Instead, they show a series of actions that might be part of an attack chain: deleting tasks, terminating processes, modifying the registry, deleting users, and using tools like WMIC and PowerShell. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these events are from a legitimate script or administrative activity. But given the variety of suspicious actions and their repetition, the risk that this is an attack increases significantly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of process deletions, command-line tools usage, registry modifications, and user account deletions points to potential malicious activities. It's definitely worth investigating further to ensure there's no ongoing compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits a series of actions that raise suspicions of potential malicious activity. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Process Deletions**: Use of 'schtasks.exe' to delete scheduled tasks, which could be part of removing traces or disabling security features.\n2. **Command-Line Tools**: Execution of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' with commands like terminating Notepad processes, indicative of possible evidence removal or termination of defender tools.\n3. **WMIC Usage**: Multiple instances of 'WMIC.exe' loading DLLs, which may be used for obfuscation or attack mechanisms.\n4. **User Account Modifications**: Commands deleting user accounts, possibly unauthorized actions for privilege escalation or cleanup.\n5. **Registry Access**: Processes accessing the registry, potentially for persistence mechanisms.\n\nThese activities collectively suggest a possible attack chain involving process termination, registry modifications, and account deletions. While it's possible these events are from legitimate scripts, the combination strongly indicates potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe. These are common system utilities, so on their own, their execution isn't unusual.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field, I see a lot of Registry-related events: 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted'. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate software installation or updates, but they can also indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms. However, these are happening from various processes which might just be normal system operations.\n\nThere's also 'Process Create' events for several executables. For example, cmd.exe creating new processes with command lines that delete users and services. The command_line fields show commands like \"net user ... \/del \/domain\" and \"sc delete win32times\". These commands are used to delete user accounts and services, which could be part of legitimate system administration but might also signal an attacker trying to remove traces or disable monitoring.\n\nAdditionally, the use of powershell.exe multiple times with 'Process accessed' events could indicate script execution. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators, but it's also commonly exploited for malicious activities like executing scripts or downloading payloads.\n\nThe repeated Registry modifications across different processes make me cautious. Attackers might be trying to create persistent backdoors or modify system configurations to maintain access. The deletion of user accounts and services could be an attempt to erase logs or disable security features.\n\nConsidering the combination, while individual events might not raise red flags, the pattern of multiple process creations with specific commands, repeated Registry modifications, and use of PowerShell collectively suggest potential malicious activity. This batch shows a sequence that could indicate an attack chain—enumeration, privilege escalation, persistence, and cleanup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as user deletion, service removal, and registry modifications, which may suggest unauthorized system changes or attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSON events related to processes and system activities on a Windows machine.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where cmd.exe is being used with commands like deleting files in the temp directory. That's a bit concerning because attackers often delete log files to cover their tracks. Also, using cmd.exe to execute such commands could be part of malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. PowerShell is powerful and commonly abused by attackers for executing scripts and lateral movement. The logs show multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes, writes to the registry, and loads various DLLs. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when combined with other events, they might indicate something suspicious.\n\nI also see that some PowerShell commands are executed via command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems a bit odd. It makes me think of potential code injection or script execution techniques used in attacks. Additionally, there are file creation and deletion events involving temporary files, which could be part of dropping malicious payloads or cleaning up traces.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of Registry value set tasks by both cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, so this repetitive activity stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe was run, which could be used to gather information about the current user, possibly for privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering all these events together—using cmd.exe to delete files, extensive PowerShell usage with registry modifications, file operations in temp directories, and odd command-line executions—it paints a picture of potential malicious activity. The combination suggests someone is trying to execute commands, modify system settings, and possibly clean up after themselves, which is typical of an attacker's behavior.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these activities are part of legitimate scripts or automated processes. To be certain, more context would be needed, such as the user account running these processes, timestamps, and whether these actions are part of a known system routine. But based solely on the events provided, the indicators point towards something suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the pattern of activities is indicative of potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't very high (maybe around 0.6) since some of these could be legitimate, but the overall combination raises enough red flags to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of cmd.exe and powershell.exe performing potentially malicious activities such as deleting files in temp directories, modifying the registry, and executing unusual commands.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe creating a pipe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused by attackers. So that could be suspicious, but it's not enough on its own.\n\nSecond event: another powershell.exe with an ampersand in the command line. That might indicate chaining commands, which is common in scripts. Not sure yet if it's bad.\n\nThird event: powershell loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender directory. defender services often load various DLLs, so this seems normal unless the file is malicious.\n\nFourth: powershell creates a file in the StartupProfileData folder for non-interactive use. That might be setting up some startup script, but without knowing what's inside, it's hard to tell.\n\nFifth: Registry value set by powershell. Attackers sometimes modify registry settings to persistence or change system configurations, so this could be a red flag.\n\nNext few events are conhost.exe and whoami.exe being run. Conhost is often used with PowerShell for interaction, and whoami is typically benign but can be part of info-gathering.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data folder. That seems like it's related to log management, probably setup by an admin or security tool.\n\nAfter that, multiple events show powershell accessing processes (ProcessAccess task). This could mean it's interacting with other processes, which is possible for legitimate scripts but might be a sign of lateral movement if done inappropriately.\n\nThere are several instances of whoami.exe being executed. It's a common command to check user info, so unless there's an unusual volume or execution context, this isn't concerning on its own.\n\nOther events include RuntimeBroker, notepad, calc, and svchost modifying registry entries. These are all standard processes, but any modifications could be part of malicious activities, though they're also common in legitimate operations.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there's a lot of powershell activity with various actions like creating files, accessing registries, and interacting with other processes. While some of these actions individually aren't alarming, the combination might raise eyebrows. The repeated use of whoami.exe and process access could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation. Also, the creation of startup scripts by powershell is a classic technique for persistence.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or specific command lines that are malicious, it's hard to be certain.

That's probably normal since it's part of the log collection process, maybe updating or creating config files.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessed something. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. But without more context, like what exactly was done, it's hard to say.\n\nThen, whoami.exe ran. That's usually just a simple command to show user info, which is common and not suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access event. Maybe the same script or process as before, so maybe nothing wrong here unless combined with other events.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both set registry values. ApplicationFrameHost is part of Windows for app containers, Calculator is a regular system tool; these actions are normal and not concerning.\n\nThe next few events all involve chrome.exe: multiple DNS queries and network connections. Chrome doing DNS lookups is expected as it loads pages. The number seems high but could be due to extensive browsing or background updates. Not inherently suspicious unless pointing to known malicious domains, which isn't indicated here.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, most events are standard user activities—browsing, system tools running, log file updates.
