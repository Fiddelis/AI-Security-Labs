{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and a DNS query. That might be normal since Chrome does make a lot of network requests, but it's worth noting the number of network connections detected—there are five of those. Then, moving on to powershell.exe, I see a few different tasks.\n\nOne event shows that powershell.exe is setting a registry value, which could be part of legitimate administration or it might be something malicious modifying system configurations. Next, there's a command line parameter in the process event where Powershell is executing some code. The command uses New-Object System.Net.WebClient to download files from various GitHub repositories into the user's TEMP directory.\n\nLooking closer at these downloads:\n- The first file is LICENSE.txt from a repository named \"modulo_temporario\/modulo_ativo\".\n- Then, similar patterns follow with different repository names like \"unidade_base\/componente_base\" and others, each time downloading LICENSE.txt to temporary files in the TEMP directory.\n  \nAfter each download, there's an event where Powershell creates a file and then deletes it. This seems suspicious because deleting scripts after execution is a common tactic by attackers to cover their tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs which could be part of normal operations but might also indicate the use of some framework or library for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting this all together: Powershell downloading files from GitHub and immediately deleting them after execution is a red flag. These activities could be indicative of a script being executed to perform tasks on the system without proper authorization, possibly installing malware or other harmful software. The repeated attempts to download from different repositories might suggest an attempt to avoid detection by varying the source each time.\n\nMoreover, the fact that these are multiple events with similar patterns but slightly different command lines and file paths makes me think this isn't just a one-time script execution but part of a larger process or loop where files are being downloaded and executed in sequence. This kind of behavior is often seen in command-line attacks where attackers test multiple sources to ensure their malicious code runs without interruption.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these downloads are legitimate, perhaps for some automated task or script. However, given the combination of downloading from GitHub (which can be a vector for malicious scripts), the use of Powershell with WebClient, and immediate file deletion upon download, it's more likely than not to be malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation as it exhibits multiple signs that could indicate unauthorized or malicious activities on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories and immediately deleting them, which is indicative of potential malicious activity attempting to avoid detection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where PowerShell is being used with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. For example, the commands are using WebClient to download LICENSE.txt files into temporary directories. This stands out because downloading files from external sources can be a common tactic in malicious activities, especially if they're landing in temp folders which are often used for short-term storage of malicious payloads.\n\nNext, I see that there are multiple events where Chrome.exe is setting registry values. While Chrome does make changes to the registry when it runs, doing this repeatedly might indicate something unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are several FileCreate and RegistryEvent tasks from various processes like powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and others. The file paths created by powershell.exe point to different locations, including the Downloads folder and temporary directories. This could be part of legitimate operations, but considering the combination with the downloads from GitHub, it raises an eyebrow.\n\nI also notice that some events involve MpDefenderCoreService.exe detecting a network connection. That's a bit concerning because if this process is associated with defender services, unexpected network activity might indicate it's being manipulated by something malicious trying to communicate.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that download files from different GitHub repositories. The fact that each download is for LICENSE.txt could be an attempt to make it look less suspicious, but in reality, these are placeholders used often in malicious scripts. Additionally, the repeated use of temporary filenames (like estrutura_temporario.txt and tarefa_ativo.txt) suggests that these files might be executed or deleted after a short period.\n\nThe use of different GitHub repositories in each download is another red flag. Legitimate software usually doesn't vary the sources like this, especially for components as basic as LICENSE files. It seems like an attempt to avoid detection by spreading out the activities across various URLs.\n\nWhile some events might not seem suspicious on their own, such as the ones involving winlogbeat.exe or RuntimeBroker.exe, when combined with the other events, they contribute to a pattern that suggests potential malicious behavior. The consistency in using powershell.exe for downloading files and creating temporary files is concerning, especially since PowerShell is often a tool used by attackers due to its scripting capabilities.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is typically associated with console host processes but can sometimes be involved in malicious activities as well, though it's not always a clear indicator on its own.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple indicators of potential malicious activity: repeated use of powershell.exe for downloading files from external sources, creation of temporary files, and unusual registry modifications. These events collectively suggest that there might be an ongoing attack or at least suspicious behavior worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell executing commands to download files from GitHub repositories using WebClient. The repeated use of temporary filenames suggests potential malicious activity, and the varied GitHub sources may indicate attempts to evade detection.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the user has provided a JSONL file with multiple events, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because calc.exe often loads system DLLs. Then there are a few svchost.exe events with registry changes. Svchost is a common system process, so some registry activity might be standard.\n\nI notice that Calculator.exe also loads the same urlmon.dll as calc.exe. Hmm, both being system processes accessing known DLLs—nothing suspicious yet.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe accessed. PowerShell can be used maliciously, but it's commonly used for legitimate tasks too. The command line here isn't shown, so I'm not sure. Then there's whoami.exe run in cmd. Whoami is usually harmless and often used by scripts to check permissions. \n\nLooking further, cmd.exe is used with SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn.\" That caught my attention because deleting tasks might be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, there are multiple attempts to delete registry entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run using REG DELETE and powershell.exe. These entries often relate to startup programs, so repeated deletions could indicate an attempt to remove traces or prevent certain scripts from running on startup.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command deletes a value \"modulo_temporario\" which sounds like it might be part of a custom script's naming convention. Then reg.exe is used to delete another registry key \"pacote_auxiliar.\" The consistent use of REG DELETE across different keys suggests a systematic effort, possibly to clean up after some malicious activity or to prevent certain scripts from running at startup.\n\nThe events also show multiple process creations and accesses related to powershell.exe and cmd.exe. While this doesn't necessarily indicate malware on its own, the combination with registry deletions raises suspicion. Malware often deletes its traces from the registry to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of deleting scheduled tasks and registry entries which are common techniques in persistence mechanisms. The repeated use of tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe for these operations could be signs of malicious activity attempting to clean up or hide itself. \n\nI'm not seeing any direct evidence of an active attack, but the batch shows behaviors that might indicate a compromised system trying to remove traces of previous malicious activities. So overall, this batch seems worth investigating further due to the suspicious combination of process creations and registry modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations (e.g., powershell.exe, cmd.exe) and registry modifications (e.g., deleting values from HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is commonly used by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or executed with command lines like '& {}'. That seems a bit unusual—maybe it's invoking another script or command.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several tasks related to process creation and access. For example, 'Process Create' events indicate that new processes were started, which could be normal but might also signify malicious activity if the processes aren't expected. There's also a 'Registry value set' event tied to powershell.exe, which makes me think about potential persistence mechanisms or attempts to modify system configurations.\n\nAnother point is the file operations. Powershell created a temporary script file and then deleted it shortly after. This behavior might be trying to avoid detection by not leaving traces, but in this case, the logs captured both actions, so it's visible now. Temporary files can sometimes be part of malicious scripts that don't need persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there are image load events for various DLLs when powershell.exe runs. While it's normal for scripts to load libraries, certain DLLs might be red flags if they're known to be associated with malware or contain malicious code.\n\nThere's also an entry where winlogbeat.exe created a configuration file. That seems benign unless it's part of some larger activity, but I don't see any other events related to that process that raise concerns.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances with actions like creating and deleting temporary files, accessing registry values, and loading various DLLs suggests possible malicious behavior. The repeated use of powershell.exe could indicate script execution or lateral movement within a network. While some actions might be legitimate, the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes were detected with unusual activities including file creation and deletion of temporary scripts, registry modifications, and loading various DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they are interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. It's being accessed multiple times with different tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. Also, cmd.exe is involved in some process creations and registry changes. There are instances where whoami.exe is run, which could be used to check user permissions—something that might be part of privilege escalation.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe creates files in the Temp directory, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. Creating and then deleting a file quickly can be indicative of malicious activity trying to bypass certain security policies or testing if scripts are allowed to run. The fact that this file is created and then deleted might suggest it's part of some script execution test.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines like \"& {}\" seems unusual. Typically, in normal usage, you'd see more specific commands or paths. This pattern could be a red flag for something trying to hide its true purpose or for persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are multiple RegistryEvent tasks from various processes, including cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Frequent registry changes might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, possibly for persistence or to alter security settings.\n\nThe process names like ApplicationFrameHost.exe interacting with the registry could be normal, but combined with all the powershell activity, it raises suspicions. It's possible that this is part of a larger campaign where multiple tools are being used in sequence.\n\nI also see several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this isn't necessarily malicious on its own, when coupled with other activities like file creation and deletion, it could be part of executing malicious scripts or payloads.\n\nThe high frequency of Provider Lifecycle tasks might indicate some kind of service or component being loaded repeatedly, which in the context of other events, could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of creating\/deleting files quickly in Temp, repeated powershell executions with unusual command lines, registry modifications, and file loads. These behaviors collectively point towards potential malicious activity, possibly script execution testing policies or evading detection. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the registry and creating\/deleting files in the Temp directory, which may indicate malicious activity such as script execution testing or policy evasion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a batch of JSONL events and wants to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. They want only one classification and justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. Starting with Calculator.exe setting a registry value—that seems normal since many applications do that on startup or configuration changes.\n\nNext, multiple entries from powershell.exe: creating pipes, accessing processes, loading images, and file operations. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe events, it's also showing registry modifications and pipe creation. While Chrome can make such changes for updates or extensions, the sheer number of these events (six in total) is unusual and worth noting, as excessive writes could be a sign of something more nefarious.\n\nThe whoami.exe process stands out because it's often used to check user permissions or system information. Its execution without obvious context could be part of a reconnaissance effort by an attacker.\n\nThen there are the conhost.exe and powershell.exe events related to file creation, which might be creating or deleting files in non-standard locations—another potential indicator of malicious activity.\n\nThe command lines for some powershell.exe instances look suspicious: one has \"& {Remove-Item ...}\", which is a common way to execute arbitrary scripts. This could be an attempt to delete logs or evidence, which raises the alarm level.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it's clear that there are multiple red flags—excessive use of PowerShell with potentially malicious commands, registry modifications, file operations in unexpected areas, and the use of whoami.exe. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate a cyberattack or unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation to prevent potential breaches.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and activities such as registry modifications, file operations, and process accesses.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of events all related to PowerShell and other processes. \n\nFirst off, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with commands that remove files from the TEMP directory. For example, lines like \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\tarefa_base.zip\" stand out. This seems suspicious because deleting specific files in a loop might indicate an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell is creating and then deleting temporary files, such as \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1\". Creating a script file only to delete it shortly after could be a way to execute malicious code without leaving it around for too long.\n\nI also notice that the same process creates multiple files in the TEMP directory and then deletes them. This repeated pattern might suggest automated deletion, which is common in malware to clean up after themselves. The use of different filenames like .zip and .txt further indicates varied targets, not just a single script or file being handled.\n\nLooking at other processes mentioned, like chrome.exe accessing registry values and loading DLLs, those could be normal activities since Chrome often interacts with system components. However, the sheer number of PowerShell events raises flags. Malicious actors tend to abuse legitimate tools like PowerShell for their activities because it's commonly allowed and can execute various commands.\n\nMoreover, there are entries where whoami.exe is run, which might be used to gather information about the current user or system. This could be part of reconnaissance to understand the environment before more malicious actions.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows a lot of activity that seems out of place. The repeated file deletions, creation of temporary scripts, and use of PowerShell commands are red flags indicating potential malicious behavior. While some events might look innocent on their own, the combination across the entire batch makes it stand out as concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell deleting files in the TEMP directory and creating\/running temporary scripts suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are all related to powershell.exe. The command lines show that it's trying to remove files from the TEMP directory with some filenames ending in .txt. That's a bit unusual because PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but deleting files could be part of malicious activity like clearing traces.\n\nI notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading images. This isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, but combined with the file deletions, it raises an eyebrow. Malware might use these actions to maintain persistence or hide evidence.\n\nThere are several events where files are created and then deleted, like the PS script test file and others in the TEMP directory. The fact that they're being deleted shortly after creation suggests something is trying to cover its tracks. This behavior can be a red flag for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at some events, there's also a process called conhost.exe accessing registry values. Conhost is typically used by command-line tools but seeing it here adds another layer—maybe it's part of some script execution or persistence mechanism.\n\nThen, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. This could be for checking permissions or gathering information about the user, which is common in recon activities before a more substantial attack.\n\nConsidering all these events together: repeated file deletions from TEMP, process activity with powershell.exe and conhost.exe, registry modifications, and a system info tool being executed. These are classic signs of potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' with a task indicating a registry value was set. This seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions. There's nothing immediately suspicious here unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, I notice multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. The fact that it's accessed multiple times could be concerning if there are other red flags, but on its own, it might just be normal user activity or script execution.\n\nThen there are entries where 'whoami.exe' is executed with the command line showing it's accessing system32. Whoami is a standard tool for checking user information, so this in isolation isn't suspicious unless it's being used in an unexpected way.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management and shipping, so this seems benign—it might be setting up configuration files during installation or updates.\n\nFinally, another PowerShell instance created the file 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's worth noting that malicious actors sometimes create such files to exfiltrate data or leave traces.\n\nPutting all these together: a lot of normal processes with some elevated privileges or tool usage. While each event on its own might not be concerning, the combination could hint at potential lateral movement or persistence activities. For example, using PowerShell to access processes and create files might be part of an attack chain. However, without more context like timestamps or other indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to definitively say this is malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because the repeated use of tools with potential for abuse and the creation of specific files could warrant closer examination. But my confidence isn't very high because each event alone doesn't cross clear red lines, and there's no evidence of overtly malicious actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving potentially suspicious activities such as repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, multiple powershell.exe accesses, whoami.exe executions, and file creations that may indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
