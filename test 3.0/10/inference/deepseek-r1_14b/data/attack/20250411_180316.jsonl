{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking through each event carefully.\n\nThe first few entries involve processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe with tasks like Registry value set or Process accessed. These seem common, but I should keep an eye out for anything unusual.\n\nThen there's a process named Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, isn't that a known DLL used in some malicious activities? Or maybe it's just normal operationâ€”I'm not sure yet. Similarly, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and whoami.exe are standard processes, so their logs don't raise immediate flags.\n\nLooking further down, I notice multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing or modifying registry values. Powershell is often a target for attackers because it can execute commands. The command lines in these events aren't provided, which makes it harder to assess if they're malicious. But seeing powershell being used multiple times could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process with the command \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That looks like an attempt to delete Notepad processes using WMIC, which is a tool often misused by attackers for remote commands. This is definitely concerning because deleting processes can hide activity or disrupt system functions.\n\nAnother event involves WMIC.exe creating a process with the command \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". This is another attempt to delete Notepad using WMIC, which adds to the suspicion of potential malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, I see multiple entries from svchost.exe modifying registry values. While svchost is a legitimate system process, it's also commonly used by malware to hide activities or establish persistence. The repetitive RegistryEvent tasks might be an attempt to alter system configurations in a way that could facilitate attacks.\n\nThere are several instances of chrome.exe accessing registry values, but since Chrome is a common application, this likely isn't malicious unless there's more context about the specific actions taken.\n\nAlso, I notice some events related to file loads, like urlmon.dll being loaded by Calculator.exe and WMIC.exe. This DLL is part of Windows URL parsing functionality but has been involved in some attack methods for code execution. The fact that multiple processes are loading it might warrant closer inspection.\n\nThe event with winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems legitimate, as it's likely the log shipping tool writing its configuration.\n\nIn summary, while many events appear normal, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with potentially malicious commands, along with attempts to delete Notepad.exe using WMIC, are significant red flags. These actions could indicate an attacker trying to execute commands or cover their tracks. Additionally, the multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and loading of urlmon.dll across different processes add to the suspicion.\n\nI'm confident enough that these activities together suggest potential malicious behavior, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including powershell.exe accessing registry and process deletion attempts using WMIC indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe accessing the registry with the task \"RegistryEvent\". This isn't unusual since Chrome often modifies system settings or extensions that interact with the registry. There are several such events, but without any signs of errors or repeated failed attempts, they don't raise red flags on their own.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe entries. Powershell is a powerful tool and can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The actions here include \"Process accessed\" which could mean it's querying information about other processes, and some registry modifications with \"RegistryEvent\". However, without specific indicators like known malicious script execution or access to sensitive files, these actions don't stand out as suspicious.\n\nI notice a couple of whoami.exe executions. Whoami is typically used to determine user identity and system info, which can be part of legitimate system administration tasks or reconnaissance by attackers. But again, isolated instances without unusual command-line arguments aren't alarming.\n\nThere are cmd.exe entries with various commands. For example, one command copies an exe file from a backup location to the original name, which could indicate replacing system files. This is concerning because altering system binaries can lead to instability or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, there's a command deleting a scheduled task using schtasks. Deleting tasks might be part of removing traces or preventing certain actions, but without context on what the task does, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command has an empty argument after \/c, which doesn't make sense. This could be a failed attempt or perhaps a placeholder for future commands, raising some suspicion about potential misuse.\n\nLooking at schtasks.exe, there's both a creation and deletion event of a task named \"win32times\". Scheduled tasks can be used maliciously to run payloads at specific times. The fact that it was created and then deleted might suggest an attempt to remove evidence or prevent execution, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThere's also an entry for svchost.exe modifying the registry. SvcHost is often associated with services and can sometimes be exploited by malware to hide processes. However, without seeing specific service modifications or known malicious activity related to it, this alone isn't enough to classify the batch as interesting.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of multiple powershell executions, cmd.exe modifying system files and deleting tasks, along with registry changes across various processes, suggests potential malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain, such as establishing persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The empty command in cmd.exe adds to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence like known malware signatures or specific indicators of compromise (IoCs). Without more context, it's hard to definitively conclude that this is an attack. But the pattern of behavior across multiple processes and actions leans towards something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations, registry modifications, and file operations involving potentially malicious activities such as replacing system files, deleting scheduled tasks, and suspicious command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"HIGH\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where different processes like cmd.exe and chrome.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities, so that's something to note. I remember that attackers often modify the Windows Registry to persistence their malware.\n\nNext, I see several instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and used with various tasks like ProcessAccess and ImageLoad. Powershell is a powerful tool often misused by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's accessing different DLLs might be normal, but the repeated use could indicate something suspicious.\n\nThere are also events involving conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost.exe is typically used in Windows PowerShell to host console applications, but it can sometimes be abused. Whoami.exe is usually benign, used to check user information, so unless it's being run with other malicious commands, it might not be a red flag on its own.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I notice that powershell.exe is being called with \"& {}\", which is an empty command. This could be an attempt to bypass certain security monitoring by not executing any actual code. Alternatively, it might just be a legitimate use, but repeated empty calls are unusual and worth investigating.\n\nAnother point is the file created event by powershell.exe in the Temp directory. Temporary files created by scripts can be part of normal operations, but if this script isn't expected or runs with elevated privileges, it could indicate malicious activity like dropping payloads or creating persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also see that chrome.exe is loading legitimate DLLs, which doesn't raise any immediate flags. The registry modifications from various processes might not be suspicious on their own unless they're modifying known persistence points or causing unexpected changes.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious behavior: repeated powershell usage with empty commands, attempts to modify the registry, and creating files in temporary directories. These activities could be part of an attack chain, such as establishing persistence, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with unusual command lines and file creations in the Temp directory, along with repeated registry modifications, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event shows that PowerShell.exe is deleting a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. That's a bit concerning because scripts in temporary folders can sometimes be malicious, especially if they're being deleted after execution.\n\nNext, there are several events where PowerShell is launching with command lines that seem to exit if certain files don't exist. For example, \"powershell.exe & {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This looks like a script check; if the specified .bat file exists, it exits successfully. If not, it fails. This pattern repeats several times with different paths.\n\nThen there are events where other processes like winlogbeat.exe and conhost.exe make registry changes or create files. Notably, whoami.exe is run, which usually isn't harmful but can be used to gather system information, potentially for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, I see File Delete, Provider Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and Process Create\/Access. These are pretty generic events but could indicate malicious activity when seen in combination.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes checking for specific files that don't exist suggests some kind of script execution logic. The repeated checks with different paths might be trying to locate something or ensure certain conditions are met before proceeding. This behavior is common in both legitimate scripts and malware, where the latter often uses such checks to avoid detection or activation.\n\nThe deletion of a PowerShell script file could be part of cleaning up after execution, which is something attackers might do to remove traces. The use of whoami.exe adds another layer; it's often used by attackers to check system information without doing anything harmful on its own but can be part of a larger sequence.\n\nAdditionally, the events involving winlogbeat.exe and conhost.exe modifying registries could be related to persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation, depending on what exactly is being changed. Without more context on the registry keys involved, it's hard to say definitively, but such changes are notable.\n\nPutting it all together, while some of these actions individually might not raise red flags, the combinationâ€”especially the repeated PowerShell checks and deletionsâ€”suggests potentially malicious behavior. This could indicate an attempt to execute scripts under certain conditions or remove evidence after execution.\n\nHowever, there's also a chance that this is part of a legitimate system process, such as some automated script running checks across multiple directories. Without more data on the context (e.g., user activity around the time these events occurred, exact file paths being checked, etc.), it's challenging to be certain.\n\nGiven the cautious approach in cybersecurity, any unusual PowerShell activity combined with file deletions and registry modifications should generally be looked into. So, I think this batch does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:**\n   - **PowerShell Activity:** Multiple events show PowerShell.exe executing scripts and deleting files. The deletion of a script file after execution is suspicious as it can help cover tracks.\n   - **File Checks:** Several command lines indicate checks for specific .bat files not present, suggesting potential malicious logic to proceed only under certain conditions.\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Changes by winlogbeat.exe and conhost.exe could be persistence mechanisms or part of privilege escalation tactics.\n   - **whoami.exe Usage:** While generally benign, its use can be part of information gathering in attacks.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - The repeated pattern of PowerShell checks with different file paths is notable. Such behavior is often seen in malware to avoid detection or ensure certain conditions are met.\n   - Combined with the deletion of a script file, this suggests a possible malicious payload execution followed by cleanup.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment:**\n   - While individual events might not be alarming, their combination points towards potential malicious activity. The use of multiple checks and deletions is concerning in the context of cybersecurity threats.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the suspicious patterns and activities observed across these events, further investigation is necessary to determine if this constitutes a security threat.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits characteristics that suggest potential malicious activity, particularly due to repeated PowerShell checks, file deletions, and other system modifications. Therefore, it is classified as **interesting for investigation**. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"event_classification\": \"Interesting for Investigation\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell script execution, file deletion patterns, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. The first event shows that powershell.exe was executed with a specific command line. The command checks if a certain file path exists (C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat) and exits with 0 if it does, else 1. This could be part of legitimate scripting or maybe checking for the presence of malicious files.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being accessed or has loaded images related to .NET framework components like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. PowerShell often uses these libraries, so this isn't unusual on its own. However, combined with other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nI notice several FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events related to temporary files in the user's AppData directory, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. This seems like PowerShell is creating and then deleting script files, possibly as part of testing or during execution. Legitimate scripts might do this, but it could also be a way to hide malicious activity by cleaning up evidence.\n\nThere's an event where a file was created in the Downloads folder: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt. The filename is generic, so without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe. Since Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings and extensions, these could be normal unless they're modifying unexpected areas.\n\nThe last few events again involve powershell.exe accessing certain DLLs related to Windows Defender, which might indicate an attempt to bypass or manipulate antivirus detection. Also, the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder suggests that PowerShell is setting up some persistent configuration, which could be part of a malicious script for persistence.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows repeated use of powershell.exe with specific checks on file existence, creation and deletion of temporary script files, interaction with system components, and registry modifications. These activities don't definitively prove malware, but they do raise flags that could indicate suspicious behavior. The confidence level is high because while some actions are normal, the combination and frequency suggest potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several behaviors that, while not conclusive on their own, collectively suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n1. **PowerShell Execution with File Checks:** The repeated execution of powershell.exe with commands checking for specific file paths could indicate an attempt to verify the presence of malicious files or components.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion:** The creation and subsequent deletion of temporary script files in the AppData directory might be an attempt to hide evidence, common in malware to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications by Chrome.exe:** While Chrome often interacts with the registry, multiple events here could warrant monitoring if they involve unexpected areas, though this alone isn't suspicious.\n\n4. **Access to Defender Components:** The involvement of Windows Defender-related DLLs might suggest attempts to bypass antivirus measures or manipulate system security features.\n\n5. **Persistent Configuration Setup:** The creation of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder could indicate an attempt at persistence by a malicious script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThese activities, particularly the combination of file checks, temporary script handling, and interaction with security components, raise concerns about potential malicious intent. While not definitive proof, they justify closer monitoring or further investigation into these events to ensure system integrity. \n\n**Confidence Level:** High (4\/5)  \n**Recommendation:** Monitor for recurring patterns, review the specific file paths referenced, and consider additional log analysis or endpoint detection measures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"suspicion_level\": \"high\",\n  \"summary\": \"The batch shows behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity involving powershell.exe, temporary files, and system component interaction.\",\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Monitor for recurring patterns in file accesses and registry modifications.\",\n      \"details\": \"Look for repeated attempts to access specific files or unusual registry changes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Review the specific file paths referenced in powershell.exe commands.\",\n      \"details\": \"Check if these files are associated with known malicious activities or scripts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Investigate interactions with Windows Defender components.\",\n      \"details\": \"Ensure that no unauthorized attempts to disable or manipulate antivirus features are occurring.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events, and I need to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first few events are powershell.exe processes with tasks like 'Registry value set' and no file information. That's a bit generic because PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be malicious. So I'm noting that but not sure yet if it's suspicious.\n\nThen, there's an event where powershell.exe runs a command line that creates new files in various directories. The commands look like they're creating batch files and setting their content to 'dir'. Hmm, creating scripts could be part of legitimate administration or could be setting up persistence mechanisms for malware. That definitely raises an eyebrow.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads different DLLs. That's normal because PowerShell might load various libraries depending on the script being run. But combined with other suspicious activities, it's worth monitoring.\n\nSeveral events have 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks, which I'm not too familiar with, but they seem related to system services or drivers. If these are initiated by powershell.exe, it could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, which might be malicious.\n\nThere's also a file creation event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. Creating scripts in temp directories is common for temporary tasks but can also be a sign of malware dropping files there to execute later.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe creating new batch files and scripts across different paths, along with registry modifications and DLL loads. This behavior seems unusual for normal operations because it's repetitive and targets various system components. It could indicate script injection or attempts to create persistence points across the system. The repeated file creations and command lines that write 'dir' suggest a possible attempt to modify the system in ways that might be part of an attack.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of activities seems beyond typical user behavior, especially with the multiple script creations and modifications across different directories. It's worth further investigation to check if these scripts are doing more than just containing 'dir' commands.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:**\n   - The batch contains 18 events related to powershell.exe activities.\n   - Events include registry modifications, file creations, and DLL loadings.\n\n2. **Identifying Red Flags:**\n   - Multiple instances of creating new batch files in various directories using powershell.exe commands.\n   - Repetitive patterns suggest a potential script injection or system modification attempt.\n\n3. **Behavior Assessment:**\n   - Creating scripts in different paths could be for persistence or malicious activities.\n   - Registry modifications and DLL loadings might indicate attempts to alter system configurations.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of events exceeds typical user behavior, suggesting possible malicious intent.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch is classified as INTERESTING due to the suspicious and repetitive powershell.exe activities involving file creation and system modification, indicating potential malicious behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"finding\": {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"title\": \"Potential Malicious Script Injection\",\n    \"description\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating new batch files and scripts across different directories suggest possible script injection or system persistence attempts.\",\n    \"severity\": \"High\",\n    \"confidence\": \"Medium\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows that PowerShell is deleting a file in the Temp directory. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's deleting a file, especially one with a somewhat random name like __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1, might be part of a script's cleanup process or could indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThe second event is about a pipe being created by PowerShell. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication. This in itself isn't necessarily suspicious, but combined with other activities from the same process, it might raise flags. It's hard to say without more context, though.\n\nLooking at the third event, there's a command line that shows a script being executed through PowerShell. The script paths like \"C:\\\\registro_secundario\\\\unidade_secundario\\\\..\\\\elemento_comum\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat\" seem a bit convoluted. The backslashes and the use of \"..\\\\\" could be an attempt to navigate directories, which might be part of privilege escalation or file injection techniques.\n\nThe fourth event mentions that PowerShell loaded MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. This isn't unusual because many legitimate processes load system DLLs. However, if this were part of a malicious script trying to bypass detection, it could be relevant.\n\nNext, there are several events where files are being created by PowerShell scripts. The file paths have consistent patterns and naming conventions that seem repetitive. While creating files is a normal operation for scripts, the specific naming (like *_script.bat) might indicate temporary files used in a script's execution flow. If these files are meant to be executed later or if they contain malicious code, this could be concerning.\n\nThere are multiple registry value sets by both PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be legitimate but also often part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The fact that it's happening across different processes raises the suspicion that someone is trying to ensure their presence on the system isn't easily removable.\n\nThe latter half of the events show several provider lifecycles with similar command lines. Each command checks if a specific batch file exists using Test-Path and exits accordingly. This behavior could be part of a script ensuring it only runs once or checking for some condition. However, this kind of check is also common in malware to avoid re-execution.\n\nPutting all these events together: repeated PowerShell activities with file deletions, pipe creation, loading system DLLs, creating specific files, and modifying the registry. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious activity. The use of temporary files with *_script.bat suggests they might be executing scripts that could be harmful. While some actions are benign, the combination points towards potential compromise.\n\nI should also consider if there's any indication of user interaction or known processes. Since all these events come from PowerShell and involve file system and registry operations, it aligns with how scripts execute on a system. Without knowing more about the source of these scripts or the context in which they're running, it's hard to be certain, but the red flags are present.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several indicators that could potentially suggest malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **File Deletion by PowerShell**: The deletion of a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 in the Temp directory is notable. Such actions might be part of cleanup routines, possibly to remove traces of prior activities.\n\n2. **Pipe Creation**: The creation of a pipe in PowerShell can facilitate inter-process communication. While not inherently suspicious, it's worth monitoring when combined with other actions.\n\n3. **Script Execution and File Operations**: Multiple events show PowerShell executing scripts that create files with names ending in *_script.bat. These files are located in various directories, suggesting they might be temporary or part of a script's execution flow.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Both PowerShell and conhost.exe have modified the registry. While normal for some legitimate processes, this could also indicate persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\n5. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: The repeated command lines checking for specific batch files suggest scripts ensuring they run only once or under certain conditions, a tactic sometimes employed by malicious actors to avoid detection.\n\n**Conclusion**: The cumulative behaviorâ€”file deletions, pipe creation, script execution with temporary files, and registry modificationsâ€”raises concerns about potential malicious activity. These indicators could point towards a system compromise or an attempt at persistence or evasion. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these activities and ensure system integrity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running scripts with command lines that check the existence of certain files. Each time, it's using Test-Path to see if a specific .bat file exists and then exiting with 0 or 1 based on whether it finds the file. The paths being checked seem similar but vary slightly each time.\n\nI also notice that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs related to Windows Defender, which could be normal as PowerShell often uses these for its operations. There are some file creation and deletion events in the Temp directory, specifically a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest with random-looking filenames. This seems suspicious because creating and then deleting files quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity related to registry value sets and process accesses. These actions could be part of legitimate operations, but combined with the other events, they raise some flags. The use of whoami.exe is another point; it's often used to check user permissions or for lateral movement in attacks.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: repeated PowerShell executions checking various paths, creation\/deletion of temporary files, registry modifications, and process access. This combination suggests possible malicious activity like script testing, file persistence mechanisms, or credential dumping. The fact that multiple similar command lines are present might indicate automated testing or a script trying different paths to find an existing malicious file.\n\nThe lack of any clear benign justification for such repeated checks and temporary file operations makes this batch interesting. It's possible that the system is being probed for vulnerabilities or attempting to execute malicious scripts. Therefore, further investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions with command lines checking various file paths, followed by file creation and deletion in the Temp directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of logs. So, I'm given a series of events in JSONL format, each representing some activity on the system. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events are related to PowerShell.exe processes. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with different command lines. Each command line seems to be checking if a specific file exists in various paths and exiting with 0 if it does, else 1. This pattern repeats several times with different file paths.\n\nLooking closer at the tasks associated with these events, there's a mix of 'Process Create', 'Process Access', 'Image Load', 'File Create', 'File Delete', and 'Registry Value Set'. The fact that multiple Image Loads are happening suggests that PowerShell is loading various DLLs which might be part of its normal operation, but it's still something to note.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created and immediately deleted. This could be a sign of a script trying to write to the disk but then removing itself quickly to avoid detection, or it might just be a legitimate process. It's also worth mentioning that the file path includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which makes me think it's related to PowerShell's scripting policy testing.\n\nAnother point is the use of cmd.exe with a command line that checks for the existence of a file named \"objeto_logico.txt\" in the temp directory. This could be another attempt to verify if certain files exist, possibly as part of a larger script or process.\n\nI also see events involving 'whoami.exe' being executed. While this is a common command used to determine user information, it's often used by scripts or processes to gather system details, which in some cases can be part of malicious activities like lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting all these together, the repetitive checks for files across different directories and the use of multiple tools (PowerShell, cmd.exe) could indicate a script attempting to map out the system's configuration or presence of certain binaries. The combination of file operations, registry access, and process creation is often seen in malicious activities where an adversary is trying to ensure persistence or check their 'footprint' on the system.\n\nThe fact that the same pattern repeats with different paths suggests a possible script iterating over various directories to look for specific files. This behavior can be indicative of reconnaissance or exfiltration attempts, which would definitely merit further investigation.\n\nWhile it's possible that these activities are part of legitimate system administration tasks, the variety and persistence of the checks make me lean towards them being potentially malicious. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting enough to warrant a deeper look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch is **interesting** for investigation due to the repeated file existence checks across different paths using PowerShell and cmd.exe, along with other suspicious activities like quick file creation\/deletion and registry modifications.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Dominant Process Activity**: \n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` processes being created with varying command lines.\n   - Each command line checks if a specific file exists in different directories (e.g., `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\elemento_temporario\\componente_principal\\bin\\entrada_auxiliar.exe`).\n   - This pattern suggests repeated attempts to verify the presence of files across several paths.\n\n2. **File and Registry Operations**:\n   - Events include file creation, deletion, and registry value modifications.\n   - Notably, a file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest` is created and immediately deleted, which might indicate an attempt to test scripting policies or leave minimal traces.\n\n3. **Use of cmd.exe**:\n   - A command (`cmd.exe \/c IF EXIST %%temp%%\\objeto_logico.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`) checks for a file in the temp directory.\n   - This could be part of a script verifying if specific files exist, potentially as part of malicious activity.\n\n4. **whoami.exe Execution**:\n   - Running `whoami.exe` can help gather user information, which is often used by attackers during lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\n5. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - The repetitive nature of file checks and use of multiple tools (`powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`) could indicate a script attempting to map the system's configuration or presence of certain binaries.\n   - Such behavior is often seen in reconnaissance, persistence, or exfiltration activities.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - While some actions might appear benign, the combination of file operations, registry access, and repeated process creation points towards potentially malicious intent.\n   - Further investigation into these processes and their sources is recommended to assess the risk and determine if a breach has occurred.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe batch is **interesting** for investigation due to the repeated file existence checks, use of multiple tools, and other suspicious activities that may indicate malicious behavior."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is powershell.exe with tasks like Process accessed and Registry value set. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripts and malicious activities, so repeated access could be a red flag. But I need to look at the context.\n\nThen, there are instances of cmd.exe accessing the registry. That's normal admin activity but could also be part of malicious behavior if combined with other actions.\n\nThere are multiple whoami.exe executions without any arguments. Whoami is often used to check user permissions, which might be a reconnaissance step by attackers.\n\nLooking further, I see powershell.exe processes with command lines that include paths like C:\\Windows\\System32\\... and conditional checks using Test-Path. These command lines look unusual because they're checking for the existence of specific files on the system. The fact that these paths are spread across different directories might indicate an attempt to verify if certain files exist, which could be part of a larger script execution.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. While this is normal for Powershell scripts, combined with the other activities, it might suggest that malicious code is being executed.\n\nFinally, multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks in the logs without any associated files make me think these could be process creation events tied to specific script executions. The fact that each command line has a different path but similar conditional checks suggests some automation or repeated attempts to execute scripts based on file existence.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of Powershell with unusual paths and conditions, along with registry access and whoami.exe, points towards potential malicious activity. This could be an attacker testing if certain files exist before executing more significant actions. The batch shows a pattern that's worth investigating to ensure there's no ongoing compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the registry and checking for file existence, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving powershell.exe. That's common because PowerShell is often used both for legitimate tasks and by attackers. But the combination of certain activities could be red flags. For example, there are events where PowerShell loads images like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender directories. On its own, that might not be suspicious since Defender uses these components. However, it's worth noting because sometimes attackers might try to hide malicious activity by using legitimate processes.\n\nNext, I see file creation and deletion events in temporary directories. For instance, a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1, then immediately deleted. That seems odd because why create and delete a script so quickly? Maybe it's testing if the script policy exists or not, which could be part of an attempt to bypass restrictions. The fact that this happens twice makes me think there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some events, I spot several PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of various files across different paths. Each check uses Test-Path and exits with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. This behavior might be part of a script trying to locate specific files as part of its operation. However, if these files are related to malicious activities, such as keystroke loggers (Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is mentioned multiple times), this could indicate an attempt to ensure the presence or absence of certain components.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set events from PowerShell. Modifying the registry can be normal, but combined with other activities, it might signal configuration changes that allow persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThere's also a process creation event for whoami.exe, which on its own isn't suspicious. It's often used to determine user information. But when paired with the extensive use of PowerShell, it adds another layer to consider.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated file checks and deletions, coupled with the attempts to load specific DLLs and modify registry entries, make this batch stand out. These behaviors could be part of a larger script trying to establish persistence or gather information, which aligns with some attack patterns. However, without more context, it's hard to definitively say if it's malicious, but the indicators are enough to warrant closer examination.\n\nI'm leaning towards marking these as interesting because they combine several activities that, while not individually suspicious, together could indicate a potential security issue. The high number of checks for specific files and scripts, especially ones named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which I recognize as often used in malicious scripts for capturing keystrokes, adds to the concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch shows behaviors that are worth investigating further due to the combination of file operations, process activity, and script checks that could be indicative of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity:** The events show extensive use of powershell.exe, which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks.\n\n2. **File Operations:** There are instances where temporary files are created and deleted quickly, possibly indicating attempts to test script policies or hide malicious activities.\n\n3. **Script Execution Checks:** Multiple command lines indicate scripts checking for specific files across various directories, potentially attempting to locate or execute malicious components like Get-Keystrokes.ps1.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:** Events show registry value changes from PowerShell, which could be part of establishing persistence or altering system configurations.\n\n5. **Legitimate Tools Misuse:** The use of whoami.exe and other tools might not be suspicious on their own but could be part of a larger attack vector when combined with other activities.\n\n6. **Behavioral Indicators:** The combination of file operations, process creation, and script checks raises concern due to potential malicious patterns, such as attempting to bypass restrictions or gather system information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events collectively exhibit behaviors that merit further investigation, particularly due to the suspicious file operations, repeated script checks, and potential use of malicious scripts. These indicators suggest possible malicious activity, making this batch of events significant for cybersecurity analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"indicator\": \"Malicious PowerShell Activity\",\n  \"description\": \"The logs show multiple instances of powershell.exe performing potentially suspicious activities including creating\/deleting temporary files, executing script checks, and modifying registry values.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data, each line represents an event with process info, winlog task, and file details. The first few events are all from powershell.exe accessing different files. They seem to be loading various DLLs which is normal for PowerShell scripts. Then there's a file creation and deletion of a .ps1 script in the Temp folder. That might be suspicious because creating and then deleting a script could indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nNext, I notice some \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks from powershell.exe with command lines checking if certain PS1 files exist. The paths mentioned look like they're trying to check for specific scripts, maybe part of malicious activities or testing permissions. There's also a mention of notepad.exe and calc.exe accessing some DLLs, which could be normal but might warrant a closer look.\n\nAdditionally, there are events from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file, which is likely just the log collection tool doing its thing. The whoami.exe process running seems harmless on its own.\n\nOverall, while most of these activities can be benign (like script execution or legitimate processes), the repeated PowerShell activity with file creation\/deletion and checking for specific scripts raises some red flags. It's possible that an attacker is trying to run a script and clean up evidence, or it could just be a script testing permissions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes accessing various files, including creation and deletion of a .ps1 file in the Temp folder.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used by administrators but can also be a red flag for malicious activities since it has scripting capabilities that can automate tasks, including potentially harmful ones. The fact that `powershell.exe` is accessing processes and registry values could indicate some level of exploration or modification on the system.\n\nLooking deeper, there's an event where `powershell.exe` is executed with a command line: `\"& {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}\"`. Breaking this down, it seems like the script is listing files and directories recursively. This kind of activity could be part of data gathering for exfiltration or to map out the system's structure, which might be a precursor to more malicious actions.\n\nAnother point of interest is the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file being created by `winlogbeat.exe`. While this could simply be log management software updating its configuration, it's worth noting since unusual file creation activities can sometimes indicate unauthorized changes or attempts to modify logging mechanisms to cover tracks.\n\nThe batch also shows several network connections from both `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe`, which is normal for browser processes but could potentially hide malicious traffic if these processes are being used for command and control communication. Additionally, the DNS queries might be part of normal browsing behavior or could be attempting to resolve domains associated with malicious activities.\n\nThe registry modifications in `powershell.exe` events stand out because attackers often use registry changes to persist on a system between reboots. This makes them particularly concerning as they can indicate an attempt to maintain access or alter system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the combination of PowerShell script execution with file and directory listings, registry modifications, and network activities from potentially suspicious processes does raise some red flags. While individual events might not be alarming on their own, taken collectively, they suggest a possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe events with commands that could indicate data gathering and potential system modifications, along with network activities from non-standard processes. This combination suggests possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event step by step and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, almost all of them involve powershell.exe processes. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's appearing so frequently suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe creates files in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. Temporary files can be a sign of scripts being executed or dropped files. The naming of these files, such as __PSScriptPolicyTest followed by random characters, seems suspicious. These could be part of script testing or configuration changes that attackers might make to bypass certain policies.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe deletes a file. File deletion is often part of an attacker's footprint to cover their tracks. Malicious actors might delete logs or evidence after compromising a system, so this event adds more concern.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some processes show repeated commands with 'ls -recurse' and similar directory listings. These could be attempts to gather information about the file structure, possibly looking for sensitive files or establishing presence on the network. The use of multiple directory listings might indicate a script trying to map out the environment.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems odd because Defender is a security product, but loading its DLL could be part of mimicking legitimate processes or evading detection by blending in with normal activity.\n\nAnother thing I see is events involving 'winlogbeat.exe', which I believe is an agent for Logstash or similar tools used for log management. If this process creates files in the downloads folder, it might not be suspicious on its own unless there's something unusual about the file names or access patterns. However, considering the overall context of other events, even this could be part of data exfiltration if logs are being collected and sent elsewhere.\n\nThere are a few registry accesses by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, where attackers store configurations to ensure their scripts run on each boot or at specific intervals. If these events coincide with other suspicious activities, it strengthens the case for investigation.\n\nLastly, there's an event where a file named estrutura_secundario.txt is created in the downloads folder. The name doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with the other activities, especially from powershell.exe, it could be part of data transfer or storing malicious configurations.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with various suspicious activitiesâ€”file creation\/deletion in temp directories, directory listings, DLL loading, registry modificationsâ€”points towards potential malicious behavior. The combination suggests a possible attack chain involving reconnaissance, lateral movement, and persistence. Even though some events might be benign, the volume and variety linked to powershell.exe make the batch concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities related to powershell.exe including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, directory listings, registry modifications, and loading of system DLLs. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
