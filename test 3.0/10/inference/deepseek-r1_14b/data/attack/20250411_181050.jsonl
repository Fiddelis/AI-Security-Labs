{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal because browsers do that when navigating. Next, whoami.exe is run without any command line arguments. Whoami is typically used to display user information, but running it alone isn't suspicious unless there's something else going on.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye out for more events related to it. The next event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which I think is part of log shipping, so that's probably okay.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access follows, still nothing concrete but worth noting. Then cmd.exe runs a command with certutil. Hmm, certutil can be used for encoding and decoding files, which can be part of malicious activities like creating malware from components. The command line here seems to encode calc.exe into a text file. That's a red flag because calc.exe is often used as an example in malicious payloads.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where certutil.exe is being used with commands like -encode and -decode, which aligns with the earlier observation. These actions could be part of base64 encoding or decoding to hide malicious code. Also, several file creations and executions happen in temporary directories, which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also registry value sets across various processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, rundll32.exe, and others. Registry modifications can be used by attackers to maintain persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nChrome.exe shows up multiple times with network connections and registry changes. While chrome is a legitimate process, unusual network activity or repeated registry access could indicate it's being exploited or part of an exfiltration attempt.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of using certutil for encoding\/decoding, creating files in temporary directories, modifying the registry across different processes, and network connections from chrome.exe suggests potential malicious activities. The repetitive use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with suspicious commands adds to the concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving potentially malicious activities such as using certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding, creating files in temporary directories, and registry modifications. These activities could indicate an attack chain including file creation, persistence, and potential execution of malicious payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let's see what each log says.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is a Registry value being set. Chrome doing registry writes isn't unusual; it might be setting some preferences or extensions. But having seven of these in a row could be suspicious, but not necessarily so because sometimes apps do batch updates. I should note that.\n\nNext, there's an entry from SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal too because those are system files. No red flags here.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creating a file looks like part of its normal operation since it's likely writing logs or configuration files. The path in the user's Downloads folder makes sense if that's where the tool is installed.\n\nNow, looking at powershell.exe: there are three entries. Two show Registry value sets and Process accesses. PowerShell doing these tasks can be benign but also potentially malicious because attackers often use it. However, without more context like specific registry keys or file writes, it's hard to say if this activity is bad.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has some normal activities and a few that could be red flags. The repetition of chrome.exe writing to the registry might warrant closer look, but not enough to classify the entire batch as definitely suspicious. So, I'm leaning towards interesting because of the potential PowerShell usage and repeated chrome activity, but not extremely confident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe, which could indicate unusual behavior. Additionally, powershell.exe shows Process access tasks, which may be malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
