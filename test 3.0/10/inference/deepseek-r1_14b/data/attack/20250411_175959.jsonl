{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me start by going through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. These seem normal because Chrome regularly makes such connections for browsing. So, nothing suspicious here on their own.\n\nNext, there's an entry involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The command line in the process shows a script that includes commands like net user, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe, and others. These commands are often associated with privilege escalation or system information gathering, which can be signs of potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses processes, writes to the registry, loads various DLLs, creates files in temporary directories, and then deletes them. The file creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1 is particularly notable because it suggests that a script was written and then deleted, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe might indicate the script is trying to establish persistence mechanisms or interact with system services. This kind of activity can be part of an attack chain, such as creating user accounts, adding users to groups like Users (which could grant them administrative privileges), and listing network resources which are typical steps in lateral movement.\n\nConsidering all these activities together—using PowerShell for script execution, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated process interactions—it's highly indicative of potential malicious behavior. The combination of these events suggests an attack vector rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially suspicious commands, including user account enumeration and file manipulation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice several PowerShell executions with command lines that include commands like net user, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, and others. These commands are often used for system administration but can also be indicators of malicious activity, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThere are multiple instances where PowerShell is being executed with specific commands. For example, the command line includes \"net user\" which could be used to list users, and \"get-localgroupmember -group Users\" which might retrieve group members. The use of cmdkey.exe \/list suggests that they're trying to list cached credentials, which is a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets by chrome.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, repeated writes could indicate something suspicious like persistence mechanisms or tracking.\n\nLooking at the files being accessed, some paths seem legitimate, but others, like the .winlogbeat.yml.new file and pacote_ativo.txt, don't provide enough context to rule out malicious intent.\n\nThe events also show process creations for cmdkey.exe and net1.exe with user commands. This could be an attempt to gather system information or disable security features.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple entries related to Security Group Management and User Account Management without any corresponding processes, which might indicate unauthorized access attempts or failed operations.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the pattern of using PowerShell for potentially malicious commands, combined with unusual file accesses and repeated registry modifications, makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that could indicate privilege escalation or system information gathering.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the task is \"Security Group Management\". These could be normal group policy updates or user activity changes, so nothing suspicious there unless they're happening too frequently or outside regular hours.\n\nNext, I notice processes like SDXHelper.exe loading various DLLs. That seems standard for system operations. The net.exe and powershell.exe commands are also common administrative tools, but their use should be monitored for context. For example, using net.exe to manage local groups is typical in an active directory environment but could be malicious if done by an unauthorized user.\n\nThe creation of PowerShell profile data files might indicate configuration changes or script execution. The creation of a file named modulo_base.txt could be suspicious—maybe related to lateral movement or credential dumping. This file name isn't common, so it stands out.\n\nThere are registry value sets in multiple processes like powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware, so this is worth looking into further. The fact that these events occur without a clear reason could be a red flag.\n\nThe MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process running with an installsource scheduler command might be normal for updates but could also be a sign of unauthorized software installation or persistence.\n\nLastly, the repeated activity from winlogbeat.exe creating files seems related to log shipping or data collection. If this is part of legitimate monitoring, it's not suspicious, but if it's new or unusual behavior, it could indicate an attacker trying to cover their tracks.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: multiple registry changes, creation of an unusual file, and the use of administrative tools without clear justification. These patterns could suggest malicious activity, so this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains several events indicative of potential malicious behavior, including multiple registry modifications, file creations in unusual locations, and the use of administrative tools (net.exe, powershell.exe) which may suggest unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.
