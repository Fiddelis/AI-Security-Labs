{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are all from powershell.exe with command lines that look like they're creating scheduled tasks. The command line is a bit tricky because it's in PowerShell, but I can parse it. Each event seems to be using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe at logon time, targeting the Administrators group and running at highest privilege level. That's concerning because calc.exe is typically benign, but setting up a scheduled task with admin rights could be malicious. It might mean someone is trying to persistence on the system.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being used to create these tasks with different names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The repetition suggests that this isn't a one-off script but something more deliberate. Also, each of these tasks is being registered, which could be an attempt to run calc.exe on startup as different users or under different contexts.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and processes. For example, 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' tasks. These might indicate that the script is modifying system configurations or accessing certain areas of the OS, which could be part of a broader attack.\n\nI also notice one event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and modifies the registry. While Chrome doing this isn't unusual, it's worth keeping an eye on because sometimes legitimate processes can be used in attacks. But without more context, it's hard to say if that's related or just normal activity.\n\nAnother thing I see is multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, specifically loading various .NET framework components. This aligns with how PowerShell operates, as it uses the .NET runtime. These events themselves aren't suspicious, but combined with the other activities, they support the idea that a script is running and possibly executing malicious actions.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks using powershell.exe to execute calc.exe at logon under high privileges stands out. This behavior is commonly associated with persistence techniques in malware or APTs. Even though calc.exe isn't harmful on its own, it's often used as a payload delivery mechanism or to pivot into more damaging activities once executed.\n\nMoreover, the repetitive creation of these tasks suggests an attempt to ensure that the malicious script runs reliably across reboots, which is a key component in persistence strategies for attackers. The use of different task names might be an effort to evade detection by using varied naming conventions.\n\nI should also consider whether these events are part of legitimate system administration or if they're indicative of compromise. Given the nature of the tasks and their privileges, it's more likely malicious unless there's a known reason why such scripts are running on the system.\n\nIn summary, the combination of multiple scheduled tasks created by powershell.exe with high privileges and the repeated use of potentially suspicious commands points towards these logs being interesting for further investigation. They could indicate a breach or an ongoing attack attempting to maintain persistence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits concerning activity indicative of potential malicious behavior, making them worthy of further investigation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Multiple Scheduled Task Creations:** Several events show powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. This pattern is often used in attacks for persistence.\n\n2. **Use of Elevated Privileges:** The tasks target the Administrators group and run at the highest privilege level, which is a red flag as it can allow escalation of privileges or system-wide changes.\n\n3. **Repetitive Task Creation:** The repeated creation of tasks with different names suggests a deliberate attempt to establish persistence rather than accidental duplication.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access:** Events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and other processes could indicate configuration changes or data exfiltration, common in attacks.\n\n5. **Image Load Events:** While not inherently suspicious, these events detail how PowerShell loads .NET components, supporting the operation of scripts that may have malicious intent.\n\n6. **Chrome Activity:** Although less concerning on its own, Chrome's actions might be part of a broader attack vector or unrelated noise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThese logs suggest potential malicious activity aimed at persistence and privilege escalation. Immediate action is recommended to investigate and mitigate possible threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. The first few events show ImageLoad and FileCreate\/Delete related to temporary files and Defender-related DLLs. That seems a bit odd because Defender shouldn't need PowerShell for those operations. Then there's a command line in one of the process logs where it's setting up a scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. That raises a red flagâ€”it looks like someone is trying to create a persistence mechanism using a legitimate tool, which can be malicious.\n\nNext, there are several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, multiple such events could indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not part of normal updates or extensions. However, without more context on what exactly is being changed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe latter half of the logs shows repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks but no associated process or file info. This is concerning because such events could be indicative of remote code execution, possibly by an attacker. The lack of additional data makes it harder to pinpoint, but the sheer number suggests ongoing activity that might not be benign.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a PowerShell script setting up a task to run calc.exe, which is a common test for persistence and privilege escalation. Additionally, numerous remote command executions and registry changes by Chrome could indicate unauthorized access or malicious scripts running in the environment. These points collectively make me think this batch of logs shows potential malicious activity that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities, including PowerShell command-line arguments setting up a scheduled task to execute calc.exe with admin privileges and repeated remote command executions without associated processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. I'm a bit new to analyzing system logs for malicious behavior, but I'll do my best.\n\nSo, the user provided a bunch of JSONL events and wants me to figure out if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. They also want just one classification with confidence and justification.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. The first event has process WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. I know that WmiPrvSE.exe is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, so maybe it's legitimate, but I'm not sure if this is a red flag. Task scheduler files being loaded might be normal.\n\n2. Next, there are multiple events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is known for hosting various services, and changing registry settings could be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities like persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. Then, another svchost event creates a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks. I'm not sure what's normal here, but creating files in system directories can sometimes indicate tampering, especially if done by non-system processes.\n\n4. There are several events from powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities like executing commands or downloading files. The FileCreate task might be writing scripts to disk, which could be suspicious depending on the content.\n\n5. Conhost.exe and chrome.exe also show up with registry changes and image loads. Chrome loading system DLLs might be standard, but multiple registry writes from different processes could indicate something more.\n\n6. Winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory seems benign, as it's likely a log management tool.\n\n7. Powershell again creates two files: entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt. The names don't immediately ring any bells, but powershell creating files can be part of malicious scripts or tools.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are multiple instances where svchost.exe is modifying registry values, which could be a sign of malware installation or persistence. Additionally, powershell.exe creating files and interacting with the file system might indicate script execution. The combination of these events across different processes raises some flags, suggesting potential malicious activity.\n\nI'm not entirely certain because some of these actions can also be part of normal operations, especially if the user is running scripts or legitimate software that interacts with the registry and file system. However, the frequency and variety of these activities do increase the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious behavior, such as svchost.exe modifying registry values, powershell.exe creating files, and unusual file operations which may suggest scripting or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
