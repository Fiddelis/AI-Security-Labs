{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193400.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object.\n\nFirst, the structure of each event seems consistent: they all have a \"process\" field and a \"winlog\" field. The \"process\" usually has a name or is null, while the \"winlog\" contains a task with specific values.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- There's a process named \"Registry\" creating an entry.\n- Then several tasks like SystemStart, VsmPolicyEnablement, DirtyBootShutdown, etc. These all seem related to system startup and configuration.\n\nI notice that most of these are standard Windows system logs, such as boot events, policy changes, user input time, battery count changes, and so on. Processes like smss.exe (which I know is a legitimate process for Session Manager SubSystem) are starting, which isn't unusual.\n\nThere's one event where the task is \"Process Creation\" with a null process name, but that's vague. It could be any process, but without more details, it doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nI also see multiple entries with \"None\" in their tasks and some summary events, which might just be part of system logging noise.\n\nPutting this all together, these logs don't show anything out of the ordinary. No signs of malicious activity like failed logins, unknown processes, or access to sensitive areas beyond what's typical for a Windows system during startup and operation. The confidence here is high because each event aligns with expected system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities including process creations and system startup tasks, showing no signs of malicious or unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
