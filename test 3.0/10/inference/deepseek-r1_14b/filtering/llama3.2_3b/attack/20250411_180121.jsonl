{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal because browsers connect to the internet regularly. So that might not be a red flag on its own.\n\nThen I notice several powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities. Let's dig deeper into these events.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe being called with a command line that includes downloading a file from a GitHub URL to the TEMP directory. The path in the command line looks suspicious because it's using $env:TEMP, which is writable by any user and often used for temporary files. Downloading files directly from the internet like this without proper validation can be risky.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is creating files in the TEMP directory with different names, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1. The fact that these files are created and then deleted quickly might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of WebClient's DownloadFile method. This technique is often used in malicious scripts to download arbitrary files, which could be payloads like malware. The URLs point to different GitHub repositories, but using raw.githubusercontent.com isn't inherently bad, but combined with other behaviors, it raises suspicion.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe accesses and modifies the registry (RegistryEvent). This can be normal for script execution, but when combined with other actions like downloading files and creating temporary scripts, it could indicate an attempt to create persistence points or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nAdditionally, there are Pipe Created events from powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might be legitimate, but in the context of these other activities, it's worth monitoring as it can also be a way to hide processes or exfiltrate data.\n\nThe Image Load events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, which could be part of its normal operation. However, if these DLLs are being loaded from unexpected locations or in an unusual sequence, they might be indicators of malicious activity.\n\nI'm also noticing that after creating some files, they're immediately deleted (FileDeleteDetected). This behavior often suggests an attempt to leave no trace, which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection.\n\nFurthermore, the batch includes multiple similar events with different command lines but following the same pattern. This repetition could indicate automated malicious activity or a script trying multiple download attempts from various repositories, possibly testing if certain files can be executed without being noticed.\n\nThe combination of these factors—multiple powershell.exe instances performing network downloads to temporary locations, creating and deleting scripts quickly, modifying registry entries, and loading system DLLs—presents a concerning pattern. These actions don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate the execution of malicious scripts or attempts at persistence.\n\nTherefore, while some individual events might not raise alarms on their own, taken together they suggest potentially harmful activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes and Events:**\n   - The logs contain multiple entries from `chrome.exe` with network connection tasks, which are generally normal for a browser's operation.\n   - Several events involve `powershell.exe`, which is a high-interest process due to its dual-use nature (legitimate scripting vs. potential abuse).\n\n2. **Analyze Powershell Commands:**\n   - The command lines in some powershell.exe events show the use of `WebClient.DownloadFile` method, indicating direct file downloads from GitHub URLs to temporary directories.\n   - These files are named with random-looking strings (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1`), which is atypical and may suggest an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Track File Operations:**\n   - The creation and subsequent deletion of files in the TEMP directory raise suspicion as malicious actors often clean up traces of their activities.\n   - Multiple file creation events with varying names indicate possible scripting or automated behavior, possibly testing different payloads.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Powershell.exe accessing registry entries could be normal for script execution but may also signal attempts to create persistence mechanisms or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\n5. **Pipe and DLL Load Events:**\n   - The creation of pipes by powershell.exe might be part of legitimate communication but can also be used for hiding processes or exfiltration, adding to the concern.\n   - Loading system DLLs is standard but could involve unexpected modules if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\n6. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Repetition of similar events with slight variations in URLs and file names suggests an automated script or testing phase, which is more aligned with malicious intent.\n\n7. **Conclusion on Risk Level:**\n   - While individual actions may not be alarming, the combination of network downloads, temporary file manipulation, registry changes, and repeated scripting points to a high risk of malicious activity.\n   - Further investigation is necessary to determine if these events indicate an actual breach or attack attempt.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits characteristics indicative of potentially malicious activities. The use of powershell.exe for downloading files from external sources, creating temporary scripts, modifying system configurations, and attempting to avoid detection by deleting traces suggests a high risk. Therefore, this incident should be classified as **High Risk**, requiring immediate attention and further investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process with a command line that tries to download something from a GitHub repo into the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because downloading files from untrusted sources can be malicious. The task is 'Engine Lifecycle', which might mean it's part of the process initialization.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where various processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe create files or access registry entries. Not sure if that's normal yet, but I'll keep an eye out for patterns.\n\nI notice a lot of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities. For example, there's a cmd command deleting a scheduled task with SCHTASKS. Then another cmd command trying to delete a registry entry related to the Run key. Also, there are REG.EXE commands modifying the registry. This seems like someone is cleaning up traces of their activity, which could be an indicator of malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at other events: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll – that's normal. Schedtasks.exe accessing taskschd.dll is also standard for task scheduler. The whoami.exe process is just checking user info, not harmful by itself.\n\nBut the combination is concerning. Multiple attempts to delete registry entries and scheduled tasks might mean an attacker is trying to remove persistence mechanisms or erase their footprints. The initial PowerShell download attempt could be part of a larger attack chain, like downloading malicious scripts or tools.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, it's likely indicative of a potential cyberattack. There are signs of system compromise, file downloads from external sources, and attempts to cover tracks by removing traces from the registry and task scheduler.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell downloading files from GitHub, deletion of scheduled tasks, and registry modifications which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell-related activity. There are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' and tasks include things like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, etc. This could be normal user activity or potentially malicious since attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and lateral movement.\n\nThere's also an instance where 'whoami.exe' was executed, which can be used to gather system information. That's a red flag because it might indicate an attempt to discover system details for further attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events from Chrome related to Registry value sets and Pipe Created tasks. While these aren't as immediately suspicious as PowerShell activities, they could still be part of malicious behavior if they're anomalies or occur in unusual volumes.\n\nI see some repeated patterns in the events, such as multiple ImageLoad tasks for the same DLL files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. This repetition might indicate a script being run multiple times, which could be testing or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe presence of temporary PowerShell scripts created (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_*) suggests that some scripting is happening, possibly for policy testing or to avoid detection. These files are often used in malicious activities to execute code without leaving long-term traces.\n\nThere's also a mix of command lines like 'powershell.exe & {}' and 'cmd.exe \/c', which might be indicators of how scripts are being executed or chained together. This kind of activity can be a sign of automated or script-based attacks.\n\nConsidering the overall volume, even though some events aren't overtly malicious on their own, the combination raises concerns about potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of PowerShell with various tasks and the presence of whoami.exe make this batch particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including image loads, file creations, registry modifications, and temporary script files indicate potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with commands that remove files from the TEMP directory. For example, \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip\" and similar commands. These look like attempts to delete specific ZIP files, possibly to clean up traces of previous activities or malicious payloads.\n\nNext, I notice several ImageLoad events related to .NET framework components and Windows Defender DLLs. This could be normal if PowerShell is loading these libraries for legitimate tasks, but it's also common in malware to load such modules to hide their activity or gain persistence.\n\nThere are also Process Create events for both PowerShell and Chrome, along with Registry value sets. The fact that whoami.exe was executed might indicate an attempt to gather user information, which could be part of lateral movement or reconnaissance within the system.\n\nAnother point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a script file in the TEMP directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\". This seems suspicious because creating temporary script files can be a method used by malicious scripts to test execution policies or bypass certain security measures. The quick creation and deletion might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events for PowerShell. Such frequent lifecycle changes could indicate unusual activity, possibly scripting or automation that's trying to stay under the radar.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing deletions in TEMP, loading various modules, creating and deleting a script file, and other system interactions. These activities don't necessarily prove malicious intent on their own, but the combination is concerning. It suggests potential unauthorized access or attempts to cover tracks, which could indicate compromise.\n\nWhile there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, the pattern of events is unusual enough that it warrants closer examination. Therefore, I classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are deleting files in the TEMP directory and interacting with system components, which may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they involve powershell.exe with commands removing files from the TEMP directory. The command lines are using Remove-Item to delete specific .txt files. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously, especially when deleting files which could cover tracks.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is loaded or accessed, and some involve creating new files in user directories. For example, 'File created' events for paths like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_padrao.txt and pacote_ativo.txt. This file creation might be part of malicious activity, perhaps dropping files as part of a payload.\n\nI also notice multiple instances where conhost.exe is used to set registry values. Conhost is often associated with command-line tools and can sometimes be exploited by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThere are events from chrome.exe accessing the registry, which might seem normal, but if these occur frequently without clear justification, they could indicate suspicious activity, especially if combined with other events.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being run. While whoami is a legitimate tool to check user information, repeated executions without an obvious reason could be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement in a network.\n\nAnother point is the file path for MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. If this file was accessed by powershell.exe, it might indicate an attempt to load malicious code into a legitimate process, a common tactic in malware.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating files seems normal if it's part of log management, but without more context, it could be suspicious depending on the environment.\n\nPutting all these together, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that delete files and create new ones, along with other processes accessing registry and file system. These actions are often indicative of malicious behavior such as deletion to remove evidence, file creation for payloads, and registry access for persistence. The repetition and combination of different activities across various processes make this batch significant enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that delete files in the TEMP directory, create new files, and access system resources.
