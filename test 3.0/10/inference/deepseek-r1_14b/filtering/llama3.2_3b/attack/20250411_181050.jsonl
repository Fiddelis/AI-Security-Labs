{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's a process called whoami.exe being run. That's usually a benign command that shows user information. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext up is cmd.exe with a command line that includes certutil and some file operations. Certutil can be used for encoding and decoding files. The command lines here are trying to encode calc.exe into a text file, then decode it back. This seems a bit odd because why would someone want to encode and then immediately decode an executable? It could be a way to obfuscate malicious code.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed but not executed directly. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. The fact that it's just accessed might not be enough on its own.\n\nAnother event shows certutil.exe encoding calc.exe into a text file in the temp directory. Thatâ€™s interesting because using certutil to encode executables is a known technique in malware to avoid detection by antivirus software. Also, calc.exe is being used here, which is a common payload for testing or malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where certutil.exe sets registry values and creates files. The repeated use of certutil and the creation of several temp files with names like modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe stand out. These file names suggest some kind of logical modules being decoded, which could be parts of a larger malicious payload.\n\nThere's also an event where rundll32.exe is used to call PcaSvc.dll, which is related to PC patching tasks. That might be normal, but sometimes these system files can be exploited or used as part of a chain in malware.\n\nAnother event shows Chrome making network connections and setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome can do legitimate things over the network, repeated registry changes could indicate tampering, though it's not conclusive by itself.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe is involved again in creating a file named componente_auxiliar.txt. Powershell is versatile, so this could be anything, but combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together: The use of certutil for encoding and decoding calc.exe multiple times suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated creation of files and registry modifications by these processes are red flags. Additionally, the involvement of powershell.exe and rundll32.exe could be part of a larger attack chain. While individual events might not seem suspicious, the combination points towards possible malware or an attack attempt. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of certutil.exe encoding and decoding files, cmd.exe executing malicious commands, and powershell.exe being accessed, indicating potential malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
