{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve powershell.exe executing commands that create scheduled tasks. The command lines show an attempt to register scheduled tasks with different names, like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"registro_geral\". Each time, it's using calc.exe as the execute action. This seems suspicious because creating multiple scheduled tasks that run at logon, especially with calc.exe, could be part of a persistence mechanism for malware.\n\nThe 'winlog' field shows tasks related to Provider Lifecycle, which is typical when dealing with task scheduler operations. However, the fact that multiple similar events are present suggests an attempt to create several tasks, possibly to ensure persistence even if one gets removed.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe accesses the registry and creates files in temporary directories. For example, a file is created and then deleted shortly after. This could be an indicator of script execution testing permissions or trying to bypass certain security policies. The creation and deletion of \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1\" might indicate that the script was being tested for policy compliance, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, including mscoree.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. While these are legitimate system files, their loading by powershell could be part of executing malicious code or attempting to load modules that might have been altered.\n\nMoreover, the use of BUILTIN\\Administrators as the user group in the scheduled tasks indicates high-level permissions, which is a red flag because such tasks can grant persistent elevated access if they're part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple attempts to create scheduled tasks with different names, registry accesses, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and loading system DLLs. These behaviors collectively point towards potential malicious activity, possibly related to persistence, lateral movement, or payload execution.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities could be legitimate. While some operations might be part of normal script execution, the combination—especially the repeated task creations with calc.exe—unlikely in a benign scenario. Legitimate scripts usually don't create multiple scheduled tasks for testing purposes and wouldn't involve such specific commands.\n\nIn conclusion, this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. The user should investigate these events further, possibly looking into the script content, checking for unauthorized changes to system configurations, and ensuring that all binaries are legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n**Investigation Findings:**\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation Attempts:**\n   - Multiple attempts were made by `powershell.exe` to create scheduled tasks using different names (e.g., \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\"). Each task is set to execute `calc.exe` at logon.\n   - These activities are flagged as suspicious due to the use of a known calculator executable and multiple varied task names, which may indicate an attempt to evade detection or ensure persistence.\n\n2. **Registry Access:**\n   - Events show registry accesses by `powershell.exe`, which could be part of script execution to modify system configurations or gather information.\n   - Such activities without legitimate justification can be indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n3. **File Operations in Temporary Directories:**\n   - A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) was created and immediately deleted by `powershell.exe`.\n   - This pattern suggests a test for script policy compliance, often employed by malware to avoid detection mechanisms.\n\n4. **DLL Loadings:**\n   - The loading of system DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, etc.) by `powershell.exe` is noted.\n   - While these are legitimate files, their context within a suspicious script execution warrants further scrutiny for potential tampering or malicious use.\n\n5. **Use of Elevated Privileges:**\n   - Scheduled tasks created with the `BUILTIN\\Administrators` group suggest high-level permissions access, which is concerning as it could facilitate unauthorized system control.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observed activities strongly indicate potential malicious intent, possibly involving persistence mechanisms, lateral movement, or payload execution. These findings necessitate a thorough investigation into script contents, system configurations, and binary verifications to ensure no compromise has occurred. Immediate actions should include isolating the affected system, reviewing task scheduler entries, and scanning for any signs of malware."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm looking at the entire batch of events provided to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll go through each event one by two to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows a PowerShell command that creates a scheduled task. The script is trying to execute calc.exe at logon with highest privileges. This immediately raises a red flag because using elevated privileges and scheduling tasks can be signs of malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are several events from chrome.exe modifying the registry. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, multiple such events in a row might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not part of normal browsing behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThen I notice a series of \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks from the winlog. These repeated attempts could be an attempt to establish communication with another system or execute code remotely, which is concerning as it might indicate remote control or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking further, there are events where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll and creates a task named 'unidade_comum'. WMI is often used in attacks for persistence, so creating scheduled tasks could be part of setting up persistent malware. The use of 'taskschd.dll' aligns with this.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe modifying the registry and creating a file in the Tasks directory. Svchost is a legitimate process but can also be exploited by malware. Creating files under System32 or Task might be an attempt to hide malicious activities.\n\nThere's also an instance where powershell.exe writes to a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This could be for persistence, as startup folders are common places for scripts to run on login.\n\nAdditionally, conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe events show registry modifications and file operations. Conhost is usually benign but can be used maliciously if compromised.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple scheduled tasks created via PowerShell with elevated privileges, repeated remote command executions,registry modifications by various processes including svchost and chrome, and files being created in sensitive locations. These patterns collectively suggest possible unauthorized access or malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, and potential data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some events could be legitimate (like Chrome registry writes), the combination of PowerShell tasks, remote commands, and multiple process interactions points towards a coordinated attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, repeated remote command executions, and file\/registry modifications by various processes indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each line is a JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is 'Registry value set'. Since Chrome often interacts with the registry, these might be normal activities, especially during updates or configuration changes. The same applies to other standard processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe performing file operations.\n\nI notice that there are seven events involving chrome.exe setting registry values, one DNS query from chrome.exe, a file created by winlogbeat.exe in its own directory, which is likely part of its setup or logging process, and a file created by powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so the creation of 'objeto_auxiliar.txt' could be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, looking at the entire batch, all these events seem to fall within normal operational patterns. There's no evidence of unusual behavior like multiple failed logins, access to restricted files, or changes in user permissions. The file paths are standard and don't indicate exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, while each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the combination doesn't raise any red flags that warrant immediate investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities, including registry updates and file creations by standard processes like Chrome, Winlogbeat, and PowerShell.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
