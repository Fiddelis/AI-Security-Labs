{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to see if they're relevant for investigation. The user has given me a JSONL file with multiple events, each on its own line. My task is to go through all these events as a whole and determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not.\n\nLet me start by looking at each event individually to spot any patterns or red flags.\n\nThe first few lines are about processes starting and accessing things. I see 'powershell.exe' being accessed multiple times, which isn't inherently bad but can be concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Then there's 'whoami.exe' running, which is a common system command to check user information—usually not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where 'powershell.exe' sets registry values. Registry modifications in scripts can be tricky because attackers might use them to persistence or change system configurations. Also, I notice that some PowerShell commands have complex command lines with multiple utilities like net.exe, cmdkey.exe, and others. These command lines include commands such as 'net user', which could retrieve user information, and 'get-localgroupmember' which gets group members—potentially gathering info about the system.\n\nThere's an event where a file is deleted: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1\". The fact that it's deleting a script file might indicate something was run and then cleaned up, which could be part of malicious activity to erase traces.\n\nI also see 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. That seems legitimate since winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting Windows logs, so probably not suspicious.\n\nPutting this together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running scripts that perform system queries, modifying the registry, and deleting files. The repeated use of net.exe and cmdkey.exe might be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation. Additionally, the command lines are obfuscated or complex, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because these activities could indicate potential malicious behavior like unauthorized access, data gathering, or system configuration changes. The confidence isn't super high (maybe 0.7) because some of the actions could be part of legitimate scripts or administrative tasks, but the combination is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe running suspicious commands, including system queries and file deletions, along with other tools that may indicate unauthorized access.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The user wants just one classification and justification for the whole batch.\n\nLooking at each event, I notice several PowerShell.exe processes with various commands. For example, there's a command line that includes net user, get-localuser, and other cmdlets which might be used to gather system information. This could indicate reconnaissance activity, which is a red flag.\n\nThere are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing files, creating them, or interacting with the registry. Registry interactions can sometimes be part of persistence mechanisms, so that's something to note.\n\nI also see other executables like cmdkey.exe and net1.exe being run. These aren't inherently malicious, but their use alongside PowerShell might raise suspicions, especially if they're part of a script meant to hide malicious actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries for svchost.exe accessing the registry. While svchost is a legitimate process, it's often used by malware because it's signed by Microsoft, making it harder to detect. The combination here could suggest potential malicious activity.\n\nThere are some benign activities too, like Calculator.exe loading a DLL and winlogbeat creating files, which are likely just normal operations or log gathering for monitoring purposes.\n\nOverall, the batch shows extensive PowerShell usage with commands that can gather system info and possibly modify system configurations. This pattern is often indicative of attacker behavior during an intrusion. The presence of multiple process creations and file\/registry interactions further supports this. While not all events are malicious on their own, together they create a concerning pattern that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe processes with commands indicating potential system reconnaissance and manipulation (e.g., net user, get-localuser, cmdkey.exe).
