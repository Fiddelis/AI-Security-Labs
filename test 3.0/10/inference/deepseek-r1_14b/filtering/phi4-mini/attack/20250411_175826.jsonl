{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. First, I notice there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can do both legitimate and malicious tasks.\n\nLooking at the command lines in the process entries, they all seem similarâ€”they're using Get-ChildItem to access files and then setting LastWriteTime to a very old date (January 1, 1970). This kind of activity could be an attempt to manipulate file timestamps, which is a common tactic in malware to hide its tracks or make files look less suspicious.\n\nAnother point is that these commands are executed through powershell.exe with ampersands, which allows chaining commands. The paths in the command lines vary, but they all target different files across various directories. This widespread targeting might indicate a broader campaign or tool being used to modify multiple files.\n\nI also see events where files were created and then immediately deleted. That's another red flag because attackers often create temporary files and delete them quickly to avoid detection. The file paths point to locations in the user's AppData folder, which is common for storing user-specific data, making it a target for malicious activities aiming to stay under the radar.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and modifies registry values. These actions can be part of establishing persistence or altering system configurations to facilitate further attacks.\n\nWhile some entries look suspicious on their own, especially the repeated use of powershell with these command lines, I need to consider if this is within normal user behavior. However, given that these activities are designed to manipulate file times and delete evidence quickly, it's unlikely to be legitimate user activity. The combination of multiple powershell executions, file timestamp changes, and deletions strengthens the case for potential malicious intent.\n\nI should also note that the batch includes events from other processes like chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, but these don't seem to contribute directly to any concerning behavior except for one registry event with RuntimeBroker, which might be normal. The notepad.exe entry accessing the registry could also be part of legitimate operations, so it's probably not a major concern on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated and varied use of powershell with these specific commands suggests possible malicious activity aimed at modifying file metadata and cleaning up evidence, making this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided events reveals several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Powershell Execution**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executed with command lines that use `Get-ChildItem` to access files and set their `LastWriteTime` to January 1, 1970. This behavior is often used by attackers to manipulate file timestamps for evading detection.\n\n2. **File Deletion**: Temporary files created in the AppData folder are deleted immediately, which is a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence behind.\n\n3. **Variety of Target Paths**: The commands target various directories and files, suggesting a broader campaign or tool deployment.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Events show powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values, possibly for persistence or system configuration changes.\n\n5. **Suspicious Command Chaining**: Use of ampersands in command lines indicates chaining of commands, typical in scripting to carry out multiple actions.\n\nWhile normal user activities can sometimes involve powershell, the combination of timestamp manipulation, file deletion, and varied targeting makes this batch suspicious. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to assess if these events are part of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events indicate potential malicious behavior, particularly due to the use of powershell for file manipulation and evidence deletion. This batch is deemed interesting for cybersecurity investigation purposes."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where the process is 'svchost.exe' with tasks related to registry value sets. Svchost is a common Windows process that can be part of legitimate services, but it's also often used by malware because multiple services run under this name. However, in this case, there are multiple instances of svchost.exe making registry changes, which could indicate something suspicious, like potential persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nThen, I see several powershell.exe processes with command lines that involve modifying file last write times. The command line arguments show Get-ChildItem being used to target specific files and then setting their LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". This is a classic tactic used in malware to make files appear older, possibly to avoid detection by tools that look for recently modified files. This behavior stands out as potentially malicious because it's unusual for legitimate processes to modify file timestamps in this way.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is accessing registry values and loading system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these could be normal operations for Chrome, the frequency of RegistryEvent tasks might indicate some form of activity monitoring or injection, which could be suspicious if part of broader malicious behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there are instances where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates files in its own directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for collecting Windows logs, but seeing it creating new files might not be unusual unless the files are being used maliciously, like storing data that shouldn't be there or if the creation pattern is irregular.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'conhost.exe', which is another standard Windows process. Its involvement here doesn't immediately raise a red flag on its own, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger scheme.\n\nI also notice 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' accessing registry values. While they are benign applications, their interaction with the registry might be part of an attempt to modify system settings or load malicious components, especially if these actions are unexpected in the context of the user's activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of powershell.exe to alter file timestamps is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The combination of svchost.exe making registry changes and chrome.exe accessing registry values could be part of a campaign to maintain persistence or facilitate further attacks. The actions taken by winlogbeat.exe might not be suspicious on their own but could be part of an attacker's tools for log manipulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of powershell.exe modifying file times and multiple processes accessing or altering system settings via registry entries suggests that this batch of events is indeed concerning and worth investigating further. These behaviors don't definitively prove malicious intent, but they do raise significant red flags that warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several concerning activities that suggest potential malicious behavior:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activity:** The use of powershell.exe to modify file timestamps by setting them to \"01\/01\/1970\" is a red flag, often used by malware to avoid detection.\n\n2. **Svchost.exe Registry Modifications:** Multiple instances of svchost.exe making registry changes could indicate persistence mechanisms or unauthorized system modifications.\n\n3. **Chrome.exe Behavior:** The frequent access to registry values and loading of DLLs might suggest activity monitoring or injection, which is suspicious in combination with other activities.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat.exe File Creation:** While winlogbeat is legitimate, the creation of files in its directory could be part of log manipulation, warranting further investigation.\n\n5. **Conhost.exe and Calculator.exe Interaction:** These processes accessing registry values might indicate unexpected system modifications or component loading.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events are considered interesting for investigation due to the potential indicators of malicious activity, particularly the powershell.exe command-line activities and svchost.exe registry manipulations. These actions suggest a possible security threat that requires further analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events provided in JSONL format. Let me go through each event one by one and then consider the entire batch together.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\unidade_logico.txt. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. Creating a new file might be part of an attack chain, like downloading malware or writing logs for lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the next seven events, they all come from chrome.exe and involve setting registry values. Each event mentions that a registry value was set, but no specific details about which key or what changed. While modifying the registry is something legitimate applications do, especially browsers managing settings, multiple identical events in quick succession might be suspicious. It could indicate tampering with system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI should consider the combination of these events. The powershell activity stands out because it's a process often associated with scripting and can execute commands that are hard to trace. The fact that it created a file might not be enough on its own, but combined with multiple registry changes from chrome.exe, which is unexpected in this context, raises concerns.\n\nAnother point is the frequency of events. Nine entries in total, seven being the same type from chrome.exe. This could suggest automated or malicious activity trying to establish persistence across system restarts or user logins by modifying the registry repeatedly.\n\nI should also think about potential scenarios where these actions might be legitimate versus malicious. For instance, if a user is running powershell for administrative tasks and chrome is updating settings, but given that both events are happening in the same batch and involve sensitive operations (file creation and registry changes), it's more concerning.\n\nIn terms of confidence, while I'm not certain without more context, the combination does raise enough red flags to warrant further investigation. The use of powershell for file creation and multiple registry writes from chrome.exe don't align with typical user behavior, making the batch INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a PowerShell process creating a file and multiple instances of Chrome setting registry values. This combination could indicate potential malicious activity, such as script execution or system configuration tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
