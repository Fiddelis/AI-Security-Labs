Processes named 'powershell.exe' are showing up multiple times with various tasks like Process Create, Registry value sets, and Image loads. Notably, the command line includes search patterns for sensitive keywords like \"pass\" across different file types. This could indicate data exfiltration or credential harvesting.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands raises suspicions because attackers often use this tool for lateral movement and executing malicious scripts. The creation and deletion of temporary script files in the Windows Temp directory also stand out. Creating a file and then deleting it shortly after might be an attempt to avoid detection or remove evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where the same PowerShell command is run repeatedly under different tasks. This could suggest automated behavior, possibly part of a script designed to evade detection mechanisms.\n\nWhile some legitimate use of PowerShell exists, such as system administration tasks, the combination here—especially the repeated search for \"pass\" in sensitive file types and temporary file handling—is concerning. It's more indicative of malicious activity than normal operations.\n\nI don't see any clear indicators that this is a false positive or normal user behavior. The actions taken could potentially lead to unauthorized access or data loss, making the batch highly relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line arguments searching for sensitive keywords in various file types, along with the creation and deletion of temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's an event where svchost.exe set a registry value. Svchost is a common system process, so that might be normal unless it's doing something unusual. Next, Calculator.exe loaded the urlmon.dll file. That seems standard since it's part of Windows.\n\nThen, findstr.exe was run with a command searching for \"pass\" in various files. That could be suspicious because it's looking for password-related terms across multiple file types. This might indicate someone is trying to gather sensitive information.\n\nAfter that, OfficeClickToRun.exe made a DNS query. Not sure if that's concerning on its own, but combined with other activities, it's worth noting.\n\nA PowerShell command was executed using findstr to search for \"password\" in files and then selecting strings matching the pattern. This is definitely a red flag because it's directly related to password extraction. Using Powershell can be a common tactic for attackers due to its scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe created files and modified registry values. This could indicate persistence mechanisms or attempts to alter system configurations. Additionally, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and Calculator.exe also modifying registry values might not be inherently bad, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it raises questions.\n\nThere's a lot of activity from chrome.exe, including multiple DNS queries, file loads, and network connections. While Chrome is a common browser, such extensive logging could suggest either normal usage or potential abuse, especially if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe last few events show winlogbeat.exe creating a file and chrome.exe accessing various system files and making network connections. Winlogbeat is likely related to log management, but the overall picture seems to involve multiple processes with potentially malicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several signs that might indicate malicious behavior: searching for passwords using findstr and Powershell, registry modifications by multiple processes, and extensive Chrome activity which could be part of a botnet or command-and-control communication. These factors make the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities such as password-related searches using findstr.exe, PowerShell commands with potentially malicious intent, and multiple registry modifications, which may indicate unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. That seems unusual because Chrome typically doesn't do a lot of registry changes on its own. Could be malicious activity or just some legitimate update mechanism, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen, there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' creating files and accessing processes. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so any use here could be red flags. The fact that it's creating files in user directories might indicate file persistence or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nLooking at the schtasks.exe entries, there are process creations with command lines deleting specific task names. Scheduled tasks being deleted can be a sign of an attempt to remove traces or disrupt system functionality. This could be part of a broader attack strategy to cover tracks.\n\nThe 'svchost.exe' making registry changes is concerning too. Svchost is commonly used by legitimate services, but it's also a favorite for malware to hide under. Registry modifications here might be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\nThere are also instances of 'cmd.exe' executing commands like deleting notepad.exe processes and using WMIC for process deletion. Using command-line tools to delete processes can be indicative of attempts to terminate legitimate programs, possibly to prevent logging or interfere with system operations.\n\nThe repeated use of various executables (powershell, cmd, schtasks) with specific command lines raises the suspicion that these are part of a coordinated attack. The combination of file creation, registry changes, process deletion, and task manipulation suggests potential malicious activities such as persistence, data theft, or system disruption.\n\nWhile some actions could be benign, the volume and variety of potentially suspicious events make this batch stand out. Each individual event might not be alarming on its own, but together they paint a concerning picture that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of processes like PowerShell and schtasks.exe performing actions such as file creation and registry modifications, which could indicate potential malicious activity or system tampering.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"WMIC.exe\" with tasks indicating image loading. WMIC is known for its remote command execution capabilities, which can be a red flag, especially when combined with other activities. The files loaded here are system32 DLLs, which aren't unusual on their own but could be part of malicious activity.\n\nNext, I see several \"powershell.exe\" entries with tasks like Registry value set and Process accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused for attacks. The repeated access to processes might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThere are also multiple instances of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, and whoami.exe being executed. These tools are commonly used in command-line attacks. For example, the cmd.exe commands with \"\/c net user \/del\" suggest attempts to delete user accounts, which could be part of an attack aiming to remove traces or disrupt system access.\n\nThe consistent use of \"\/del\" and \"\/domain\" in these commands stands out. Deleting users across the domain might indicate a broader attack attempting to compromise multiple accounts or disrupt services within an Active Directory environment. This level of activity is concerning as it shows potential destructive intent.\n\nLooking at the process creation events, especially with command-line arguments, there's a pattern of trying to remove administrative accounts. This could be part of an attempt to erase evidence or disable security mechanisms. The repetition of these commands over multiple entries suggests a concerted effort rather than isolated incidents.\n\nWhile some activities might seem benign on their own, the combination—especially the repeated and varied attempts to delete users using different tools—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. This pattern isn't typical of normal user activity and raises suspicions of an attack aimed at compromising system integrity or access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of processes attempting to delete user accounts, including use of WMIC.exe, PowerShell, cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe with deletion commands.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are being executed. For example, one event shows cmd.exe running with the command \"sc delete win32times\". I know that 'sc' is a tool used to manage services in Windows, so deleting a service could be legitimate or malicious depending on context.\n\nLooking further, there's another cmd.exe instance where it's trying to delete files in the Temp directory. The command line shows \"\/c del %temp%...\", which deletes specific files. This might indicate an attempt to remove traces of previous activities, which is often a sign of malicious behavior because attackers don't want to leave evidence.\n\nPowershell.exe appears several times too. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities. The events show powershell.exe being accessed and modifying the registry. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, where malware ensures it runs on each startup. For example, adding or deleting registry keys to maintain access.\n\nThere are also instances where 'services.exe' modifies the registry. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's making unusual registry changes, that could be suspicious. Similarly, conhost.exe and whoami.exe are being used. Conhost.exe is often associated with command-line tools and might not inherently be malicious, but in combination with other actions, it could raise flags.\n\nAnother thing I spot is the use of 'whoami.exe', which typically retrieves user information. It's usually innocent, but if it's part of a larger sequence of events leading to privilege escalation or lateral movement, that would be concerning.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple powershell.exe instances with command lines like \"& {}\", which seems odd. Powershell commands ending with \"&\" sometimes indicate attempts to execute other scripts or commands, possibly for obfuscation or to run malicious code.\n\nThe file deletion event in cmd.exe caught my attention because it's explicitly removing files from the Temp directory. Malicious actors often clean up after themselves to avoid detection. The specific filenames mentioned, like \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\", seem arbitrary but might be part of a cleanup routine for malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple instances of process creation, registry modifications, file deletions, and powershell usage—especially with command-line arguments that aren't clearly benign. These behaviors are common in attack patterns, such as lateral movement, persistence, data exfiltration, or cleanup after an infection.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of these activities suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal user operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple process creations, registry modifications, and file deletions involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe, which are indicative of potentially malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or evidence cleanup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"High\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. I'm not an expert, but I'll walk through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are related to PowerShell.exe and other standard processes like whoami.exe, calc.exe, conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, etc. The tasks include things like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, Process Create, and others.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: They're all from powershell.exe, showing that images are being loaded and files are being created or deleted in temporary directories. For example, one event shows a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 being created and then deleted. That seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also an entry where powershell.exe accesses other processes multiple times. This repeated access might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other running processes, which could be part of malicious activity or legitimate scripting.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files in different locations, like under AppData and ProgramData. The fact that these are temporary files and startup profile data makes me think about persistence mechanisms. Attackers often use such locations to store scripts or configurations for long-term access.\n\nThe whoami.exe processes being created could be part of information gathering. Since whoami is a tool used to determine user permissions, repeated execution might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gather system info.\n\nLooking at the calc.exe event loading urlmon.dll—that's a standard DLL, so not immediately suspicious on its own. But combined with other events, it might not add much unless there's something else indicating malicious activity.\n\nConhost.exe accessing registry values and notepad.exe doing the same could be part of legitimate operations or could also be hiding malicious activities within normal processes.\n\nThere's also a lot of 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe. This repeated interaction with other processes might be an attempt to gain more permissions or execute commands that require higher privileges.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while individually some actions aren't alarming, the combination—especially the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts, multiple process accesses, and use of whoami.exe—could indicate malicious behavior. It's possible that someone is trying to run a script that gets deleted to avoid detection or is using legitimate tools in an abusive way.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to be certain. These actions could also be part of normal scripting or system administration tasks. But the repeated and varied use of powershell.exe along with other processes like whoami.exe raises enough flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities related to PowerShell, including temporary file creation\/deletion, process access patterns, and use of tools like whoami.exe, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is svchost.exe with a registry value being set. Svchost.exe is known to be legitimate for various Windows services, but it can also be used by malware because many processes run under this name. The repeated registry writes could indicate something malicious, like setting up persistence or configuration changes.\n\nNext, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so if that's expected behavior, it might not be suspicious on its own. But I should check if this instance was installed correctly and if the file creation aligns with normal operations.\n\nThen, there are two entries involving powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and script runs. The access could mean legitimate administration tasks or malicious activities. It's something that requires closer look.\n\nAn event from whoami.exe running without any arguments stands out too. Whoami is usually harmless, but its use might be part of a process to gather information about the system. If there are multiple such events, it could indicate recon activity.\n\nLooking further, ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry isn't unusual as it's related to Windows Shell services. But again, repeated writes might warrant attention.\n\nMost of the other entries are from chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. While this is normal for a browser, multiple connections or unexpected domains could be concerning, but in this case, without specific URLs, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe's activity stands out because it's recurring and involves registry changes. The powershell.exe accesses are also notable. However, without clear signs of malicious behavior like known bad file hashes or unusual network traffic, the batch doesn't strongly indicate an active threat. It might be a false positive or normal admin tasks.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards this being not particularly interesting, but there are red flags that could merit further investigation if other data points support it.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and network connections which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
