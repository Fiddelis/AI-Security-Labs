{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break down the events step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where `chrome.exe` is making network connections and performing DNS queries. That in itself isn't unusual because Chrome is a browser that typically connects to the internet and resolves domains. So these events don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nNext, I notice several events related to `powershell.exe`. The first event shows PowerShell setting a registry value. Then, there's a process creation event with a command line that includes various commands like net user, get-localuser, etc. This command line seems suspicious because it's executing multiple cmdlets in one go, which could be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking deeper into the command line:\n- `net user` might be used to list users.\n- `get-localgroupmember -group Users` suggests checking membership in the Users group.\n- `cmdkey.exe \/list` is used to retrieve stored credentials, like those for network shares.\n- Commands like `ls C:\/Users`, `dir C:\\Users`, and `net localgroup` indicate file system access and group enumeration.\n\nMoreover, PowerShell creates a temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1`), which is then deleted shortly after. This behavior could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies by testing script execution in a low-impact way before executing more malicious code.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line might indicate that the script is being run multiple times or that there's some loop involved, possibly trying different things each time.\n\nAdditionally, there are several image load events from PowerShell loading various .NET and native images. While this isn't inherently suspicious, it does show that PowerShell is executing code that might be part of a larger payload.\n\nThe fact that both Chrome and PowerShell activities are present in the logs doesn't necessarily mean they're related. However, the specific commands executed by PowerShell stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity. The combination of registry modifications, file system access, credential dumping attempts, and temporary script creation\/deletion is concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events individually might not be alarming, the pattern of activities from PowerShell suggests potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activity involving powershell.exe executing potentially harmful commands, including user enumeration and credential dumping. Additionally, it creates and deletes a temporary script file, which may indicate an attempt to bypass security policies.\",\n  \"score\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's part of the logging setup.\n\nNext, there's a powershell command line with a script involving net user and other commands. This caught my attention because powershell is often used for malicious activities. The script appears to be gathering user information, which might be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nThen, powershell.exe loading an image, which is standard but combined with the previous event, it's worth monitoring.\n\nA process create event for net.exe checking users—again, this could be normal admin activity, but when paired with other powershell activities, it raises a flag.\n\nMultiple events show powershell accessing processes and creating files. The file creation in different user directories is concerning—it might indicate data exfiltration or setting up persistence points.\n\nThere are several registry writes by chrome.exe. While that's unusual, chrome does sometimes make registry changes, so not immediately suspicious unless combined with other anomalies.\n\nOther entries like SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and updater.exe running seem normal for system processes.\n\nI notice repeated use of powershell with different command lines, especially involving net and cmdkey. These tools are common in attacks, so the combination is a red flag. Also, creating multiple files in user directories could be setting up persistence or storing malicious data.\n\nConsidering all together, there's a pattern suggesting potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't very high because some events might be legitimate, but the overall behavior indicates possible investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing commands that include gathering user information and list local groups, which could indicate potential malicious activity or reconnaissance.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where conhost.exe set a registry value. That might be normal since conhost is often used in Windows for console processes, but sometimes it's also associated with malicious activities like running scripts without a window. Not sure yet.\n\nNext up is SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. I'm not too familiar with SDXHelper, but URLMON.DLL is part of the Windows shell and handles URLs. Maybe this is just normal operation, but could be suspicious if combined with other events.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own directory for configuration. Winlogbeat is likely a log forwarding tool, so creating config files makes sense. Probably benign.\n\nAfter that, powershell.exe creates modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful. Creating a file could be part of script execution or data collection. This might raise an eyebrow but isn't conclusive on its own.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe runs with some command-line arguments for update checks. That sounds normal; Edge updates often run in the background. No red flags here.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common process, so this could be legitimate or part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate loads taskschd.dll again. Task scheduler-related DLLs are standard for updates and scheduled tasks. Nothing unusual.\n\nPowershell.exe sets another registry value. Combined with the earlier file creation, this might indicate some script activity that's writing to both files and the registry—could be part of data exfiltration or persistence.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe accesses a process, which is common if it's running scripts or interacting with other processes. But again, without context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting all together: multiple powershell events are present. One creates a file, another sets registry values, and one accesses a process. These could be indicators of malicious activity since PowerShell is often abused. Also, the creation of modulo_base.txt might suggest data collection or exfiltration. The other events seem normal but not alarming on their own.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the powershell activities could indicate an attack. However, I'm not entirely certain without more context. Maybe there's a chance it's legitimate admin work. My confidence is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe, which created files and modified registry values, potentially indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
