That seems normal since these are part of the antivirus system. The repeated file creations and image loads don't raise red flags on their own.\n\nLooking at Discord.exe, it's accessing processes multiple times and making network connections. Discord is a known app that connects to servers, so these activities are expected and not unusual. However, there are several entries where the process accessed itself—ProcessAccess events. This could indicate something malicious if it's trying to elevate privileges or inject code.\n\nThe command line in one of the events shows reg.exe querying the Run key for Discord. That's concerning because attackers often use registry keys to maintain persistence. It suggests someone might be checking if Discord is set to run at startup, which could be part of a malicious routine.\n\nOn the other hand, most activities like file creation by winlogbeat.exe and ImageLoad events are standard and don't indicate anything suspicious. The Pipe Created events in Discord are typical for inter-process communication.\n\nConsidering all these points together: while there's some potentially concerning activity with ProcessAccess and reg.exe, it doesn't provide enough context to conclude malicious intent definitively. It might just be normal behavior, especially since the other activities align with expected system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly related to normal Windows Defender processes and Discord activity, including network connections and process access, which do not indicate malicious behavior.

Most of them are from Discord.exe performing various actions like creating pipes, accessing processes, making network connections, and querying DNS. These seem normal for a running Discord application.\n\nHowever, there's an event where reg.exe is used to modify the registry, specifically adding an entry to HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the path pointing to Discord's Update.exe. This could indicate an attempt to run Discord on startup, which might be legitimate but sometimes is a tactic in malware for persistence.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\modules\\discord_dispatch-1\\discord_dispatch\\index.js.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events from a user's system logs. All the events are related to Discord.exe processes. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: It's a file creation under Discord's modules folder. That seems normal because when an application starts, it might load its modules. \n\nNext, there's a process create event with command line details. This is typical for any application starting, especially Discord which might have multiple processes or GPU-specific tasks.\n\nThen I see several \"Process accessed\" events without any file data. These are common in Windows logs when a process interacts with other processes, perhaps checking if they're running.\n\nImage load events for various DLLs and node files. Again, normal operations as Discord loads its dependencies and modules.\n\nThere's also a registry value set event. Applications often modify the registry for settings or preferences, so this isn't unusual unless it's accessing unexpected keys.\n\nI notice network connection detections—Discord being a communication app would connect to servers, so multiple network events are expected.\n\nFile creation time changes in the user's AppData Roaming Discord folder. Temporary files are common for apps handling data, especially when syncing or caching information.\n\nPutting it all together: All these activities are standard for Discord running on a system. No signs of unusual behavior like access to restricted areas, failed logins, or unexpected file modifications outside its app directories. The events follow the typical lifecycle of starting, loading modules, accessing processes, and connecting to networks, which is expected for a legitimate application.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't indicate any malicious activity. It's just Discord running normally.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the normal operation of the Discord application, including process creation, file access, and network connections, which do not indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows Discord.exe changing the file creation time of a temporary file in the Discord Network folder. That seems normal because applications often need to manage their files, including updating metadata. The second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is likely part of the log management system, so this is standard behavior.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where Discord.exe accesses processes without any associated file information. I'm thinking these could be routine process checks or perhaps related to Discord's internal operations. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye out for frequency or patterns.\n\nThen, I notice a lot of Network connection detected events from Discord.exe. This makes me think about whether Discord is making many connections, which might be normal if the user is active on multiple servers or using voice chat. However, the sheer number could also indicate something malicious, like data exfiltration or botnet activity.\n\nLooking at other processes, smartscreen.exe loading urlmon.dll and taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll seem benign. These are standard system processes interacting with known DLLs.\n\nThere's another event where Discord changes the creation time of a different temporary file, similar to the first one. This repetition could be part of how Discord handles its network data, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, most events relate to Discord.exe performing routine operations. The high number of network connections stands out, but without additional signs like unusual bandwidth usage or encryption, I'm not sure if it's malicious. It could just be normal Discord activity. However, the frequency might warrant closer monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch primarily consists of routine activities by Discord.exe, such as file operations and network connections, which do not indicate malicious behavior. While multiple events are present, they align with expected operations for a running Discord application.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing some system activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the logs are from \"Discord.exe\". There are multiple entries where Discord is detected making network connections and accessing processes. That's a lot—like over 15 events just for network connections. Since Discord is a common application, especially among users, it's normal for it to establish connections, download updates, or interact with servers. But the sheer number here makes me wonder if something's off.\n\nThen there are a few entries from other processes like \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating files and \"sppsvc.exe\" loading system DLLs. Those seem pretty benign because winlogbeat is likely logging software, and sppsvc is part of Windows handling updates or licenses. The registry change by svchost.exe also doesn't raise any immediate red flags since that's a common system process.\n\nLooking deeper into the Discord events, there are file creation time changes in specific cache directories. That could be normal for an application updating its files or optimizing performance, but it's worth considering if this frequency is unusual. The paths mentioned like \"Network\" and \"Service Worker CacheStorage\" seem related to how Discord handles data transfers and caching, so they might not be malicious on their own.\n\nHowever, the repetition of similar events from the same process (Discord.exe) could indicate something suspicious, such as a botnet activity or an unusual number of connections. But without seeing additional indicators like failed logins, access to restricted files, or irregular patterns in timing, it's hard to say for sure. Also, since Discord is known for its network-heavy operations, the volume might just be standard usage.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether these events correlate with any known attack vectors. For example, if there were signs of unauthorized processes or writes to sensitive areas, that would be more concerning. But in this batch, everything points to legitimate activities, albeit a lot of them from Discord.\n\nThe lack of any file operations beyond creation times and network connections makes me lean towards it not being malicious. If there were attempts to write to system files, execute scripts, or communicate over unusual ports, that would change my assessment. But here, the actions are within expected behaviors for an active application like Discord.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the volume is high and could warrant monitoring, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity in this batch. It might just be normal operation with a lot of network traffic from Discord.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are primarily related to normal operations of Discord.exe, such as network connections and file activities, which do not indicate malicious behavior. Other processes like winlogbeat.exe and sppsvc.exe are performing legitimate tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
