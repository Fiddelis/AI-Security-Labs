{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst up, there are a couple of events related to Microsoft Edge updates. It looks like the EdgeUpdateInstaller is creating files like setup.exe. That seems normal since updates often involve creating temporary files during installation.\n\nThen there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. I know that CompatTelRunner is part of Windows Update and MpOAV is related to antivirus features, so this shouldn't be suspicious.\n\nNext, setup.exe creates a pipe. Pipes are commonly used for interprocess communication, which isn't unusual. It might be setting up some kind of update process.\n\nServices.exe logon events are normal because services run under system accounts or other principals. The special logon and user account management tasks also seem routine—Windows handles these all the time during startup and operation.\n\nLooking further down, there's a taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which makes sense since Task Scheduler uses this DLL. svchost.exe modifying registry values is also standard; svchost runs various services that might update their registry entries.\n\nThe interesting part comes when I see powershell.exe being called with an execution policy of Restricted. The command line tries to read .inf files and checks for specific patterns in them. This could be legitimate, but using PowerShell with restricted policies can sometimes indicate attempts to hide malicious activity or run scripts that might have不良 intentions. However, since it's checking for certain sections in INF files, maybe it's part of a system scan or update process.\n\nThere are multiple registry events from svchost.exe and powershell.exe, which again could be normal, but combined with the previous PowerShell command, I'm starting to pay more attention.\n\nThe creation of a .yml file by winlogbeat.exe seems related to log shipping tools, so that's probably not an issue. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is also standard for certain operations like handling URLs or protocols.\n\nFinally, svchost.exe creating the BthAvctpSvc service and chrome.exe modifying registry entries are both normal activities.\n\nPutting it all together, while most events are routine, the PowerShell command stands out. It's querying INI files which might be part of a system check, but given that it's looking for specific sections related to installers (likeamd64 or x86), this could indicate something trying to detect or interact with existing installations. This behavior is more concerning because it could be part of a payload checking the environment before deploying malicious actions.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because of the potential malicious intent in the PowerShell command. However, there's uncertainty because such activities can also be legitimate. My confidence is around 0.7 because while it's concerning, it's not definitive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\n**Confidence Level: 0.7**\n\nThe batch of events contains several routine system operations, including updates, service management, and process creation. Notably, the PowerShell command with a restricted execution policy is flagged as potentially concerning. This script reads .inf files and checks for specific sections, which might indicate an attempt to gather or manipulate system information, possibly malicious in nature. While this behavior could also be legitimate, it raises enough suspicion to warrant closer investigation. Therefore, the batch is classified as interesting with a confidence level of 0.7.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Suspicious Activity:** The PowerShell command's purpose and the sections it checks in .inf files suggest potential malicious intent.\n- **Routine Activities:** Most other events are standard system operations, reducing immediate concern.\n- **Uncertainty:** The script's exact purpose is unclear, leaving room for both benign and malicious interpretations."}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because Windows processes often load system DLLs. Next, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory—that looks like the setup process for an application, probably legitimate.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe also loads taskschd.dll. Again, that's a standard action. Then, svchost.exe is creating files related to Delivery Optimization. Svchost is a common system process, and those files seem part of normal Windows updates or optimizations.\n\nAnother svchost event creates a file with a long GUID in the Cache folder. This looks like typical caching behavior for network-related services. The next one creates a content.phf file, which again seems standard for how Windows handles cached data.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an exe file in its Download folder is normal when Edge is updating or installing new versions. MpCmdRun.exe loading files from the Windows Defender directory is expected as it's part of antivirus operations.\n\nThere's an event where MicrosoftEdgeUpdate deletes a specific .exe file, which could be part of cleanup after an update. Then, MpCmdRun creates a lock file in Temp, which is usual for processes needing exclusive access.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values might indicate some CLI activity; perhaps someone used a terminal to run commands. Git creating multiple files in node_modules directories suggests a developer is working on a project, cloning or updating repositories.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are standard system operations—processes loading DLLs, file creations\/deletions by legitimate apps like Edge and Defender, and normal git activity. There's no indication of unusual behavior, missing components, or signs of compromise. All activities align with expected user actions on a system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are typical system operations including process loads, file creations\/deletions, and legitimate application behaviors.

Each line is a JSON object representing an event on the system. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, all the events have \"git.exe\" as the process name. That suggests that Git is being used or something related to it is running. Git is commonly used for version control, so this could be a developer environment or someone working on code.\n\nEach event has a task of \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means a file was created. The files are all located in the path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\semver\\functions\\. The filenames vary, but they include things like compare-loose.js, compare.js, diff.js, eq.js, and so on. There's also index.js.\n\nThe directory structure looks familiar. \"node_modules\" is a common folder in Node.js applications where third-party libraries are stored. So this seems to be part of a project using Node.js modules. The specific module here is semver, which stands for semantic versioning. Semver is used to manage software versions according to the semantic versioning scheme (like 1.2.3).\n\nSo each event represents a file being created under the semver package's functions directory. This is typical during development when dependencies are installed or when modules are updated. Git might be part of this process, perhaps running some scripts after installing new packages.\n\nLooking at all these events together, it seems like someone is setting up or updating their project's dependencies. The fact that multiple files are being created in the semver module suggests that maybe a new version was installed or the module was reinstalled.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting for investigation: since these are normal file creation events during package installation, especially if the user is working with Node.js and Git, there's no indication of any malicious activity. It doesn't show signs of unauthorized access, unusual file paths, or other red flags that would suggest an attack.\n\nHowever, I should consider if \"git.exe\" being involved could mean something else. Maybe it's part of a script or automated process, but without more context, there's no reason to suspect foul play here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the events are related to installing or updating a Node.js module (semver) in a project managed with Git. This is a routine activity for developers and doesn't indicate any security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch represents normal file creation events related to installing or updating the 'semver' Node.js package during development, which is not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, the user has provided a bunch of JSONL entries where each line represents an event. All these events seem to be from the same process: git.exe. Each event reports that a file was created under a specific path related to the node_modules folder in a directory named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The files being created include various JavaScript files and package.json, which are typical for npm modules.\n\nHmm, why would creating these files be notable? Well, git.exe is commonly used for version control. So, it's possible that someone is cloning or pulling a repository into this directory. Node_modules usually contains third-party libraries used in Node.js projects, so semver is one such package related to semantic versioning.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The events are straightforward file creations by git.exe in a standard location for npm modules. There's no indication of unusual processes, access to restricted files, or other red flags that might suggest an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nSo, considering all the events together, it looks like normal operation during a development workflow. No anomalies detected.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during npm package installations or repository cloning.

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst off, all the events have the same process name: git.exe. That means whatever is happening is related to Git, which is a version control system. The task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so it's about files being created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within a directory named \"node_modules\". I remember that node_modules is where Node.js packages are stored when you install them using npm. So these events seem to be part of someone installing or updating their Node.js modules.\n\nEach event shows different files being created, like package.json, index.js, README.md, and others. These are standard files you'd expect in a Node.js module directory. For example, package.json is where dependencies and metadata about the package are stored, while README.md usually contains documentation or instructions for using the package.\n\nSince all these events are related to Git creating files within node_modules, it looks like someone is working on a Node.js project. They might be cloning a repository, installing dependencies, or updating existing modules. None of these actions in themselves indicate malicious activity. Installing new packages is something a developer would regularly do.\n\nI don't see any red flags here, like access to sensitive files, unusual file names, or activities outside the scope of normal development. The pattern matches expected behavior when setting up or working on a Node.js project using Git.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch isn't particularly interesting from a security standpoint. It's more about standard development activities than anything malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show files being created by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during Node.js package installations or updates and does not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a set of JSONL events, each representing some system activity. The user wants me to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each event, it seems like each line represents an event with three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file-related data. The process name is always \"git.exe,\" which makes sense because Git is a version control system widely used for code management. \n\nThe task in the Windows log is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate),\" indicating that each event is about a new file being created. That's pretty standard when dealing with Git operations, like cloning repositories or installing packages.\n\nNow, looking at the files being created, their paths are all under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" followed by different package names and various file types. This looks like a node_modules directory, which is typical in JavaScript projects to store third-party libraries and modules.\n\nEach event creates files such as .js, .d.ts (TypeScript declaration files), package.json, license, readme.md, etc. These are all standard files you'd expect when installing or updating Node.js packages using npm. For example, \"set-function-length\" and \"shebang-command\" are common npm packages that handle specific functionalities.\n\nI'm noticing a pattern where multiple files from the same package are being created in quick succession. This is normal during an npm install operation because it's downloading and extracting many files for different packages. The fact that all these events come from git.exe might seem odd at first, but Git can be used with Node.js scripts or tools, so it's plausible.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency of these events. If this happened over a short period, say within a few seconds, it could indicate a bulk operation like installing dependencies for a project. However, if these events are spread out, it might raise more questions. But given that each event is just a file creation from Git, and they're all related to node_modules, there's no immediate sign of malicious activity.\n\nI should also check if any of the files created are known to be suspicious or part of malware. The package names like \"set-function-length\" and \"shebang-command\" don't ring any bells as malicious. They seem to be legitimate npm packages used in software development.\n\nMoreover, since all events are from the same user (fiddelis) and targeting a specific directory structure related to their coursework (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"), it's likely they're working on a project that requires these Node.js modules. This would explain why Git is involved—perhaps they're managing dependencies using npm scripts within their repository.\n\nI don't see any unusual process names or file paths that could indicate unauthorized access or malicious behavior. Everything points towards normal software development activities, specifically setting up and managing project dependencies with Node.js and npm through Git.\n\nIn conclusion, these events seem to be part of standard operations for a developer using Git and Node.js. There's no evidence of anything out of the ordinary or potentially harmful here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"isInteresting\": false,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The logs indicate normal file creation activities associated with Node.js package installations under a user's development directory, which is expected during software development using Git and npm.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst off, all the events are coming from \"git.exe\". That makes sense because Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. Each event is labeled as a file creation under Windows, which aligns with how Git operates—cloning repositories creates new files, so seeing a bunch of file creations isn't unusual.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to \"C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\". This looks like a directory where Node.js modules are stored. Each entry is creating files like .nycrc, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, README.md, and others that you'd expect in a typical npm package structure.\n\nI'm noticing multiple entries for different modules: side-channel, signal-exit, slice-ansi, etc. These are all legitimate Node.js packages. For example, \"side-channel\" is a known module used for communication between processes, and \"slice-ansi\" deals with ANSI string manipulation. Their presence here doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThe event data also includes standard files for each module—licenses, READMEs, package.json files—which are all normal parts of the npm ecosystem. There's no indication of anything malicious like unusual file names, executable files outside scripts, or hidden files that shouldn't be there.\n\nSince all these events are about creating files during a Git operation, and they're standard for setting up a project with Node.js dependencies, I don't see any signs of suspicious activity. It doesn't look like an attack or unauthorized access because the actions fit typical user behavior in a development context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch seems to be part of normal software development activities.

The paths all lead to different files within the \"sshpk\" directory located in a node_modules folder. Node_modules suggests this is part of a JavaScript project, which makes sense since Git could be cloning or pulling a repository that includes such modules.\n\nLooking at the files being created, I see everything from .travis.yml and Jenkinsfile (which are build scripts) to LICENSE and README.md (standard documentation files). There are also binary executables like sshpk-conv, sshpk-sign, and sshpk-verify in the bin folder. Under lib, there are various JavaScript files related to algorithms and cryptographic functions, which is typical for an SSH key management tool.\n\nSince all these files are part of a standard package structure, it doesn't raise any immediate red flags.

All events have similar structures: they mention a process named \"git.exe\", a task related to file creation under the Windows log (winlog), and specific file paths.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n{\n  \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\n  \"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\n  \"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\sshpk\\\\lib\\\\formats\\\\pkcs1.js\"}\n}\n\nThis event indicates that git.exe is creating a file in the path specified. The same pattern repeats across all events, with different files being created under the \"node_modules\\sshpk\\\" directory.\n\nI notice that this is happening within a directory structure related to a course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\") and inside \"node_modules\", which suggests it's part of a Node.js project. The files being created are JavaScript libraries, such as pkcs1.js, pkcs8.js, etc., and documentation in the 'man' directory.\n\nGiven that git.exe is typically used for version control, specifically cloning repositories or managing files, it makes sense that during these operations, new files are being created. Node modules are standard components used in Node.js applications, so their creation is a normal part of development.\n\nAll events are file creation tasks performed by the same process (git.exe) and within expected locations for a software project setup. There's no indication of any unusual behavior such as access to restricted areas, failed attempts, or inconsistencies that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nI also consider if there are any red flags. Since all actions are related to setting up a development environment, it doesn't appear suspicious. The files created don't seem to be associated with known malicious activities. Furthermore, the frequency and number of events here (18 in total) could be typical when initializing or updating a Node.js project.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing each event and considering the context of software development, I conclude that this batch doesn't indicate any malicious behavior.

That suggests that these are all related to Git operations, probably during development or version control activities. The repeated occurrence of the same process indicates a single application's activity, which in this case is normal for someone using Git.\n\nNext, each event is about a file being created. Specifically, the files are located under \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\tcomb\". I recognize that node_modules is a directory typically used by Node.js applications to store third-party libraries and modules. The path structure looks standard for a project setup with Node.js.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they include various JavaScript files like Any.js, Array.js, Boolean.js, etc., which are common in library structures. These seem to be part of the 'tcomb' module, which I recall is a type-checking library used in Node.js projects. The presence of multiple files being created in this pattern aligns with the process of installing or updating dependencies via npm (Node Package Manager), where Git might be involved during setup or script execution.\n\nSince all events are tied to the same user and the same directory, there's no indication of unusual access patterns or permissions issues. There’s nothing here that suggests malicious activity like multiple failed login attempts, unexpected file deletions, or access to sensitive files outside a project scope.\n\nThe repetition of similar events is actually normal when dependencies are being installed.

The node_modules directory being created by Git could indicate that someone is setting up a project, initializing npm packages, or perhaps using Git hooks that involve Node.js scripts.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be malicious? Sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like Git for lateral movement or to execute commands.

Sometimes CI\/CD pipelines or automated tools run Git commands and create files as part of deployment. However, without additional context like timestamps or other log entries, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to monitor for unusual activity, this batch doesn't show red flags.
