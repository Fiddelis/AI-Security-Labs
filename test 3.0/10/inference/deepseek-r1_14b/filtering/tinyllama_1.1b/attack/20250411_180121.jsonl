Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first few entries are all from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. These seem normal for a browser process, so probably not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen I notice powershell.exe appearing multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The events show file operations: creating temporary files in the user's AppData folder, which might be part of script execution. There are file creation and deletion events, which could indicate a script trying to drop or delete files as part of its process.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple DownloadFile calls from different GitHub repositories. Each one is downloading a LICENSE.txt file into temporary locations. This is concerning because it suggests that PowerShell is fetching code from external sources without clear justification. In legitimate use cases, scripts often reference known and static paths, but these URLs look varied and might be attempting to retrieve malicious payloads.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of DownloadFile with different repository names (unidade_base, entrada_temporario, etc.), which could indicate an attempt to avoid detection or to download multiple components. The fact that they're saving files with names like 'unidade_ativo.txt' and others doesn't provide any clear purpose, making it suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell loads various .NET framework DLLs, which is normal for its operation, but combined with the file downloads, it raises questions about what those files are being used for. The fact that some of these operations are happening in the TEMP directory and then possibly deleted adds to the suspicion, as attackers often clean up traces.\n\nOther events include pipe creation and registry modifications by PowerShell, which could be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement within a network. Registry changes can indicate attempts to maintain long-term access or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nOverall, while some activities might not individually look bad, the combination of multiple file downloads from varying external sources, temporary file operations, and use of PowerShell scripting points towards potentially malicious behavior. The confidence is high because such patterns are commonly associated with attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from various GitHub repositories to temporary locations, combined with file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a file creation event from winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That seems normal because it's part of the logging setup.\n\nNext, notepad.exe setting a registry value. Notpad is common and often used innocuously, so no red flags here.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious. However, on its own, process access isn't suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nThere are multiple instances of svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common Windows process, often part of services, so this doesn't raise alarms unless the registry changes are unusual.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is standard since it's a legitimate system file.\n\nWhoami.exe being run from the command line is normal for checking user information. No issues here.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe command deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\". This could be suspicious if \"spawn\" is unknown, but without context, it's hard to say. However, in this case, it's followed by other events that might provide more insight.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing processes again and then running a schtasks.exe command to delete the same task. The use of SCHTASKS to delete tasks can be part of legitimate cleanup or could indicate malicious activity like removing evidence.\n\nRunning reg.exe to delete a registry entry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the value \"pacote_auxiliar\". This is another attempt to remove something from the system, which might be trying to clean up traces of previous activities. Deleting entries in the Run key can prevent programs from launching on startup, which could be malicious behavior.\n\nConhost.exe modifying registry values—conhost is usually related to console windows, so this seems out of place unless it's part of a legitimate process, but it's worth noting.\n\nMultiple events with command lines invoking powershell.exe with \"& {}\" which doesn't execute any code. This might be a failed attempt or a test run, possibly indicating a script testing the environment without executing harmful commands yet.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe creating and then deleting a temporary PowerShell script file. This could be part of testing script execution policies or actual malicious script execution. The creation and deletion within a short time frame raises suspicion as it might be an attempt to execute code without leaving a persistent trace.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of process creations, registry modifications, deletions of scheduled tasks and registry entries, and PowerShell activities suggest potential malicious behavior. These actions could indicate someone attempting to clean up traces of previous activities or deploying malware that uses these methods to maintain persistence or erase evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially suspicious activities including registry modifications, process deletions, and PowerShell events indicative of possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is involved. PowerShell can be both legitimate for admin tasks and malicious for executing scripts. The first few events mention 'Pipe Created' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might indicate communication between processes or the execution of commands. Then there's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe, which I think is related to log management—probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, several events show powershell.exe accessing files like MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal because PowerShell might interact with system components. There are also multiple 'Image loaded' tasks, which could be standard DLL loading, but I should check if the paths look unusual. The mention of mscoree.dll and clr.dll suggests .NET framework usage, which again is common.\n\nThere's an event where a file called __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1 is created in the Temp directory. Temporary PowerShell scripts can be part of legitimate operations, but they're also often used by malware to test execution without persisting. This might be a red flag because it's a script that could potentially have malicious code.\n\nLooking at other processes, conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are involved in some registry activity. Conhost is typically for console windows, and the registry changes could be part of normal operations or an attempt to hide traces. Chrome.exe also appears multiple times with registry events, which might just be updates or tracking but could indicate something else if the context was different.\n\nI notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell and involve process creation, file operations, and registry modifications. While some of these could be normal user activities, the combination—especially the script creation in Temp—is concerning because it's a common tactic for attackers to use such files temporarily before deletion or further actions.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several indicators that could point towards malicious activity, especially the script file and repeated PowerShell operations which often are part of attack chains. However, without more context on timestamps or user behavior, it's hard to be certain. But considering the nature of these events, I would lean towards classifying this as interesting due to potential signs of scripting abuse.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell-related activities, including script creation and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events, and they're all related to PowerShell activities on a system. Let me break down what's happening here.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe. That's a common script execution tool, which can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines show that it's trying to remove items from the TEMP directory, like .zip files and text files. For example, commands like Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore. This could mean someone is cleaning up after themselves, but in the context of cybersecurity, it might be an attempt to delete logs or evidence of previous actions.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are several types: Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, and others. The fact that multiple registry values are being set is a bit concerning because attackers often need to modify system configurations. The image loading events point to various DLLs, which might be part of legitimate operations, but sometimes can indicate malicious libraries being loaded.\n\nThere's also a file creation and then deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 in the TEMP directory. Creating and immediately deleting a script file could be a tactic to avoid detection or to test if certain policies are enforced. Additionally, there are several attempts to delete files with names like tarefa_base.zip, estrutura_comum.zip, etc., all in the TEMP folder. This pattern suggests that something is systematically removing multiple files, possibly to erase traces.\n\nThe presence of events where processes access other processes (ProcessAccess) might indicate some form of lateral movement or privilege escalation. The use of pipes (Pipe Created) could be a way for different processes to communicate, which can sometimes be used maliciously to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell instances are being spawned, files are being created and deleted quickly, registry modifications are happening, and there's activity related to system DLLs. These behaviors don't necessarily indicate an active attack but could be signs of suspicious activity that merits further investigation. The consistent use of powershell.exe for deletion commands without clear legitimate context raises the alarm.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events have command lines with encoded or varied file paths being deleted. This variability might be an attempt to avoid detection by using different filenames each time. Additionally, the involvement of components like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender could indicate attempts to interfere with antivirus operations, though I'm not certain about that without more context.\n\nIn summary, while some activities might be benign, the combination of PowerShell usage, file deletions in TEMP, registry changes, and multiple process creations points towards potential malicious behavior. It's important to dig deeper into these events to determine if they're part of an attack or just unusual legitimate activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"observed-threat-activity\": {\n    \"description\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including file deletions, registry modifications, and process creations were observed.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nStarting with the first few lines, it seems like powershell.exe is involved in several activities. There's a process access task, registry value set, and image loading from various .NET framework paths. That's normal because PowerShell often loads these components when running scripts. But then I notice that there are multiple FileCreate events related to temporary files being created under the user's AppData directory. For example, C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 and others. These might be test files or remnants of script execution.\n\nLooking further, there are several Remove-Item commands in the command line arguments for powershell.exe, targeting specific .txt files in the TEMP directory. This could indicate that someone is trying to delete files they shouldn't have access to, or maybe cleaning up evidence after some activity. The fact that multiple files are being removed might raise a flag because it's unusual unless it's part of a legitimate script.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution, which is often used to check user privileges or system information. That's common for scripts to gather info, but when combined with the other activities, it might be more concerning.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome might update its settings, seeing multiple registry changes could indicate something malicious, especially if they're happening in quick succession.\n\nPutting this all together: a lot of activity from PowerShell, including script execution, file creation\/deletion, and process access. The repeated attempts to remove files in the TEMP directory and the use of whoami.exe might suggest someone is trying to cover their tracks or elevate privileges. Also, the combination of these actions happening in a short time frame could be indicative of malicious behavior.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all this is suspicious because sometimes scripts do perform multiple operations. However, the specific commands and file deletions are enough for me to classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion and whoami.exe execution suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given two JSONL entries. Each line represents a log event. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event has the process name as 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for system administration, but it can also be abused by attackers for malicious purposes like executing commands, accessing files, or even downloading malware. So, seeing PowerShell in logs could be a red flag if not explained properly.\n\nLooking at the second event, it's 'whoami.exe' being executed with the command line pointing to \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". Whoami is typically used to display user information on the system. It's usually innocent since it doesn't do much beyond showing details like username or group memberships.\n\nNow, considering these two events together: one involves PowerShell and the other a simple whoami command. If I were analyzing this in isolation, the PowerShell event might raise an eyebrow because of its versatility in both legitimate and malicious activities. However, when combined with the whoami.exe, which is generally benign, it's possible that someone was using PowerShell to run additional commands or scripts.\n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators here? The events don't show any unusual file accesses, network connections, or other suspicious activities. Both events are pretty straightforward—PowerShell being executed (maybe just starting up) and whoami running as usual. There's no evidence of malicious files being accessed, no registry modifications, or any other signs that might indicate foul play.\n\nI also need to think about the context. Are these logs from a user session where someone is performing routine tasks? If so, then it's possible that a legitimate admin was using PowerShell for scripting and then ran whoami to check their permissions. Alternatively, maybe an automated script or scheduled task triggered both processes as part of normal operations.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes attackers use multiple tools in sequence. For example, they might execute a command with whoami to gather information and then use PowerShell for more complex tasks. But without additional events showing other malicious activities, it's hard to confirm that. The logs provided don't show any subsequent actions after these two events, so I can't link them to a larger attack chain.\n\nI should also consider the source of the logs. If this is from an environment where such tools are commonly used (like in a DevOps setting), then seeing PowerShell and whoami together might not be unusual at all. However, if this environment doesn't typically use these tools, it could be more suspicious.\n\nLooking at the structure of the events: both have process names and command lines, but no file accesses or other events. The first event mentions 'powershell.exe' without a specific command line argument, which is a bit odd because PowerShell usually runs with some parameters unless it's just starting up. The second event has a clear path for whoami.exe.\n\nIn summary, while seeing PowerShell could be concerning, the lack of additional indicators and the presence of a benign tool like whoami don't strongly suggest malicious activity. Without more context or events showing suspicious behavior, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as not interesting because there's no concrete evidence of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the execution of 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe', which could be part of normal user activity or system administration tasks. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as file access, network connections, or other suspicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
