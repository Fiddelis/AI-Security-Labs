I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows cmd.exe being executed with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The command creates a task named win32times that runs daily. It uses powershell.exe with the -ep bypass argument, which I know can be used to avoid certain security restrictions. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, but wait, that's an interesting name and it ends with .ps1. Also, since the file doesn't exist (NonExistingScript), this might be a sign of something malicious trying to execute code without existing files.\n\n2. The second event is powershell.exe being accessed. Since the first event executed powershell, this could be part of that script's execution.\n\n3. Third event again is cmd.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\n4. Schtasks.exe is used here with an image load from taskschd.dll, which is legitimate since schtasks relies on that DLL. So this might not be suspicious by itself.\n\n5. Another schtasks.exe process creates the same task win32times again. This repetition makes me wonder if it's trying to ensure the task exists or perhaps creating multiple instances for some reason.\n\n6. The sixth event again shows schtasks loading taskschd.dll, which seems normal but occurs twice now.\n\n7. Conhost.exe is involved in setting a registry value. Conhost is often used by PowerShell as a host process, so this might be related to the earlier powershell.exe activity.\n\n8-11. Chrome.exe is accessing registry values multiple times. This could be part of its normal operation since some apps do access the registry for settings or extensions, but I'm not sure if it's unusual in this context.\n\n12. Winlogbeat.exe created a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. It seems related to log shipping or data collection tools, which is probably benign unless there's something else indicating misuse.\n\n13. Finally, whoami.exe was executed without any command line arguments beyond its path. Whoami usually just reports user information and isn't typically malicious on its own.\n\nPutting this together: The batch has several cmd and powershell executions with suspicious command lines. Schtasks is used to create a scheduled task that runs a non-existent script. Repetition of creating the same task might indicate persistence attempts or failed execution retries. The use of -ep bypass in powershell suggests an attempt to bypass restrictions, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nHowever, some events are normal system processes like chrome accessing the registry and schtasks loading DLLs. But considering the overall pattern, especially the repeated task creation with a non-existent script and the powershell execution with bypass, it's likely indicative of an attack attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple cmd.exe and schtasks.exe events creating a scheduled task that runs a non-existent PowerShell script. The use of -ep bypass suggests potential malicious activity aiming to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
