However, the frequent use of chrome.exe for setting registry values, combined with suspicious powershell.exe behavior such as accessing processes and file creation events in sensitive locations (e.g., Downloads directory), raises concerns about potential unauthorized or malicious activity. The involvement of winlogbeat.exe also suggests a possible log tampering effort, making this batch worth investigating.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
