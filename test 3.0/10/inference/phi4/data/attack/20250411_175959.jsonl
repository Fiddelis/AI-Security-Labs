Additionally, there are process creations like 'net1.exe' which could be a renamed or malicious variant of the legitimate 'net.exe'. Frequent registry value changes by Chrome.exe may suggest persistence mechanisms being set up, while multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe and updater.exe loading critical DLLs like 'combase.dll' and creating pipes can imply command-and-control activity.
