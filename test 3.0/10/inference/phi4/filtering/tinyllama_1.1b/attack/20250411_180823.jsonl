Additionally, 'powershell.exe' is involved in process access and file creation, suggesting potential script-based manipulation. The use of common system executables like 'svchost.exe', 'cmd.exe', and 'schtasks.exe' for registry modifications also raises suspicion, as these actions can be indicative of unauthorized configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
