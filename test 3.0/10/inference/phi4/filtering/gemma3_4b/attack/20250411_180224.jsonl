The use of `powershell.exe` with `-ep bypass -file <path>` suggests attempts to execute scripts with elevated privileges, bypassing execution policies. Additionally, the creation and querying of scheduled tasks (`schtasks`) point towards persistent scheduling of these malicious scripts. Other processes like `svchost.exe` are also setting registry values, which could be an attempt at persistence or altering system configurations. The repeated attempts to create files and modify registry entries further support this hypothesis.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
