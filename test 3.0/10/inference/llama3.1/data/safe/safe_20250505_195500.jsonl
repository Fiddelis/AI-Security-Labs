     }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nBased on the data, it appears that there are multiple instances of a file named `officeaicopilot-strings.min` being created in different directories under `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles`.\n\nThe `file_path` field indicates that the file is being created in a subdirectory with a unique identifier (in this case, `6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05`, but there are many other values as well).\n\nIt's worth noting that the event type is `file_creation`, which means that these events represent new files being created on the system. The frequency of these events suggests that the file creation activity is happening repeatedly and consistently.\n\nTo further analyze this data, you could consider using visualization tools to display the distribution of file creations across different directories or timespans."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"**Analysis**\n\nThe input data consists of a large number of JSON objects, each representing an event. The events are all related to file creation by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\".
