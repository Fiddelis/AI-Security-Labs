{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"**Anomaly Detection**\n\nUpon analyzing the provided data, it appears to be a series of log entries indicating file creation events. The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\", and the events are all related to creating files with specific names (e.g., \"en-us-ui-strings-json_328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10.js\").\n\n**Anomaly Detection Logic**\n\nTo determine if this pattern indicates an anomaly, we can apply a set of logical rules:\n\n1.  **Unique Process Name**: The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\", which may indicate a legitimate process.\n2.  **File Creation Pattern**: The file creation events follow a specific pattern:\n    *   They all have the same structure: \"language-code-ui-strings-json\\_hash.js\".\n    *   There are multiple files with different hash values, but they all belong to a single language code (e.g., \"en-us\", \"es-es\").\n3.  **High Frequency**: The frequency of these events is extremely high, indicating that the process may be creating numerous files within a short period.\n\n**Anomaly Detection Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above analysis, this pattern can be considered an anomaly due to:\n\n*   Its unusual structure and repetition.\n*   High frequency, which might indicate an issue with the system or a malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo further investigate this anomaly:\n\n1.  **Verify Legitimacy**: Check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate process on the system. If it's not recognized, it may be a malware or a misconfigured application.\n2.  **Analyze System Resources**: Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage) to see if the high frequency of file creation events affects performance.\n3.  **Review File Content**: Inspect the created files to determine their purpose and potential impact on the system.\n\n**Code for Anomaly Detection**\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that can help detect anomalies in this pattern:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_anomaly(log_entries):\n    # Define regular expression pattern for file creation events\n    pattern = r\"process='SDXHelper\\.exe', event='File created', path='\/.*'\"\n\n    # Count unique process names and file types (language codes)\n    unique_process_names = set([re.search(r\"process='(.*?)'\", entry).group(1) for entry in log_entries])\n    unique_language_codes = set(re.findall(r\"\\b\\w{2}\\-\\w{2}\\b\", [entry.split(', ')[-1] for entry in log_entries]))\n\n    # Check if the process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\"\n    consistent_process_name = len(unique_process_names) == 1 and unique_process_names.pop() == 'SDXHelper.exe'\n\n    # Count frequency of file creation events\n    freq_count = sum(1 for entry in log_entries if re.search(pattern, entry))\n\n    # Determine if the anomaly is likely a malicious activity\n    is_malicious = len(unique_language_codes) > 5 and freq_count > 100\n\n    return (consistent_process_name, len(unique_language_codes), freq_count) or is_malicious\n\nlog_entries = [...]  # provide your log entries here\n\nanomaly_result = is_anomaly(log_entries)\nprint(anomaly_result)\n```\n\nThis code uses regular expressions to extract relevant information from the log entries and apply the anomaly detection rules."}
