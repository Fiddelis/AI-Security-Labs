{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the processes mentioned. There's a lot of Registry value set events, which are common, but maybe not always benign. Then there's Image loaded events pointing to urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded from unexpected places or in unusual contexts, that could be a red flag. However, in the logs here, the paths are standard System32 locations, so maybe that's normal.\n\nLooking at the command lines. There's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems odd. Why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe trying to remove a process that's being used for something else. Also, the WMIC.exe entries have command lines that delete notepad.exe processes. That's a bit suspicious. WMIC is a legitimate tool, but using it to delete processes might be part of a malicious activity, like trying to clean up after themselves.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of powershell.exe with Process accessed events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for various malicious tasks. But just having ProcessAccess events isn't necessarily bad. However, combined with other activities, it might indicate something.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event shows a file created in the Downloads directory. That's normal for software installation, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe not. However, on its own, not too suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is a standard command to check user context. Not suspicious by itself.\n\nNow, looking for any patterns. The deletion of notepad.exe processes via WMIC and cmd.exe could be an attempt to terminate a process that's being used for malicious purposes. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide their activities. Also, multiple ImageLoad events for DLLs that are part of Windows Defender (like MpOAV.dll) might be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual way, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are legitimate.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe'. Calculator.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that might be a red flag. However, in this case, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity tied to it.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the deletion of notepad.exe processes via WMIC and cmd.exe. That seems out of the ordinary and could be an indicator of an attempt to remove evidence or prevent monitoring. However, without more context or additional suspicious events (like network activity, unusual file modifications, or privilege escalation), it's a bit hard to be certain.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's a lot of chrome.exe and powershell.exe activity, which is common but sometimes used in attacks. But let's check the specific events. The winlog tasks include Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's the well-known attack where the attacker replaces the Sticky Keys executable with a malicious one. That's a red flag right there. Also, another cmd.exe command uses schtasks to delete a task named win32times. Deleting a task might be part of cleaning up after an attack. \n\nThen there's the schtasks.exe process with the same delete command. That's consistent with the previous cmd.exe event. Also, the whoami.exe executions might be checking user privileges, which is common in privilege escalation attempts. \n\nLooking at the file paths, one entry has taskschd.dll loaded, which is a legitimate Windows file, so that might not be an issue. However, the combination of these processes and commands suggests someone is trying to modify system files and remove traces of their activities. \n\nEven though there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and powershell.exe, which can be normal, the specific commands related to replacing system files and deleting tasks are highly suspicious. The presence of multiple Process Create and Process Access events could indicate an attacker running multiple commands to achieve their goal. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the key events are the sethc.exe replacement and the schtasks deletion.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, so there are a bunch of events here. Let's start by breaking them down.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple instances of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a common indicator of potential malicious activity because changing registry values can be used to persist or modify system behavior. But I need to check if there's anything more suspicious here.\n\nThen, looking at the 'chrome.exe' entries. There are events where it loads 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. But if it's being loaded by something unexpected, that could be a problem. However, chrome.exe loading these files might be part of normal operations, but I should note that.\n\nNext, there's 'powershell.exe' with a command line that's just '& {}', which seems like a no-op. That might be a sign of obfuscation or testing. Also, there's a file created in the Temp directory named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1'. The name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which could be related to testing script execution policies. But creating a script in Temp might be part of normal PowerShell usage, though sometimes malicious scripts are placed there.\n\nLooking at the 'whoami.exe' executions. That's a standard tool for checking user context, so unless it's being used in a suspicious way, it's probably benign.\n\nNow, the 'Image loaded' events for 'mscoree.dll', 'mscoreei.dll', 'clr.dll', etc., are related to the .NET runtime. PowerShell using these is normal because it's built on .NET. However, if these are being loaded from unexpected paths or in unusual contexts, that could be a red flag. But the paths here seem legitimate.\n\nThe repeated 'Registry value set' events by 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' might indicate attempts to modify system settings. However, without knowing the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to say. But the frequency might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the 'Process accessed' events for 'powershell.exe' could indicate that another process is interacting with it, which might be part of a larger attack chain. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several suspicious activities like multiple registry modifications, loading of security-related DLLs, and creation of temporary files. However, some of these could be part of normal operations, especially with PowerShell and Chrome. The presence of 'MpOAV.dll' being loaded by chrome.exe might be a red flag since that's part of Windows Defender. But if Chrome is doing that, maybe it's a false positive or part of a legitimate security check.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern. The creation of the Temp file with a script policy test name might be part of a script that's being tested. But combined with the registry changes and multiple process interactions, it could be an indicator of compromise. However, without more context or known bad indicators, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nOverall, while there are several suspicious events, they could be part of normal system behavior or testing. But the combination of registry changes, process interactions, and temporary file creation might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of legitimate system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlights**\n1. **Frequent Registry Modifications**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`** repeatedly perform **`Registry value set`** operations. While registry edits are common in system administration, **frequent or unexplained changes** (especially by scripts or non-admin tools) could indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **malicious configuration changes**.\n\n2. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - **`chrome.exe`** loads **`amsi.dll`** (Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface) and **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender's real-time protection component). While these are legitimate, **non-security processes loading security-related DLLs** may indicate **tampering** or **bypassing protections** (e.g., disabling Defender via injection).\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created in the **`Temp` directory**. The filename suggests **script policy testing**, which could be **legitimate** (e.g., testing execution policies) but is also a **common tactic** for malware to execute payloads in memory or persist.\n\n4. **.NET Runtime Loading**:\n   - **`powershell.exe`** loads **`.NET`** components like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscorlib.ni.dll`. While normal for PowerShell, **unusual combinations** or **loading from non-standard paths** could hint at **malicious code execution** (e.g., using .NET for obfuscation).\n\n5. **Process Access Events**:\n   - **`Process accessed`** events for `powershell.exe` may indicate **inter-process communication** or **external tooling** interacting with PowerShell, which could be part of **attack chains** (e.g., downloading payloads or executing commands).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **`whoami.exe`** executions are standard for checking user context.\n- **`chrome.exe`** loading `amsi.dll` or `MpOAV.dll` might be part of **legitimate security checks** or **extension behaviors**.\n- **.NET DLLs** are core to PowerShell's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Low-Moderate Risk**: The logs do not confirm malicious activity but include **potential red flags** (e.g., registry edits, temp file creation). \n- **Context-Dependent**: Without additional indicators (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized user accounts, or anomalous process behavior), the activity could be **benign** (e.g., script testing, system maintenance).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate Registry Changes**:\n   - Audit the **specific registry keys** modified by `cmd.exe`\/`powershell.exe` to determine legitimacy.\n\n2. **Analyze the Temp Script**:\n   - Check the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` for **obfuscated code** or **malicious payloads**.\n\n3. **Monitor Defender Components**:\n   - Verify if `amsi.dll`\/`MpOAV.dll` are being **tampered with** or **bypassed** (e.g., via `AmsiInitialize` hooks).\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Cross-reference with **network logs**, **user activity**, and **process tree data** to identify **unusual patterns** (e.g., PowerShell downloading files, lateral movement).\n\n5. **Enable Advanced Threat Detection**:\n   - Use tools like **Microsoft Defender ATP**, **SIEM**, or **EDR** to detect **behavioral anomalies** (e.g., PowerShell executing suspicious commands, registry edits during off-hours).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not definitively indicate a compromise, the combination of **registry modifications**, **unusual DLL loading**, and **temporary script creation** warrants **further investigation**. These could be signs of **testing**, **malware**, or **legitimate administrative tasks**—context is critical."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a file deletion event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory.

These usually relate to the PowerShell engine's internal processes. However, the repetition of these events might be normal, but I should check if there's any pattern.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple PowerShell processes executing commands that check for the existence of various batch files across different paths. The paths mentioned are a mix of system directories and some custom names like \"modulo_geral\" or \"estrutura_geral\". These paths don't seem standard, which could be a sign of obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That's probably legitimate, but it's just one event among many.\n\nThe presence of \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with the system in ways that could be part of an attack, like modifying registry settings or accessing other processes.\n\nHowever, most of the events are related to normal PowerShell operations, and without more context like unusual network activity or unexpected command-line arguments, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The key points here are the file deletion in Temp, the repeated checks for specific batch files, and the non-standard paths. These could be part of a script that's probing the system or trying to execute payloads, but I need to see if there's a clear pattern of malicious behavior. Since the events don't show direct malicious actions like downloading files or connecting to suspicious IPs, but the combination of events does raise some flags, I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show file deletion in Temp directory, repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks, and suspicious path checks in non-standard directories.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several Process Create and Process Access events. Then there are Image Load events pointing to various DLLs, some of which are part of .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but then there's a File Created and then immediately a File Delete event for a temporary script file. That might be suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of PowerShell checking if certain paths exist, like \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\" etc. These paths seem to be checking for the existence of batch files in directories that might be temporary or related to some components. The use of \"..\\\" suggests navigating up directories, which could be part of a script trying to access files in parent directories, maybe to avoid detection.\n\nThe Chrome.exe events are all about registry value sets, but they're repeated multiple times. However, since they're all from Chrome and not PowerShell, maybe they're just normal operations unless there's something specific about the registry keys being modified. But without more info, it's hard to say. However, the majority of the events are PowerShell-related, so that's the main focus.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, which is expected, but when combined with the file creation and deletion, it might indicate that a script is being executed, temporary files are created, and then deleted. This is a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe command lines in the PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of certain batch files. If they exist, it exits 0, else 1. This could be part of a larger script that's conditional, maybe checking if certain prerequisites are met before proceeding with more malicious activities. However, without seeing the actual content of those batch files, it's hard to tell if they're benign or malicious.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple such checks in different directories might suggest that the attacker is trying to execute scripts in various locations, possibly to bypass security measures or to check for the presence of certain files that indicate the environment is suitable for further attacks.\n\nThe File Created event for the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive could be related to PowerShell profiles, which are scripts that run automatically when PowerShell starts. If an attacker is modifying these profiles, that could be a way to maintain persistence. However, the file is in the AppData directory, which is common for user-specific settings, so maybe it's legitimate. But again, without more context, it's a bit hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of files, creating and deleting temporary files, and loading various DLLs could be indicative of suspicious behavior. While some of these actions are normal for PowerShell, the pattern here might be more indicative of an attempt to execute scripts in a stealthy manner. Therefore, this batch of events might warrant further investigation to determine if there's any malicious activity occurring.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation due to potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Behavior:**\n   - **Path Checks:** Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `Test-Path` to check for the existence of batch files in directories such as `C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..` and `C:\\modulo_logico\\componente_padrao\\..`. The use of `..` suggests directory traversal, which could be an attempt to access files in parent directories or bypass path restrictions.\n   - **Conditional Execution:** The scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on whether the target batch files exist. This could indicate conditional logic to determine next steps (e.g., payload execution, persistence setup, or environment checks).\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary script file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in malware to avoid leaving traces on the system.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - PowerShell loads DLLs from **Windows Defender** (`MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and **.NET Framework** components. While these are legitimate, the repetition and combination with file operations raise concerns about potential tampering or evasion techniques.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications (Chrome.exe):**\n   - Chrome.exe modifies registry values repeatedly. While this could be benign (e.g., extension updates), the lack of context (e.g., specific keys\/paths) makes it unclear. However, the focus on PowerShell events suggests this may be a secondary distraction.\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Stealthy File Operations:** Creation and deletion of temporary files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) may indicate an attempt to execute scripts without leaving evidence.\n- **Path Traversal:** The use of `..` in path checks could be an attempt to access files in unexpected locations or bypass security controls.\n- **Conditional Logic:** The presence of conditional checks (`if (Test-Path ...)`) suggests the scripts may be probing the environment before proceeding with further actions.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the Batch Files:** Check the contents of the batch files referenced in the `Test-Path` commands (e.g., `objeto_temporario_script.bat`) to determine if they contain malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Profiles:** The creation of `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` may relate to PowerShell profile modifications. Verify if this file is part of legitimate user configurations or if it contains malicious code.\n- **Analyze DLL Loads:** Confirm that the loaded DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`) are legitimate and not tampered with. Unusual behavior from these modules could indicate evasion or exploitation.\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference these events with system logs, network traffic, and process tree analysis to identify potential lateral movement, command-and-control (C2) communication, or persistence mechanisms.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities (e.g., PowerShell scripting, DLL loading) are normal, the combination of **file creation\/deletion**, **path traversal**, and **conditional logic** raises concerns about potential malicious intent. This batch of events should be flagged for further investigation to rule out threats such as **script-based malware**, **persistence mechanisms**, or **evasion techniques**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the entries, most of them involve PowerShell.exe with various Windows log tasks. There's a lot of 'Registry value set' events, which might be normal, but I should check for any suspicious patterns. \n\nThen, there's a process create event with a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content. The command line creates a batch file and writes \"dir\" into another. That seems odd because writing a simple \"dir\" command into a script might be part of a larger payload. Also, the paths mentioned are a bit convoluted with multiple ..\\, which could be trying to obfuscate the actual location.\n\nNext, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. Loading these is normal for .NET applications, but when combined with PowerShell, it might indicate something like a .NET assembly being used in a malicious way. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is also there, which is a legitimate file. So that might not be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. The command lines here are similar, creating batch files in various paths and setting their content to \"dir\". The repetition of this pattern across different paths might be an attempt to execute commands in multiple locations, possibly to evade detection or spread the payload.\n\nAlso, there's a 'File created' event in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script. While creating files in Temp is common, the filename has a PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be related to script execution policies. However, the content isn't shown, so it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to create and modify files, especially with obfuscated paths and the involvement of .NET components, raises some flags. However, without more context or seeing the actual content of the created files, it's a bit hard to confirm. But the pattern of creating multiple batch files with simple commands might be part of a larger attack, such as setting up backdoors or executing commands later. \n\nI should also consider that some of these events could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the high frequency and the use of obfuscation techniques (like the ..\\ in paths) lean towards suspicious activity. The presence of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events might indicate that the scripts are part of a module or a larger process that's being initialized multiple times, which could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nSo, based on the patterns observed, even though not all events are clearly malicious, the combination of repeated PowerShell activities, obfuscated file paths, and the creation of temporary files does warrant further investigation. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting and should be looked into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits patterns that warrant further investigation due to potential indicators of suspicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries involve `powershell.exe` executing commands to **create batch files** (`New-Item`) and **write content** (`Set-Content`) into them. For example:\n     ```powershell\n     New-Item \"C:\\path\\to\\file.bat\" -Force; Set-Content -Path \"C:\\another\\path\\script.bat\" -Value \"dir\"\n     ```\n     - The use of `dir` (a basic directory listing command) in scripts is unusual unless part of a larger payload. This could be **obfuscation** to mask malicious intent.\n\n2. **Obfuscated File Paths:**\n   - Paths like `C:\\componente_geral\\modulo_secundario..\\registro_geral\\pacote_auxiliar_script.bat` use `..\\` to traverse directories. This may be an attempt to **evade detection** or hide the true location of files.\n\n3. **.NET DLL Loading:**\n   - Events like `Image loaded` for `.NET` components (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are normal for .NET applications but, when combined with PowerShell, could indicate **exploitation of .NET assemblies** for malicious purposes (e.g., code injection).\n\n4. **Temporary File Creation:**\n   - A file is created in the **Temp directory**:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`.  \n     - The filename includes `PSScriptPolicyTest`, which may relate to **script execution policy bypasses**. While not inherently malicious, the lack of context raises questions about its purpose.\n\n5. **High Frequency of \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events:**\n   - Multiple entries with `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` tasks suggest **modular or automated scripting**. This could indicate a **coordinated attack** (e.g., deploying a multi-stage payload).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Suspicion**: While individual events (e.g., registry writes, .NET DLLs) are common in legitimate scenarios, the **repetition of PowerShell-based file creation**, **obfuscated paths**, and **unusual script content** (e.g., `dir` in scripts) could signal **malicious activity** such as:\n  - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., creating backdoors).\n  - **Command-and-control (C2) setup** via obfuscated scripts.\n  - **Exploitation of PowerShell for lateral movement**.\n\n- **Need for Context**: Without additional data (e.g., file content, user behavior, network traffic), it is **not definitive**, but the pattern is **suspicious enough to warrant investigation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Analyze the contents** of the created files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) for malicious code.\n- **Check for lateral movement** (e.g., network connections to external IPs).\n- **Review user activity logs** for `fiddelis` to determine if the user has elevated privileges or access to sensitive systems.\n- **Monitor for follow-on actions** (e.g., execution of the created batch files, unusual process behavior).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe batch of events is **interesting and potentially indicative of malicious activity**. While not conclusive, the repetitive PowerShell use, obfuscation, and creation of temporary files merit further analysis to rule out exploitation or persistence attempts."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event: PowerShell.exe is involved in a File Delete logged event. The file path is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. But deleting a script might be normal, but maybe not always. Let me check others.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but not necessarily malicious. Then, a File Created event with a .bat file in a directory named \"componente_geral\". Creating a batch file might be part of normal operations, but sometimes malicious scripts are created here.\n\nAnother File Created event in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's a bit suspicious because startup scripts can be used to run code automatically. But maybe it's part of a legitimate setup.\n\nThere are several Image Loaded events, which are normal as PowerShell uses various DLLs. However, there's a File Delete event for a script in the Temp folder. The command lines show PowerShell scripts that check if certain files exist and exit with 0 or 1. These might be part of checking for existence, but maybe they're trying to ensure that certain files are present before proceeding.\n\nWait, looking at the command lines, they all have similar structures: using Test-Path to check if a file exists and then exiting with 0 or 1. This could be part of a script that's verifying if certain files are in place. However, the paths mentioned are a bit generic and have a pattern with multiple directories and \"..\" which might be trying to navigate up directories. That could be a red flag, but maybe it's just part of the script's logic.\n\nAlso, there's a registry value set event, which is common but could be part of configuring something. However, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are creating files and checking for existence might indicate some automated process. But are these files part of a legitimate application or something else?\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines across different paths might suggest that the same script is being run multiple times with different file paths. This could be part of a setup or deployment process, but it's also possible that it's part of a malicious activity trying to establish presence across different directories.\n\nHowever, without more context, like the actual content of the files or the user's actions, it's hard to tell. But the presence of multiple file creations, deletions, and checks might be worth investigating further. The fact that some files are in the Temp directory and others in Startup folders could be suspicious. Also, the use of multiple Test-Path commands might be part of a larger script that's checking for dependencies or trying to ensure that certain files are in place for execution.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these activities are normal for PowerShell, the combination of multiple file operations, the use of Temp and Startup directories, and the repetitive nature of the commands might indicate a need for further investigation. It's not definitively malicious, but there are enough indicators to warrant looking into it more closely.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A PowerShell script deletes a `.ps1` file in the **Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`). While temporary files are common, deletion of scripts could indicate cleanup post-execution, which may be benign or part of a larger process.\n\n2. **File Creation in Startup Locations:**\n   - A `.bat` file is created in the **StartupProfileData-NonInteractive** folder. This directory is associated with **Windows PowerShell profiles**, which can execute scripts automatically. While legitimate, this could be exploited for persistence if the script is malicious.\n\n3. **Repetitive `Test-Path` Commands:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like:\n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\\...\\...\\..._script.bat\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n     These checks are repeated across different paths, suggesting a script verifying the existence of files in nested directories. The use of `..` (parent directory navigation) could be intentional or obfuscation.\n\n4. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Normal `.dll` loads (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are expected for PowerShell operations. No direct malicious indicators here.\n\n5. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Events like `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` are routine for PowerShell execution but may hint at complex scripting or automation.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Persistence Risk:** The `.bat` file in the **StartupProfileData** directory could be used to execute code at user login, which is a common persistence mechanism for malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** The use of nested paths and repetitive `Test-Path` checks might be an attempt to evade detection or mask the script's true purpose.\n- **Unusual Behavior:** While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the combination of file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repetitive checks could indicate **suspicious automation** or **malware probing the environment**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `.bat` File:**\n   - Analyze the content of the file created in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` to determine its purpose.\n   - Check if it references external resources or executes other scripts.\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Use tools like **Event Viewer**, **SIEM**, or **PowerShell logging** to track the origin of these commands (e.g., user, process, parent process).\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies:**\n   - Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network activity, registry changes) to identify if this is part of a larger attack chain.\n\n4. **Consider Endpoint Protection:**\n   - If this is on a production system, ensure **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)** tools are monitoring for suspicious PowerShell behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile not definitively malicious, the combination of **file creation in startup directories**, **repetitive script checks**, and **unusual path navigation** raises **low-to-moderate risk**. Further investigation is recommended to rule out benign automation or potential malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell processes. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. There are several instances where PowerShell is running scripts that check if a certain file exists, like Test-Path with various paths. The paths mentioned are all over the place, some in system directories, others in user-specific locations. But the scripts just exit 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. That seems odd. Why would someone check for these files? Maybe they're looking for the presence of certain executables, perhaps as part of a payload delivery or checking for a dropped file.\n\nWait, there's also a winlogbeat process creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if someone is setting up log collection. But that's not necessarily malicious. However, the rest of the events are all about PowerShell doing these Test-Path checks. The fact that there are so many of them, each with different paths, might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for specific files. Maybe they're looking for a place to drop a payload or checking if certain conditions are met before executing malicious code.\n\nAlso, the tasks logged in winlog include things like Provider Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, File Delete, Pipe Created, etc. Some of these are normal system events, but the repetition of PowerShell checking for files in different directories could be a red flag. The use of '..' in the paths might be an attempt to traverse directories, but in the command lines, it's part of the quoted path. Wait, looking at the first event: \"C:\\\\modulo_geral\\\\estrutura_geral\\\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat\". The '..' here would take it up one directory, so the actual path is modulo_geral\/estrutura_geral's parent, then into elemento_auxiliar. That might be a way to reference files in different directories, but not necessarily malicious. However, if the attacker is checking for the presence of these files, it might be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nAnother thing to note is that all these Test-Path commands are in the same format. They might be part of a script that's checking for the presence of various files, which could be part of a multi-stage attack. The fact that there are so many of them (17 entries) might be more than just normal system activity. Also, the exit codes (0 or 1) might be used to determine the next steps in the attack, like whether to proceed with execution or not.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any actual file modifications, execution of payloads, or network activity. They're just checking for the existence of files. But in the context of an investigation, such repetitive and numerous checks could be suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a reconnaissance phase, where the attacker is mapping the system to find where to deploy payloads or where to hide files.\n\nSo, considering all that, while there's no direct proof of malicious intent, the pattern of multiple PowerShell processes checking for the existence of various files across different directories might warrant further investigation. It's on the edge of normal and suspicious, but enough to flag for a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows a pattern of **PowerShell processes repeatedly checking for the existence of specific files** across various directories using `Test-Path`. While some activity is benign, the **repetition, volume, and structure** of these checks warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent `Test-Path` Checks**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the presence of files in paths like:\n     ```\n     C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral..\\elemento_auxiliar\\componente_secundario_script.bat\n     ```\n     ```\n     C:\\entrada_secundario\\entrada_comum\\registro_temporario\\bin\\tarefa_ativo.exe\n     ```\n   - The use of `..` (directory traversal) in some paths may indicate attempts to **probe system structure** or locate specific files.\n\n2. **No Direct Malicious Activity**:\n   - No evidence of file creation, execution of payloads, or network activity is present.\n   - The scripts only **exit with 0\/1** based on file existence, suggesting **conditional logic** (e.g., \"if file exists, proceed\").\n\n3. **High Volume of Similar Events**:\n   - **17+ PowerShell events** with similar patterns, which is unusual for normal system behavior.\n   - Could indicate **reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for dropped files, prerequisites for an attack, or system configuration).\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - A single event involves `winlogbeat` creating a file (`registro_temporario\\bin\\tarefa_ativo.exe`), which is normal for log shippers but could be **misused** if the tool is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Suspicious:**\n- **Repetition**: The sheer number of `Test-Path` commands is atypical for legitimate scripts.\n- **Conditional Logic**: The use of `Test-Path` with exit codes suggests **conditional execution** (e.g., \"if this file exists, run a payload\").\n- **Directory Traversal**: The inclusion of `..` in paths may hint at **system mapping** or attempts to bypass directory restrictions.\n- **Lack of Context**: No associated events (e.g., file creation, execution, or network traffic) provide clarity on the purpose of these checks.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **file creation\/deletion** events, process execution, or network activity around the same time.\n   - Look for **user account** or **source IP** associated with these PowerShell commands.\n\n2. **Analyze File Paths**:\n   - Determine if the files being checked (e.g., `tarefa_ativo.exe`, `registro_geral.exe`) are legitimate or known malicious binaries.\n\n3. **Check for PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Investigate if these commands are part of a larger script (e.g., via `Invoke-Expression`, `Start-Process`, or `IEX`).\n\n4. **Review Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - Confirm if `winlogbeat` is being used legitimately or if its configuration was tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **no direct malicious activity** is confirmed, the **pattern of repetitive `Test-Path` checks** across multiple directories raises **red flags**. This behavior is consistent with **reconnaissance** or **preparation for an attack**. Further investigation is **strongly recommended** to determine intent and mitigate potential risks. \n\n**Risk Level**: Moderate (requires deeper analysis)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if there's any malicious activity going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a bunch of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessed. The first event shows a PowerShell command checking if a certain file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script. But then there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading those DLLs might be normal, but sometimes attackers use legitimate DLLs for malicious purposes. However, just loading them isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's a File Created and then immediately File Delete event for a temporary script file. That could be part of a legitimate process, like running a script and cleaning up afterward. But sometimes malware does similar things to avoid leaving traces. However, the fact that it's deleted right after might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the PowerShell commands are checking for the existence of specific executable files. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\\\registro_ativo\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_comum.exe\", don't look like standard Windows paths. They have a lot of Portuguese words, which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is using obfuscation or trying to blend in with local naming conventions. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious or just a normal application.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. The 'cmd.exe' process is running a command to check if a temporary file exists. Again, this could be part of a normal script, but the combination with the PowerShell events might be worth looking into.\n\nThe repeated Process Access and Registry value set events might indicate that the process is interacting with the system in ways that could be part of a larger attack. However, without more information on what's being accessed or changed in the registry, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the events don't show clear signs of malware, like downloading files from the internet, connecting to suspicious IPs, or modifying critical system files. The activities seem to be checking for the presence of certain files and cleaning up temporary files. However, the non-standard paths and the use of PowerShell for these checks could be indicative of something more. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious intent, maybe it's just a benign script. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands checking for files in unusual directories might be enough to flag this as suspicious, warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows a mix of legitimate system activity and potentially suspicious behavior, but **no definitive evidence of malicious intent** is present. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Multiple `PowerShell.exe` processes are created with commands checking for the existence of specific files (e.g., `IF EXIST ...`). These are common in scripts for conditional logic but could be part of obfuscation or post-exploitation activities.\n   - **Non-standard file paths** (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`) contain Portuguese terms, which may indicate obfuscation, localization, or legitimate application-specific directories. However, this alone is not conclusive.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - A temporary script file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted, which is typical for PowerShell profile loading but could also be used to evade detection.\n   - The immediate deletion of a script file (`objeto_logico.txt`) might suggest cleanup, but this is common in both benign and malicious contexts.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:**\n   - Legitimate DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender) are loaded. While this could be part of normal system behavior, attackers sometimes abuse legitimate processes (e.g., **DLL hijacking** or **process injection**). However, no anomalous DLLs or unexpected behaviors are reported here.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` events occur. These could indicate benign configuration changes or interaction with system tools, but without context on what is being modified, they remain inconclusive.\n\n5. **cmd.exe and whoami.exe:**\n   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` for file existence checks is standard for scripting. No suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., network connections, payload execution) are observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Unusual Paths:** The presence of non-English, potentially obfuscated paths (e.g., `registro_ativo`, `objeto_logico`) raises questions but is not inherently malicious.\n- **Repetitive PowerShell Activity:** Frequent `PowerShell.exe` process creation and registry modifications could be part of a larger script or tool, but further analysis (e.g., checking for persistence mechanisms, network traffic, or file modifications) would be needed to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events **do not strongly indicate a security threat** but warrant **further investigation** due to:\n- The use of PowerShell for file checks in non-standard directories.\n- The absence of clear benign context for the observed activity (e.g., no associated application or user intent).\n\n**Recommendation:** Monitor for additional indicators (e.g., network connections, unexpected file modifications, user behavior) and correlate with other logs (e.g., firewall, application logs) to rule out obfuscation or lateral movement."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are about processes being accessed, specifically PowerShell.exe. There are several instances of 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)' and 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'. Also, there's a 'Registry value set' event for cmd.exe. Then, there are a few 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell.exe, pointing to various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. \n\nHmm, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The repeated access and creation of PowerShell processes might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious. The 'Registry value set' by cmd.exe might be part of normal operations, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some of the PowerShell processes, they're checking if certain files exist. For example, the command line includes Test-Path with paths like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...\" and exits 0 or 1 based on that. These paths don't look standard; they have names like \"pacote_ativo\" which might be Portuguese for \"active package,\" but that's just a guess. The fact that multiple PowerShell instances are checking for the existence of these files could indicate some kind of probing or checking for the presence of specific files, maybe part of a setup or a script that's trying to determine if certain components are in place.\n\nThen there are the Image Load events. PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll is normal because PowerShell uses the .NET framework. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events might be normal, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a red flag.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. So, the key here is to see if there's a pattern that suggests malicious behavior. The repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific files might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain conditions are met before proceeding. For example, checking if a file exists could be part of a payload that's only executed if certain prerequisites are met. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just a legitimate script.\n\nAnother thing to note is the 'Provider Lifecycle' events. These might be related to PowerShell providers, which are used for interacting with different data stores. But again, that's a normal part of PowerShell's functionality.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes being created and accessed, checking for the existence of non-standard files, and loading .NET DLLs. While some of this is normal, the combination could indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell to perform tasks that are not typically done in a standard environment. However, without more evidence like unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or processes that don't match known good behavior, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut the fact that there are so many Test-Path commands checking for specific files in non-standard directories might be more suspicious. Attackers often use such checks to see if their payloads are present or to avoid detection. If these files are not part of the normal system, this could be a sign of something malicious. However, I can't be 100% sure without more data.\n\nIn the absence of clear indicators of compromise, but considering the repetitive and somewhat unusual file paths, I think this warrants further investigation. Hence, the classification as 'interesting' for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show **PowerShell.exe** being created and accessed (`Process Create`, `Process Access`). PowerShell is a legitimate tool but is often abused by attackers for tasks like file manipulation, command execution, and evasion.\n   - **`Test-Path` commands** in PowerShell scripts are used to check for the existence of files in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\...`, `C:\\modulo_secundario\\...`). These paths are not typical system directories and may indicate probing for specific files (e.g., checking for payloads, configuration files, or dependencies).\n\n2. **Image Load Events:**\n   - PowerShell loads .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`), which is normal behavior. However, the **volume of these events** combined with other activities may suggest an attempt to execute or interact with .NET-based payloads.\n\n3. **Registry Activity:**\n   - A single entry for **`cmd.exe`** performing a **Registry value set** operation. While this could be benign, it is less common than PowerShell-related activity and might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or evade detection.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Several entries with **`Provider Lifecycle`** logs (e.g., PowerShell providers like `FileSystem`, `Registry`). These are typically normal but could be used to interact with non-standard data stores or obfuscate malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators:**\n- **Non-Standard File Paths:** The `Test-Path` commands reference paths with names like `pacote_ativo`, `modulo_secundario`, and `estrutura_comum`, which are not standard system directories. These could be obfuscated or custom-named directories used to hide malicious files.\n- **Repetitive Checks:** Multiple PowerShell instances are checking for the existence of files in different directories. This may indicate a script or payload that is **conditionally executing** based on the presence of specific files (e.g., checking for prerequisites before deployment).\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The logs do not include network activity, user context, or error codes, making it difficult to determine if the activity is legitimate or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **show a pattern of PowerShell being used to probe for specific files** in non-standard directories, combined with .NET DLL loading. While this could be part of a legitimate script or diagnostic tool, the **unusual file paths and repetitive behavior** suggest **potential malicious intent** (e.g., checking for the presence of payloads, configuration files, or dependencies). \n\n**Classification:** **Interesting for further investigation** (likely benign but requires deeper analysis, such as correlating with network traffic, user context, or file integrity checks to confirm legitimacy)."}

Those are legitimate files, so maybe that's just normal activity. But then there are some files in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. It could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily and then clean up.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The script is testing if the file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. But why are there so many different paths? It seems like the attacker is trying to locate a keystroke logging script across multiple directories. That's a common tactic in malware to evade detection by checking multiple locations.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. However, combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger attack. The repeated use of Test-Path with Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests that the attacker is looking for a specific script that might be used for malicious purposes, like keylogging.\n\nThe registry events and process accesses could indicate attempts to modify system settings or access other processes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the combination of file creation\/deletion in temp folders and the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths raises a red flag. It's possible that this is part of a malicious script trying to execute and then clean up traces, which is a common behavior in malware.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while some events are normal (like Defender files), the pattern of creating and deleting files in temp directories, along with the repeated attempts to locate a keystroke logging script, suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns:**\n1. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directories:**\n   - A PowerShell script creates a temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) in the Temp directory and immediately deletes it. This pattern is common in malware to execute payloads temporarily and avoid leaving persistent traces.\n\n2. **Repeated `Test-Path` Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across different paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`, `C:\\objeto_temporario\\...`). This suggests the attacker is **searching for a keystroke logging script** (often used for data exfiltration) across the file system, likely to evade detection by checking multiple locations.\n\n3. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - While some events (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender) are legitimate, the **repetition of `Test-Path` checks** and **file manipulation in Temp directories** deviates from normal system behavior and raises suspicion.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose:**\n   - The scripts appear to perform no obvious benign task (e.g., system maintenance, user-initiated actions). The use of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` (a name strongly associated with malicious activity) further supports this.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- **Malware Evasion Tactics:** The use of temporary files and path obfuscation is a common technique to avoid detection by antivirus tools and system monitoring.\n- **Keystroke Logging:** If `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is found and executed, it could compromise sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credentials).\n- **Potential Command-and-Control (C2) Activity:** The scripts may be part of a larger attack chain, such as exfiltrating data or establishing persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Temp Files:**\n   - Analyze the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1` (if still present) to determine its purpose.\n   - Check for hidden or obfuscated scripts in the directories referenced by `Test-Path`.\n\n2. **Monitor for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Search the file system for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` and analyze its behavior if found.\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies in PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Review PowerShell logs for other suspicious commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process` with unknown URLs).\n\n4. **Network Traffic Analysis:**\n   - Look for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts, which could indicate C2 communication.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs exhibit **behavior consistent with malware reconnaissance or execution**, particularly the repeated search for a keystroke logging script and temporary file manipulation. This warrants immediate investigation to mitigate potential security risks."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDelete. There are several ImageLoad events pointing to .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's normal, but then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting a file might be part of a script execution, but why is it being deleted? Maybe to cover tracks?\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are PowerShell commands checking if certain .ps1 files exist. The paths mentioned, like C:\\tarefa_temporario\\componente_padrao\\entrada_geral\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and similar ones, seem a bit suspicious. The filenames include \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1,\" which could be related to keylogging, a common malicious activity. However, just the name doesn't confirm it's malicious, but it's a red flag.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which might be used for inter-process communication. Not inherently bad, but in combination with other events, it could be part of something malicious.\n\nOther processes like whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe are present. These are common system processes, so their presence alone isn't suspicious. However, the repeated ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events for PowerShell might indicate something is being done with elevated privileges or unusual execution paths.\n\nThe Windows Defender DLLs being loaded (MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll) might be part of legitimate antivirus operations, but if PowerShell is loading them, maybe there's an attempt to bypass security measures.\n\nThe fact that a temporary script file is created and then deleted could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving evidence. The checking of paths for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 might be part of a script that's trying to load a malicious script if it exists. However, the events don't show the actual execution of that script, just the check.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities, loading of various DLLs, creation and deletion of a script file, checking for specific scripts. While some of these could be benign (like normal script testing or system operations), the combination of creating a script file in Temp, deleting it, and checking for keystroke-related scripts raises suspicion. It's not conclusive evidence of a security threat, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd say this is interesting enough for a security team to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in **script obfuscation or cleanup** post-execution, which may indicate **malicious intent** (e.g., executing a script without leaving traces).\n   - **Registry and Process Access:** Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` entries for PowerShell suggest **interaction with system resources** or **attempted privilege escalation**.\n\n2. **Suspicious Script References:**\n   - PowerShell commands check for the existence of `.ps1` files in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\tarefa_temporario\\componente_padrao\\entrada_geral\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1`). The filename `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is **highly indicative of keylogging** (a common malicious payload). While the script itself is not executed in the logs, **the presence of such files** could signal **preparation for lateral movement or data exfiltration**.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell loads multiple `.dll` files (e.g., `urlmon.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While many are legitimate (e.g., .NET Framework components), **unnecessary or repeated loading** of system DLLs could indicate **code injection** or **exploitation**.\n\n4. **Other Processes:**\n   - **`whoami.exe`** and **`calc.exe`** are benign, but their presence alongside PowerShell activity may be part of **post-exploitation reconnaissance** (e.g., checking user privileges or testing system responses).\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`notepad.exe`** are standard processes, but **unusual registry modifications** (e.g., `RegistryEvent` for `notepad.exe`) could hint at **tampering with system configurations**.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - A `.yml.new` file is created for Winlogbeat, which might relate to **configuration changes** or **log collection setup**. While not inherently malicious, it could be part of **log tampering or evasion** if done without authorization.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The logs do not confirm active exploitation, but the **combination of script creation\/deletion, suspicious filenames, and PowerShell activity** raises **concerns about potential malicious behavior** (e.g., initial access, persistence, or data exfiltration).\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** \n  - Temporary script files in `Temp` directories.\n  - Unusual PowerShell commands checking for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`.\n  - Repeated `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` for PowerShell.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Temp Script:** \n   - Check if the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) exists in system backups or memory dumps.\n   - Analyze PowerShell command history for signs of obfuscation or malicious payload execution.\n\n2. **Monitor for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Confirm whether the referenced script exists on the system and its contents.\n   - Check for network traffic related to keystroke data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Audit PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Review PowerShell execution policies and module imports to detect unauthorized scripts or modules.\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **EDR solutions** to track script execution paths.\n\n4. **Review Winlogbeat Configuration:**\n   - Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of legitimate configuration updates and not tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not definitively prove a security breach, the **suspicious script behavior and PowerShell activity** are **red flags** that merit closer scrutiny. Further analysis of system artifacts, network traffic, and user behavior is required to determine if this represents **legitimate activity or a potential threat**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll scan through the entries to see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up a tool, but maybe suspicious if it's unexpected. Then there's a bunch of powershell.exe processes being accessed, which is common but could be part of something malicious. There's also whoami.exe being run, which is typically used to check user context, so that's normal. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making network connections is normal, but svchost might be hosting services that are communicating. However, the repetition of network events might be normal browser activity. \n\nThen, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that includes \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". That's just a recursive directory listing, which is a standard command. But then there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some .NET frameworks and Windows Defender components. Those are legitimate, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell to inject malicious code, so the presence of multiple image loads might be a red flag. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the first event is a file created by winlogbeat.exe. If that's part of a legitimate installation, maybe it's okay. However, if there's no other suspicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. But the repeated PowerShell access and image loads could be part of a script or exploit. \n\nAlso, the command line in one of the PowerShell processes is \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse...}\". That's a common command for exploring the file system, which might be benign. However, if combined with other suspicious activities, it might be a sign of reconnaissance. \n\nI need to check if there's any pattern that suggests malicious behavior. The presence of multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell might indicate that it's being monitored or manipulated. But without more context, like unusual parameters or unexpected network destinations, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs are normal, but if they're being loaded from unexpected locations or if there's a lot of them, that could be a sign. However, in this case, the paths are standard Windows directories. \n\nThe only potentially suspicious event is the first one with winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file. That could be part of a configuration change, but maybe not harmful. However, if that's the only event, it's not enough. The rest of the logs don't show obvious signs of compromise. \n\nSo, putting it all together: there's one possibly benign event and a lot of normal system activity. Without more indicators like unusual network traffic, unauthorized access, or malicious payloads, it's probably not interesting enough for an investigation. Unless the user has specific context that winlogbeat's activity is suspicious, but based solely on the logs provided, I think it's not a high priority.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of interest, but **no definitive evidence of malicious behavior**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - A `.yml.new` file is created in the `Downloads` directory by `winlogbeat.exe`. This is likely part of a **legitimate configuration update** (e.g., modifying a configuration file for Winlogbeat, a log shipper). No suspicious parameters or unexpected behavior are noted here.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple `ImageLoad` events for PowerShell loading **legitimate .NET DLLs** (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clr.dll`, `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender). These are standard for PowerShell operations and do not indicate malware.\n   - A PowerShell process runs a recursive directory listing (`ls -recurse`), which is a **common benign command** for exploration or scripting.\n\n3. **Network Activity:**\n   - `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` show network connections. These are **normal for browser activity** and system services, respectively. No unusual destinations or protocols are mentioned.\n\n4. **Process Access:**\n   - Repeated `ProcessAccess` events for PowerShell are likely due to **monitoring or logging** (e.g., by security tools). No evidence of unauthorized access or tampering is present.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The logs reflect **normal system behavior** with no clear signs of compromise (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized file modifications, or suspicious process interactions).\n- The only potentially notable event (the `.yml.new` file creation) is **context-dependent**. If Winlogbeat is not expected to modify files in the `Downloads` directory, further investigation into the file's contents and user context might be warranted. However, based solely on the logs provided, **no immediate action is required**.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- If the file creation by Winlogbeat is unexpected or the user has reason to suspect tampering, inspect the file's contents and audit user activity around the time of the event.\n- Otherwise, the logs appear to represent **routine system operations**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes involved. The first two events show a file being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces. The file name has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. \n\nThen there are several entries with the \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. The command line for these processes is using ls, get-childitem, and ngci -recurse. These commands are typically used to list files recursively, which might be part of enumerating the file system. However, the repetition of these events might indicate some automated process or script running multiple times, which could be benign if it's part of a legitimate tool, but suspicious if it's part of an attack.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file in the Downloads directory called \"estrutura_secundario.txt\". Not sure what that's for, but maybe it's just a normal file. However, there's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of a legitimate monitoring setup. But the fact that there are multiple file creations and deletions, along with registry changes, could be indicative of something more malicious.\n\nThe presence of the ImageLoad event pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but if there's any unusual activity around that, it could be a red flag. However, in this case, it's just a standard Defender component.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of PowerShell creating and deleting scripts, repeated file system enumeration commands, and the creation of temporary files could be signs of a malicious actor trying to execute scripts and clean up after themselves. However, some of the events might be part of legitimate activities, like using PowerShell for administrative tasks or Winlogbeat for logging. The key here is the pattern of creating and deleting files quickly, which is often seen in attacks. But I'm not 100% sure, so I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show file creation\/deletion in Temp directory (common in malware), repeated 'get-childitem -recurse' commands (file enumeration), and registry modifications. While some activity may be benign, the pattern of temporary script creation and deletion raises suspicion of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
