That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably benign. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, so I need to check the command lines.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a PowerShell command that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That might be a red flag because searching for passwords in files could indicate an attempt to find credentials. The command is run multiple times, which might be part of a script or repeated checks.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate system files, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a sign of something.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path looks legitimate, but sometimes attackers might use trusted directories to hide malicious files. However, just loading a legitimate DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a powershell command using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. This could be a red flag if it's part of a password-gathering attempt. The command is looking for 'pass' in various file types, which might indicate someone is trying to find credentials. But it's also possible that this is a legitimate user's script, though it's a bit unusual.\n\nThen there are multiple svchost.exe and other processes like Calculator.exe and chrome.exe performing registry value sets. These are common system processes, and registry changes can be normal, but if there's a pattern or multiple changes, it might be worth looking into. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe interesting part is the powershell.exe process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store data, but again, it could be a legitimate user action. However, combined with the password search command, it might suggest someone is trying to collect sensitive information.\n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of normal monitoring, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nPutting it all together: the password search command in powershell, combined with file creation in AppData, might indicate a potential insider threat or an attempt to exfiltrate data.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the entries to spot any suspicious patterns.\n\nThe first event is about chrome.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. The file path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Wait, Windows Defender's own DLLs are usually signed and legitimate, but sometimes malicious software can masquerade as legitimate files. However, just loading a DLL from that path might not be suspicious on its own. But I should check if there's anything else.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of registry changes could be normal, but if it's a lot, maybe it's trying to modify settings. However, chrome.exe is a common process, so maybe it's just normal behavior. But I need to check for other signs.\n\nNext, there are several network connections detected from chrome.exe. Multiple network connections might be normal, but if they're going to unusual destinations or in a short time, that could be suspicious. However, the data here doesn't specify the destination IPs or URLs, so I can't tell yet.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_logico.txt. Creating a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe. Also, another file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be normal if they're configuring it, but the presence of multiple file creations could be worth noting.\n\nLooking further, there's a process named whoami.exe, which is typically used to display user information. That's normal, but if it's being used in a script for malicious purposes, it could be part of something else. Then there's a cmd.exe command that deletes scheduled tasks. The command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack, which is suspicious.\n\nAnother event is schtasks.exe being used to delete a task named \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". Scheduled task deletions could be normal, but combined with other events, like the deletion of tasks and the creation of files, it might indicate someone trying to remove traces of their activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so a lot of activity here could be a red flag. However, it's also a common administrative tool, so context is needed.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files might be part of a legitimate monitoring setup, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that's a concern.\n\nPutting this all together: the deletion of scheduled tasks, multiple registry changes, network connections, and PowerShell activity might indicate an attack. However, without more context like the destination of network traffic or the content of the created files, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the combination of these events does raise some flags. I should consider this batch as potentially interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event log contains several activities that warrant further investigation due to potential security implications. Here's a structured analysis of the suspicious patterns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Process Behavior from Legitimate Tools**\n- **`chrome.exe` loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory**  \n  - **Event**: `Image loaded` from `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll`.  \n  - **Risk**: While Windows Defender's DLLs are typically legitimate, this could be a **DLL hijacking** attempt if the file is not properly signed or if it deviates from expected behavior (e.g., unexpected memory usage, network activity).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Excessive Registry Modifications**\n- **Multiple `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` entries** with `Registry value set` or `Registry object added\/deleted`.  \n  - **Risk**: Frequent registry changes by non-administrative processes (e.g., `chrome.exe`) may indicate **tampering with system settings** or **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup entries, service configurations).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Network Activity from `chrome.exe`**\n- **Repeated `Network connection` events** from `chrome.exe`.  \n  - **Risk**: If these connections are to **unusual or high-risk domains\/IPs** (not specified here), this could indicate **data exfiltration** or **communication with a C2 server**.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Suspicious Scheduled Task Deletions**\n- **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` commands** deleting tasks named:  \n  - `\"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\"`, `\"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\"`, and `\"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\"`.  \n  - **Risk**: Deleting scheduled tasks may be part of **cleaning up post-exploitation artifacts**, which is a common tactic in **malware or insider threat scenarios**.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. PowerShell and CMD Activity**\n- **`powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`** executing commands to:  \n  - Modify registry values.  \n  - Delete scheduled tasks.  \n  - **Risk**: PowerShell is often used for **post-exploitation activities**, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement. The use of `cmd.exe` to delete tasks may also indicate **manual cleanup** by an attacker.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. File Creation in User Directories**\n- **`powershell.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`** creating files in user directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_logico.txt`).  \n  - **Risk**: While file creation in Downloads is common, if these files are **malicious payloads** or **logs from unauthorized tools**, this could indicate **data collection or exfiltration**.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. `whoami.exe` and `svchost.exe` Activity**\n- **`whoami.exe`** executing a `Process Create` event.  \n  - **Risk**: Typically benign, but if used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it may be part of **user enumeration or privilege escalation**.  \n- **`svchost.exe`** modifying registry objects.  \n  - **Risk**: `svchost.exe` is a legitimate host process, but unexpected registry changes may indicate **malware hiding in system processes**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n- **High-Risk Indicators**:  \n  - Deletion of scheduled tasks (potential cleanup of malicious activity).  \n  - Excessive registry modifications by non-system processes.  \n  - Network activity from `chrome.exe` (context needed for risk assessment).  \n- **Medium-Risk Indicators**:  \n  - PowerShell\/CMD usage for suspicious tasks.  \n  - File creation in user directories (context needed).  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Network Logs**: Investigate the destination IPs\/URLs of `chrome.exe`'s network connections.  \n2. **Analyze File Contents**: Check the contents of files created by `powershell.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` for malicious payloads.  \n3. **Check Registry Changes**: Audit registry modifications to identify unauthorized configurations or persistence mechanisms.  \n4. **Monitor User Behavior**: Investigate the user (`fiddelis`) for other anomalous activities (e.g., lateral movement, privilege escalation).  \n5. **Check for Malware Signatures**: Scan the system for malware using endpoint detection tools (e.g., EDR, antivirus).  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The event log suggests **potential compromise or insider activity**. Immediate investigation is recommended to determine the scope of the threat and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The first event is schtasks.exe deleting a scheduled task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task could be part of a cleanup after an attack.

That might be an attempt to remove evidence. Also, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe making registry changes. The use of WMIC with the delete command on notepad.exe could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's a net user \/del command to delete users, which is a red flag. Deleting user accounts could be part of covering tracks or removing access points. The presence of multiple process accesses and registry modifications by powershell and cmd suggests someone is trying to alter system settings or hide their activities.\n\nThe fact that there's a scheduled task deletion followed by user account deletions and registry changes points towards malicious activity.

Some of these are common, like cmd and powershell, but their commands might indicate something. \n\nI notice several instances of 'net user ... \/del \/domain' commands. That's deleting user accounts on a domain. That's a red flag because deleting user accounts isn't typical in normal operations. Then there's 'sc delete win32times' which is deleting a service. That could be part of a cleanup after an attack or trying to remove something malicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying system settings. The fact that multiple processes are accessing the registry might indicate someone trying to alter system behavior.\n\nThe 'User Account Management' and 'Security Group Management' events might be normal if there's administrative activity, but combined with the other commands, it could be part of a larger attack.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's deleting temporary files. The command line shows it's trying to delete some files in the Temp directory. That might be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers use temp files to hide malicious stuff. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. The registry events could be part of normal operations, but if they're modifying keys related to startup or system settings, that's a red flag. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed, so that's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is just checking the user, so that's benign. But the repeated entries of powershell.exe with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might be related to PowerShell's own operations, but maybe not harmful on their own.\n\nThe interesting part is the image loaded events. PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell when running .NET code. But then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script policy test file. Creating and deleting it quickly might be part of a test, but could also be a sign of obfuscation or trying to execute scripts without leaving traces. \n\nAlso, the cmd.exe process that deletes files might be part of cleanup after executing a script. But why would someone delete those files? If it's part of a legitimate process, like a temporary script, maybe. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, registry changes, and file operations could indicate someone is trying to execute scripts and then cover their tracks by deleting the files.\n\nAnother thing is the use of \"del\" command in cmd.exe with redirection to nul, which is a way to suppress output. That's common in scripts to avoid leaving logs. But again, it's not definitively malicious without more context.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry events and image loads might be part of a larger attack, like modifying registry keys to persist after reboot or loading malicious DLLs. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious DLLs being loaded, just standard .NET ones.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch has a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The file creation and deletion in Temp, along with multiple PowerShell and registry events, could be part of a script execution attempt. However, without more evidence like network activity, unusual processes, or specific registry key changes, it's a bit inconclusive. But the fact that the user is asking if it's interesting suggests that there might be a need for further investigation on these logs. So, I'd say it's worth looking into more, hence \"interesting\" but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of key observations:\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A PowerShell process creates a temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) in the `Temp` directory and then deletes it immediately. This pattern is often used to execute scripts without leaving persistent evidence, which could indicate obfuscation or evasion tactics.\n\n2. **cmd.exe File Deletion**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process executes commands to delete temporary files (`*.opf.ps1`, `*.opf`) in the `Temp` directory. While this could be part of legitimate cleanup, the suppression of output (`>nul 2>&1`) and the use of temporary files are common in scripts designed to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Frequent PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell processes loading .NET assemblies (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`). While normal for PowerShell, the combination of file creation\/deletion and registry modifications could suggest script execution or payload delivery.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Repeated registry events (e.g., `Registry Value Set`) involving PowerShell processes may indicate attempts to modify system settings, persistence mechanisms, or execution policies. However, the specific registry keys are not detailed, so further analysis is needed.\n\n### **Benign Activity**\n- **Whoami.exe**: A standard tool for checking user context, which is harmless.\n- **.NET DLL Loads**: PowerShell naturally loads .NET assemblies during script execution, which is typical and not inherently malicious.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not definitively indicate malicious activity, the combination of **temporary file creation\/deletion**, **PowerShell script execution**, and **registry modifications** raises **red flags** that warrant deeper investigation. These behaviors could be part of a **script-based attack** (e.g., downloading and executing payloads) or a **legitimate process** (e.g., a test or cleanup task). Further analysis (e.g., correlating with network traffic, checking file contents, or examining registry key changes) is necessary to determine if this is a false positive or a genuine threat.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting** – the activity is not clearly malicious but exhibits patterns commonly seen in adversarial operations."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a Pipe Created event. That's not necessarily bad, but maybe part of normal operations. Then there's an Engine Lifecycle task, which might be related to some software initializing. The third event is Image loaded for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems legitimate.\n\nNext, a File created in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for temporary files, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then a Registry value set event. Registry changes can be risky if done by unexpected processes. However, multiple entries here show Registry events for different processes like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe. These are standard Windows processes, so their registry changes might be normal.\n\nThere are several Process accessed events for powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The repetition here might indicate something, but not sure yet. Then there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably benign.\n\nLooking at the file paths, one mentions winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The file created there might be part of normal operations if someone is setting up monitoring. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell could be a red flag. Maybe someone is trying to execute scripts or access sensitive processes.\n\nWait, there's also an entry for calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL for Internet Explorer, so that's normal. The same with Calculator.exe. The svchost.exe entries are part of Windows services, so their registry changes might be routine.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell and the Registry changes. However, since the events don't show clear malicious activity like downloading files, executing payloads, or unusual network activity, it's possible that this is just normal system behavior or part of a legitimate script. But the high frequency of PowerShell events accessing processes might warrant further investigation. However, without more context, it's not conclusive enough to be highly suspicious.

Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file makes sense. Not suspicious here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is accessed. But there's no file info. Maybe a normal process, but PowerShell is often used for malicious stuff. However, just accessing it isn't enough. Need more context.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is executed. That's a standard tool to check user identity. Not suspicious on its own. The command line shows it's run from the system32 directory, which is normal.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access. Still no file info. Maybe part of normal operations, but maybe not. But without more, hard to tell.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe setting registry values. These are typical Windows processes. Calculator.exe is a legitimate app, so that's normal. ApplicationFrameHost is part of the Windows UI, so setting registry values might be part of normal functioning.\n\nChrome.exe has several DNS queries and network connections. That's expected for a browser. Multiple DNS queries could be normal if the user is browsing multiple sites. Network connections are standard. However, if there's an unusual number or to suspicious IPs, that's a red flag. But the logs don't mention any specific IPs or domains, just the rule names.\n\nPutting it all together: The only potentially interesting thing is the first event with winlogbeat creating a file. But that's a normal operation. The rest are all standard processes doing typical actions. No signs of malware, unauthorized access, or suspicious activities. So maybe this isn't interesting. But wait, the first event is about a config file. Maybe the presence of a .yml.new file could indicate a configuration change. But unless there's something wrong with the config, it's just a normal file creation. Without more context, like failed attempts or unusual paths, it's hard to say. The other events don't show any anomalies. So overall, I think this batch isn't interesting.
