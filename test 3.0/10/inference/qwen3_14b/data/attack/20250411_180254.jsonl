{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, systeminfo.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, WmiPrvSE.exe, reg.exe, and others. Some of these are common, like chrome and notepad, but others like powershell and cmd can be used for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks. There are several Registry value set events, which could indicate changes to the registry, maybe by malware. Also, Process Create events for systeminfo.exe and reg.exe. The command line for one cmd.exe is \"systeminfo & reg query HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum\". That seems like someone is gathering system information and querying the registry, which might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThen there are Image Load events. For systeminfo.exe, amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are loaded. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, but MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. However, sometimes malware can load DLLs from unexpected locations. Wait, the paths here are C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... That seems legitimate. But I should check if those paths are standard. MpOAV.dll is part of the Windows Defender Platform, so maybe that's normal.\n\nAnother Image Load event for calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for Internet Explorer. But then there's Calculator.exe also loading urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. Maybe that's a typo or a renamed executable. However, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is correct. But if the process is named Calculator.exe, that might be a red flag. However, sometimes processes can be renamed, but I need to check if that's common.\n\nThere are also File Create events for svchost.exe creating Parameters.evtx and State.evtx in the Windows Event Logs. That might be normal, as svchost.exe is a Windows process that hosts various system services. But creating event logs could be part of normal operations or maybe something else.\n\nLooking for unusual combinations. The cmd.exe running systeminfo and reg query might be part of a script to gather information. The powershell.exe and registry events could be modifying settings. Also, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that processes are being monitored or manipulated.\n\nAnother point is the presence of WmiPrvSE.exe, which is the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider process. It's used for WMI queries, which can be legitimate but also abused by malware. The command line here is \"-secured -Embedding\", which might be normal. The Image Load of wmiutils.dll is part of the WMI components, so that seems okay.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its setup. But if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of someone trying to configure it for data collection, which isn't necessarily malicious but depends on context.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several events that are normal for system operations. However, the repeated registry modifications, the use of cmd and powershell for system info and registry queries, and the Image Load events might be part of a reconnaissance phase. But without more context, like unexpected network activity or unusual file modifications, it's hard to say if this is malicious. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses could be indicative of something that warrants further investigation. So, I'd lean towards this being interesting for investigation but not definitively malicious without more data.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries include a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of reconnaissance or system manipulation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **System Reconnaissance:**\n   - **`cmd.exe`** and **`reg.exe`** executing commands like `systeminfo` and querying the registry (`HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum`). These actions are typical for gathering system information but could be part of initial reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events involving **`powershell.exe`**, **`cmd.exe`**, and **`conhost.exe`**. While registry changes are normal for system configuration, frequent or unexpected modifications may indicate tampering.\n\n3. **Suspicious Process Names:**\n   - **`Calculator.exe`** loading **`urlmon.dll`** (a legitimate DLL) from **`C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll`**. However, the process name **`Calculator.exe`** is unusual (standard is **`calc.exe`**), which could indicate a renamed malicious executable or a misconfiguration.\n\n4. **Windows Defender-Related Activity:**\n   - **`systeminfo.exe`** loading **`amsi.dll`** and **`MpOAV.dll`** (both legitimate components of Windows Defender). No immediate red flags here, but the paths are standard.\n\n5. **WMI Provider Activity:**\n   - **`WmiPrvSE.exe`** (Windows Management Instrumentation Provider) running with flags `-secured -Embedding`. This is normal for WMI operations but could be abused by malware for persistence or remote execution.\n\n6. **File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`:**\n   - A **`.yml.new`** configuration file is created in the **`Downloads`** directory. While **`winlogbeat.exe`** is a legitimate log shipper, this action could be part of a benign setup or an attempt to inject malicious configurations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Unusual Process Names:** The use of **`Calculator.exe`** instead of **`calc.exe`** warrants further inspection.\n- **Frequent Registry Modifications:** If these changes are not documented or expected, they could signal tampering.\n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional data (e.g., network traffic, file hashes, user context), itâ€™s challenging to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log batch contains **normal system activity** mixed with **potential indicators of reconnaissance or system manipulation**. While no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the combination of registry changes, process anomalies, and WMI activity **merits further investigation**. A deeper analysis of file hashes, network behavior, and user context would be necessary to determine if this is benign or part of an attack chain. \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** due to the presence of suspicious process names and registry modifications, but not conclusive of malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are about 'Registry value set' events, which are part of the RegistryEvent rule. The processes involved are mostly 'chrome.exe' and a few others like 'Calculator.exe', 'winlogbeat.exe', and 'powershell.exe'. The 'file' field is usually 'None' except for a couple of entries.\n\nNow, the two entries that stand out are the 'Image loaded' events. One is 'amsi.dll' from System32, which is a legitimate file. The other is 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. Both are known good files, so that might not be a problem. But wait, why is chrome.exe loading these? Maybe it's normal, but sometimes malicious software can mimic legitimate processes.\n\nThen there's the 'File created' events. One is a new .yml file for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be part of a setup or configuration change. The other is a text file created by powershell.exe. That could be benign, like a user creating a file, but sometimes PowerShell is used in attacks.\n\nThe majority of events are 'Registry value set' by chrome.exe. While registry changes can be normal, a high number of such events might indicate something like a registry modification by malware, especially if it's persisting or changing settings. However, Chrome might legitimately modify the registry for updates or settings. But the repetition here is a lot. Let me count: there are about 15 registry events for chrome.exe. That's a lot. Even if some are normal, that frequency might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file could be part of a legitimate monitoring setup, but if it's unexpected, it might be an indicator. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The 'powershell.exe' creating a text file is common, but again, depends on the context.\n\nPutting this all together: the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe could be a red flag. Even though some of the other events are normal, the volume and type of registry changes might indicate malicious activity. However, without more data, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's a bit hard to be certain. But given the repetition and the fact that registry changes are often used in attacks for persistence, this batch seems interesting enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Registry value set' events from chrome.exe (15 instances) suggest potential registry manipulation, which is often used for persistence or configuration changes by malware. While some events involve legitimate files (e.g., amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), the high frequency of registry modifications by a browser process raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
