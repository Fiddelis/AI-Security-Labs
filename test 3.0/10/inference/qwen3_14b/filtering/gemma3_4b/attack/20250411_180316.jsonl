So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Some of these are normal processes. But then there's a whoami.exe command, which is usually benign, just shows user info.

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. \n\nHmm, I notice that whoami.exe is being executed a few times. That's a command-line utility that displays the current user's identity. While normal, if it's run multiple times, maybe it's part of a larger attack, like checking privileges. But alone, it's not too suspicious.\n\nThen there's the cmd.exe commands. One of them is using the copy command to replace sethc.exe with sethc_backup.exe. Wait, sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys shortcut. Replacing it with a backup could be a sign of a malicious replacement, like a backdoor. That's a red flag. Another cmd.exe command is deleting a scheduled task named \"win32times\". Deleting tasks might be to remove evidence or prevent detection. \n\nAlso, there's a schtasks.exe process that's deleting the same task. Scheduled tasks being manipulated could be part of persistence mechanisms. The fact that there are multiple Process Create and Registry value set events might indicate changes to the system configuration or attempts to hide the attack.\n\nPowerShell is used several times, which is common but can be abused for malicious activities. However, without specific commands or indicators of compromise, it's harder to tell. The repeated access to processes and registry changes might be part of an attack chain, like establishing persistence or modifying system settings.\n\nThe presence of Image loaded events for taskschd.dll seems normal as it's a legitimate Windows component. However, combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger pattern. \n\nPutting it all together: the replacement of sethc.exe, deletion of scheduled tasks, and multiple registry changes could indicate an attempt to compromise the system.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. Normally, it's a legitimate file. But why is chrome.exe loading it? That might be normal if Chrome is interacting with Defender, but I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe and conhost.exe setting registry values. Registry changes can be a red flag, especially if they're modifying keys related to security or system settings. However, without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to say. But multiple processes doing this might indicate something.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines here are a bit vague. One entry has \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems like a no-op, but maybe that's just a test. Another entry shows a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to testing script execution policies, but the presence of a temporary script could be suspicious if it's executing malicious code.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET components, so that's normal. However, the repeated loading might be part of a legitimate process or could be an indicator of something else, but I don't see immediate red flags here.\n\nThe user is asking about the entire batch. Are there any patterns? There's a lot of activity around PowerShell and registry changes. The creation of a temporary script file is notable. Also, the fact that chrome.exe is loading Defender DLLs might be benign, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger picture.\n\nBut I need to check if this is a known benign scenario. For example, sometimes security software might inject into processes or load DLLs for scanning. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications and PowerShell activities might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or execute scripts, which could be part of an attack.\n\nAnother point: the file created in Temp is named in a way that suggests a script policy test. If this is part of a legitimate test, it's okay, but if it's part of an attack, it's a problem. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but the presence of such a file in Temp is something that might warrant further investigation.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple registry modifications, PowerShell activity, and a temporary script file. While some of these could be normal, the combination might indicate suspicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is likely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs), warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlights**\n1. **Unusual DLL Loading by Chrome**:\n   - **`chrome.exe`** loading **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface) is **not inherently malicious**, but **chrome.exe typically does not interact directly with Defender components**. This could indicate:\n     - **Malware injection** (e.g., a malicious process masquerading as Chrome).\n     - **Defender heuristic analysis** (unlikely without additional context).\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Frequent creation\/access of `powershell.exe`** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1` in `Temp`) suggests **script execution**, which is common in both legitimate tasks and attacks.\n   - The temporary script name (`PSScriptPolicyTest`) may hint at **script execution policy testing**, but **no content or command-line arguments** are provided, making it ambiguous.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe`** modifying registry keys (e.g., `FileCreate`, `ImageLoad`). **Registry changes** are often used by malware to **persist or disable security features**, though benign processes (e.g., updates) also modify the registry.\n\n4. **File Creation in Temp Directory**:\n   - **`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`**:\n     - **Temporary files** are common, but the **lack of context** (e.g., script content, user interaction) raises concerns. This could be:\n       - A **legitimate test** (e.g., PowerShell execution policy validation).\n       - A **malicious payload** (e.g., a dropper or script for lateral movement).\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **.NET DLL Loads** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are **normal for PowerShell** when executing .NET-based scripts.\n- **`MpOAV.dll`** is a legitimate Defender component, though its loading by Chrome requires deeper inspection.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Context**:\n   - Check **process trees** (e.g., is `chrome.exe` parented by a suspicious process?).\n   - Analyze **registry key modifications** (e.g., are they related to security settings or user preferences?).\n   - Inspect the **content of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`** (if accessible).\n\n2. **Check for Anomalies**:\n   - Use **EDR\/XDR tools** to detect:\n     - **Unusual process behavior** (e.g., Chrome loading Defender DLLs).\n     - **PowerShell command-line arguments** (e.g., `-EncodedCommand` for obfuscated scripts).\n     - **Lateral movement** (e.g., network activity tied to the Temp script).\n\n3. **User Behavior**:\n   - Determine if **`fiddelis`** is a legitimate user or if the account was compromised.\n   - Check for **unauthorized access** (e.g., MFA bypass, phishing).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **some activity is legitimate**, the combination of **unusual DLL loading, PowerShell script creation, and registry modifications** raises **red flags**. This batch **merits further investigation** to rule out malicious activity, especially if the system is part of a critical infrastructure or sensitive environment."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a File Delete logged by powershell.exe, deleting a script file in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe it's malicious. However, I need to check other events.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, all involving powershell.exe with command_line as 'powershell.exe & {}'. These might be normal operations, but the repetition could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event shows a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably legitimate, part of normal operations. But then there's a Pipe Created event and a File created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the command lines of some powershell.exe processes, there are paths that seem to be checking for specific batch files in various directories. For example, checking if \"C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" exists. The paths have some odd structures with '..' which might be trying to navigate directories, but that's common in scripts. However, the presence of multiple such checks could indicate an attempt to locate or execute scripts in different locations, which might be part of a malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are several Registry value set events, which could be benign, but if combined with other actions, might indicate configuration changes. However, without seeing actual malicious registry changes, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key point here is the combination of events. The deletion of a temporary PowerShell script, followed by multiple PowerShell processes checking for existence of various batch files. This might be part of a script trying to locate and execute other scripts, which is a common tactic in malware. However, the presence of only checks (using Test-Path) without actual execution isn't enough to confirm malicious intent. But the fact that there are multiple such checks across different directories might be suspicious, especially if they are looking for scripts that could be part of a payload.\n\nAdditionally, the initial deletion of the script file might be an attempt to clean up after itself, which is a common behavior in malware. However, without more evidence like actual execution of malicious code, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch does show some unusual activity, but it's not conclusive. The confidence level would be moderate. It's interesting enough to warrant further investigation but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of benign and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **File Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`objeto_ativo_script.bat`) is deleted from the `%TEMP%` directory. While temporary file cleanup is normal, deletion of a script immediately after execution could indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n2. **Repetitive PowerShell Checks:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute `Test-Path` commands to check for the existence of batch files (`*.script.bat`) across non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral\\registro_auxiliar\\..\\estrutura_comum\\modulo_base_script.bat`). The use of `..` in paths suggests directory traversal, which is common in scripts but may hint at evasion techniques or probing for payloads.\n\n3. **Lack of Execution:**\n   - None of the logs confirm execution of the identified `.bat` files, only checks for their existence. This could be part of a pre-operational survey (e.g., checking for prerequisites) rather than direct malicious activity.\n\n4. **Benign Processes:**\n   - Events involving `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) and standard PowerShell operations (e.g., `StartupProfileData`) are likely legitimate.\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n- **Unusual Path Patterns:** The repeated use of `Test-Path` with non-standard, deeply nested paths might indicate an attempt to locate or evade detection of malicious scripts.\n- **Script Deletion:** Deleting a script post-execution could be an attempt to remove evidence, though this behavior alone is not conclusive.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **moderately suspicious** but not definitively malicious. The combination of script deletion, repetitive file checks, and non-standard paths warrants further investigation (e.g., inspecting the contents of the deleted script, monitoring for subsequent execution of the `.bat` files, or analyzing network activity). \n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium** (interesting enough for investigation but not conclusive evidence of compromise). \n\n**Recommendation:** Correlate these logs with additional context (e.g., file content analysis, user behavior, network traffic) to determine if this represents benign activity or part of a larger attack chain."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but it's also a common vector for attacks. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a PowerShell command that checks if a specific batch file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present. Not sure yet, but maybe benign.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for .dll files, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll might be relevant. However, that's part of normal operation, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nThere's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for temporary scripts, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly could be a red flag. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell. Also, there's another file created in the Downloads folder named 'elemento_padrao.txt'. That might be a normal file, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are several events related to Chrome.exe modifying registry values. A lot of registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're modifying keys that affect browser behavior. However, Chrome might legitimately make registry changes for updates or extensions. But multiple entries here might indicate something more.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell command lines again, they all seem to be checking the existence of certain batch files. The paths mentioned, like 'modulo_ativo', 'componente_temporario', etc., are in Portuguese, which might be part of the system's naming convention. But the fact that these paths are being checked repeatedly could be part of a larger script or process that's trying to locate certain files.\n\nAnother thing is the 'Pipe Created' event for PowerShell. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there are multiple pipes created, it might indicate something like a malicious process communicating with another.\n\nHowever, I don't see any obvious signs of malware, such as unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or privilege escalation. The events are mostly related to normal operations, like script execution, file creation\/deletion, and registry changes. The repeated checks for batch files might be part of a legitimate process, like a deployment or configuration management script.\n\nBut the high number of Chrome-related registry changes could be a point of concern. If an attacker is trying to modify Chrome's behavior through the registry, that could be a sign of a compromise. However, without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to confirm.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some suspicious elements like the numerous registry changes and the PowerShell scripts checking for batch files, there's not enough concrete evidence to label this as a clear security threat. However, it's worth further investigation to determine if these activities are part of a legitimate process or if they're indicative of a potential attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Use of PowerShell:** Multiple entries involve PowerShell executing commands to check the existence of batch files (e.g., `Test-Path` with paths like `modulo_ativo`, `componente_temporario`). While this could be part of legitimate automation, the repetitive nature and use of obfuscated paths (in Portuguese) warrant scrutiny.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in the PowerShell directory, and another script (`elemento_padrao.txt`) is saved in the Downloads folder. This could be benign, but the absence of clear context (e.g., user interaction) raises questions.\n\n2. **DLL Loading:**\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs:** `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` are loaded. While this is normal for Defender's operation, the frequency of such events could indicate an attempt to bypass or interact with security software.\n\n3. **Chrome Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Numerous Registry Changes:** Chrome.exe is associated with multiple `Registry value set` events. This could indicate legitimate updates or extensions, but excessive or unexplained changes might suggest tampering (e.g., altering browser settings for persistence or data exfiltration).\n\n4. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `Pipe Created` event for PowerShell is logged. While pipes are common in inter-process communication, this could be a red flag if tied to covert data transfer.\n\n### **Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Lack of Context:** No clear user interaction or application context is provided for the PowerShell scripts or Chrome activity.\n- **Repetitive Checks:** The repeated use of `Test-Path` across different paths might indicate a script probing for specific files, possibly part of a larger attack (e.g., checking for prerequisites before payload execution).\n- **Registry Activity:** Unusual volume of Chrome-related registry changes without explicit justification could point to unauthorized modifications.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate PowerShell Scripts:** Analyze the contents of created files (e.g., `elemento_padrao.txt`) and correlate with other system logs for signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Monitor Chrome Behavior:** Audit the specific registry keys modified by Chrome to ensure they align with expected behavior (e.g., updates, extensions).\n- **Check for Lateral Movement:** Investigate if the PowerShell activity is part of a broader campaign, such as credential harvesting or network reconnaissance.\n- **Verify Legitimacy of Paths:** Confirm whether the paths checked by PowerShell (e.g., `modulo_ativo`) are part of legitimate system directories or custom configurations.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the combination of PowerShell scripting, suspicious registry changes, and lack of clear context **justifies further investigation**. These events could represent benign operations, but they also align with tactics used in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware campaigns. Prioritizing these logs for deeper analysis is advisable. \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for further investigation**—not conclusive evidence of compromise, but warrants closer examination."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. There's a bunch of PowerShell.exe processes, which is common but can be a red flag if there's suspicious activity. The first few entries show 'Registry value set' events, which might be normal, but I need to check for anything unusual.\n\nLooking at the third event, there's a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content to create and modify batch files. The paths here are a bit odd with lots of '..' which might be trying to navigate directories in a way that's not straightforward. The content being set is \"dir\", which is a simple command, but the creation of these files in various locations could be part of something larger.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might indicate that the system is scanning, but it's also possible that malware is trying to bypass detection.\n\nThe later events have 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be related to PowerShell's internal operations. The command lines here are similar, creating batch files in different directories. The repetition of these actions across multiple paths could be an attempt to persist or execute commands.\n\nThe last event mentions a file created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script. This is a common place for malware to drop temporary files. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a legitimate test, but combined with the other activities, it's suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell activities creating files, modifying the registry, and loading DLLs. While some of these could be legitimate, the pattern of creating numerous files in various locations, along with the use of PowerShell for these tasks, raises concerns. The confidence is medium because while there are indicators of potential malicious activity, more context would be needed to confirm. However, given the repetition and the use of Temp directory, it's leaning towards suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a pattern of **PowerShell activity** that raises **moderate suspicion** of potential malicious behavior. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell commands using `New-Item` and `Set-Content` to **create and modify batch files** (`*.bat`) in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`).\n   - The use of `..` in file paths (e.g., `C:\\elemento_geral\\elemento_auxiliar\\..`) suggests **directory traversal**, potentially obfuscating the true location of created files.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Creation**:\n   - A file is created in the **Windows Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`), a common location for **malware to drop temporary files**.\n   - The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1` resembles a **PowerShell script** that might be testing execution policies or bypassing restrictions.\n\n3. **DLL Loading**:\n   - Multiple entries show **.NET runtime DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) being loaded. While legitimate, this could indicate **exploitation of .NET components** or attempts to **bypass security mechanisms**.\n   - The presence of **Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll** (Microsoft Antimalware Platform) might suggest **antivirus evasion** or **malware attempting to interact with security software**.\n\n4. **Repetitive \"Provider\/Engine Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - The command-line patterns (e.g., `New-Item \"C:\\...\\modulo_base_script.bat\"`) are **repeated across multiple paths**, suggesting **automated or scripted operations** that could be part of **payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Persistence**: The creation of batch files in multiple locations could be an attempt to **establish persistence** (e.g., via scheduled tasks or startup scripts).\n- **Command-and-Control (C2)**: The use of PowerShell for file creation and registry modification might be part of a **C2 infrastructure** or **data exfiltration**.\n- **Obfuscation**: The use of `..` in paths and non-descriptive filenames (e.g., `modulo_base_script.bat`) may be **obfuscation tactics** to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Behavior**\n- **Legitimate**: PowerShell is a common tool for administrative tasks, and .NET DLLs are standard components. The Temp directory is a valid location for temporary files.\n- **Malicious**: The **repetition of file creation**, **unusual paths**, and **absence of clear purpose** (e.g., `dir` being written to files) suggest **potential malicious intent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Temp File**:\n   - Analyze the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1` for malicious code (e.g., encoded payloads, `Invoke-WebRequest`, or `Start-Process` commands).\n   - Check if the file is signed or linked to known malicious hashes.\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **EDR solutions** to track the execution of scripts and their outputs.\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate if the created batch files are being used to execute commands across the network (e.g., via `ping`, `net use`, or `PsExec`).\n\n4. **Review Registry Changes**:\n   - Correlate the \"Registry value set\" events with other logs to determine if **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry run keys) were added.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **suspicious PowerShell activity** that could indicate **malware execution, persistence, or data exfiltration**. While not definitive proof of a threat, the **pattern of repetitive file creation, obfuscation, and DLL loading** warrants further investigation. **Confidence level: Medium** (requires additional context, such as the contents of the Temp file or network traffic analysis, to confirm malicious intent)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There's a file deletion, some file creations, image loads, and registry changes. But I need to check if these are normal or if they indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, some are in typical locations like AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for temporary files. However, the fact that PowerShell is deleting a script from there might be normal if it's just cleaning up. But then there are multiple file creations in different directories. The command lines show PowerShell scripts that are creating files and checking if certain paths exist. \n\nWait, some of the command lines have 'New-Item' and 'Set-Content' commands. That's creating files and writing content. But the paths are a bit convoluted with '..' which might be navigating directories. However, without seeing the actual content of the files, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. \n\nThere are also several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell since it uses the .NET framework. The registry events might be part of normal operations, but multiple registry value sets could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed, so that's a bit unclear.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be part of normal communication between processes, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The 'Process accessed' events are also common and not necessarily suspicious.\n\nWhat stands out is the repetitive pattern of PowerShell creating files in various locations and checking for the existence of other files. This could be part of a script that's setting up files for later use, which might be benign, but in some cases, it could be part of a larger attack, like deploying payloads or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, none of the events directly indicate a security breach. There's no mention of network activity, unauthorized access, or obvious malicious payloads. The logs are more about process and file operations, which are normal for many applications. \n\nConsidering all that, while there's some activity that could be considered unusual, it's not enough to conclusively say it's malicious. Without more context or additional logs (like network traffic or more detailed file contents), it's hard to determine if this is a genuine threat or just normal system behavior. So the batch might not be immediately suspicious, but it's worth further investigation if there are other indicators elsewhere.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs provided shows a series of **PowerShell-related activities** involving file operations, registry modifications, and .NET framework interactions. While many of these actions are **common in legitimate scenarios** (e.g., script execution, temporary file cleanup), certain patterns warrant closer scrutiny. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Activity**:\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion**: \n     - PowerShell is creating files (e.g., `New-Item`, `Set-Content`) and deleting temporary scripts (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`). While this is normal for scripts, the **repetitive creation of files in non-standard paths** (e.g., `modulo_secundario\\...`, `registro_secundario\\...`) raises questions about purpose.\n     - **Path Manipulation**: The use of `..` in file paths (e.g., `modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..\\registro_logico\\...`) suggests directory navigation, which could be benign (e.g., relative paths) or part of obfuscation techniques.\n\n   - **Existence Checks**:\n     - Scripts repeatedly check for the existence of files (e.g., `Test-Path`) across multiple paths. This could indicate **conditional logic** (e.g., checking for prerequisites) or **attempting to locate resources**, which may be part of a larger process (e.g., deployment, persistence).\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple **`Provider Lifecycle`** and **`Registry Value Set`** events are logged. While registry changes are common in legitimate software, **unusual or high-frequency modifications** (without clear context) could signal **malicious configuration changes** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, hooking).\n\n3. **.NET Framework Interactions**:\n   - **Image Load Events** point to standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). These are **expected for PowerShell** but could be leveraged by attackers to execute payloads in memory (e.g., **PowerShell Empire**, **PoshC2**).\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Potential Concern**\n- **Lack of Context**: \n  - No **command-line arguments**, **user context**, or **network activity** is provided, making it hard to determine if these actions are part of **legitimate automation** or **malicious behavior**.\n  \n- **File Path Patterns**:\n  - The use of **non-standard, obfuscated paths** (e.g., `modulo_secundario\\...`, `registro_secundario\\...`) may indicate **obfuscation** or **attempts to evade detection**.\n\n- **Repetitive Checks**:\n  - The repeated use of `Test-Path` across multiple locations could signal **resource discovery** (e.g., searching for files to exploit) or **preparation for lateral movement**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs **do not definitively indicate malicious activity**, the **combination of PowerShell scripting, file manipulation, and registry changes** warrants **further investigation**. Key next steps would include:\n- **Analyzing the actual content** of created\/deleted files (e.g., via memory dumps, file hashes).\n- **Correlating with network logs** to check for external communication.\n- **Reviewing user context** (e.g., admin privileges, user intent).\n\n**Verdict**: **Low to moderate risk** — the activity is **not immediately malicious**, but **unusual patterns** (e.g., obfuscated paths, repetitive checks) merit deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist. The commands use Test-Path and then exit with 0 or 1 based on whether the file is present. These paths look like they're in various directories, some of which seem to be part of the system, others in user-specific locations like AppData. \n\nI notice that some of the files being checked are in paths that have a pattern, like \"modulo_geral\", \"tarefa_logico\", \"componente_secundario\", etc. These might be part of a larger script or a set of scripts that are checking for the presence of specific files. But why would that be suspicious? Well, if an attacker is trying to check for the presence of a file that might be part of their payload or a staging area, that could be a red flag. However, just checking for file existence isn't necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts to create temporary files, but deleting them afterward might be an attempt to clean up. However, the file is a PowerShell script, which is normal for PowerShell operations. The Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad.\n\nThere's also a mention of winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The file creation there is part of its normal operation, so that's probably benign. The Registry value set events could indicate changes to the registry, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nNow, looking at the confidence. The majority of events are normal PowerShell operations. The Test-Path commands are common in scripts. However, the repeated use of these commands across different paths might indicate that someone is trying to check for the presence of multiple files, possibly as part of a larger attack. However, since there's no evidence of actual malicious activity like downloading files, executing payloads, or modifying system settings, it's not conclusive. \n\nThe key here is that the logs don't show any direct malicious activity. The events are all within normal operational boundaries. So while the pattern might be unusual, without more context or additional suspicious events (like network activity, process creation of unknown executables, etc.), it's not enough to flag this as a security incident. Therefore, the confidence level is low, and the batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation unless there's more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs consist of a series of PowerShell commands and system events, primarily focused on checking the existence of files in various directories. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell Usage**: \n   - Multiple entries involve PowerShell executing commands like `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files (e.g., `modulo_geral`, `tarefa_logico`, etc.). These commands exit with status codes (`0` or `1`) based on whether the target file exists.\n   - **Context**: Such checks are common in scripts for conditional logic, but the repetitive pattern across different directories might warrant further scrutiny if tied to suspicious file paths or behaviors.\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`entrada_base.exe`) is created and deleted in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. This is typical for transient scripts but could be a red flag if the file contents are malicious or if the script is part of a larger payload.\n\n3. **System and User Paths**:\n   - File paths span system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`) and user-specific locations (e.g., `AppData`). While some paths are benign, others (e.g., `registro_temporario`, `bin`) might indicate staging areas for payloads or tools.\n\n4. **Registry and Pipe Events**:\n   - Registry value modifications and pipe creation events are noted but lack context to confirm malicious intent. These are common in legitimate software but could be exploited in attacks.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Low to Moderate Suspicion**: \n  - The logs do not show direct evidence of malicious activity (e.g., unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or execution of unknown binaries).\n  - The repetitive `Test-Path` commands and temporary file operations are consistent with both benign scripts and potential reconnaissance phases in attacks. However, **no conclusive indicators of compromise (IoCs)** are present.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- **Further Investigation**: If these logs are part of a larger dataset or occur in a high-risk environment, correlate them with:\n  - Network traffic analysis (e.g., unusual outbound connections).\n  - File integrity checks (e.g., hash verification of `entrada_base.exe`).\n  - User behavior analytics (e.g., unexpected PowerShell usage patterns).\n- **Contextual Context**: Without additional data (e.g., timestamps, user identities, or file contents), the logs alone are not sufficient to trigger an investigation.\n\n### Confidence Level:\n- **Low**: The events are largely consistent with normal system operations. While the pattern of file checks is unusual, it does not confirm malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a powershell.exe process that's checking if a certain file exists. The command line is testing the path \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe\". If it exists, it exits 0, else 1. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script that's verifying dependencies or setup steps. Not immediately suspicious, but maybe part of something larger.\n\nThen there are several entries where powershell.exe is accessed, and image loads related to .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard components for .NET applications, so loading them is normal. However, there's also a mention of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That might be part of legitimate antivirus operations, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. Hmm, need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nNext, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1\". Creating and deleting temporary files is common, but if this is part of a script that's testing execution policies or something similar, maybe it's a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The fact that it's deleted afterward might be a cleanup step, which is normal.\n\nThen there are multiple \"Engine Lifecycle\" events with powershell.exe, which might relate to script execution. The command lines again check for the existence of other files in different paths. These could be part of a setup or deployment process, but again, if these files are not supposed to be there, that's a problem. However, the logs don't indicate that the files are malicious, just that their existence is being checked.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool for checking user identity. That's normal. Then a cmd.exe process that checks if a file exists in the temp directory. Again, similar to the powershell checks. These are all common system utilities being used for file existence checks.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple process creations and accesses, image loads of legitimate DLLs, temporary file creation and deletion, and checking for the existence of various files. None of the entries show obvious signs of malware, like unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or execution of suspicious scripts. However, the repeated checking of file existence in different paths might be part of a larger operation. But without more context, like the actual content of the files being checked or any errors, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. Even if it's not outright malicious, the fact that there are multiple checks for the existence of files in different directories could be part of something that's trying to probe the system. However, in many legitimate scenarios, scripts do check for the presence of files before proceeding. For example, installation scripts might check if dependencies are present.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of PowerShell and CMD for these checks. While PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be abused, the commands here are simple existence checks. There's no indication of downloading payloads, executing remote commands, or modifying system settings beyond registry value sets, which are mentioned but not detailed.\n\nThe registry value set events might be part of configuring PowerShell execution policies or other settings. But again, without knowing what's being set, it's hard to assess. However, if the logs were showing changes to critical registry keys, that would be a concern.\n\nPutting it all together: the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. They are all within the bounds of normal system operations, even if a bit repetitive. However, the fact that there are so many file existence checks in different locations might warrant further investigation, especially if this is part of a larger pattern that's not visible here. But based solely on the provided logs, it's more on the side of being a normal system activity rather than a security incident. Therefore, it might not be immediately interesting for investigation unless there's more context pointing towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of routine system operations involving PowerShell, CMD, and Windows Defender components. While the activity is not overtly malicious, it warrants cautious analysis due to the repetitive nature of file existence checks and potential for misuse. Here's a structured assessment:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **File Existence Checks:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell and CMD processes are executed to verify the presence of files in specific directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`). These checks are common in scripts for dependency validation or deployment workflows but could also be part of reconnaissance if the files are not legitimate.\n\n2. **Legitimate Component Usage:**\n   - **.NET Framework DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and **Windows Defender DLLs** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are loaded. These are standard for .NET applications and antivirus operations, respectively, and are not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **Temporary File Handling:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted, which is typical for configuration or execution policy testing. However, the presence of a script named `__PSScriptPolicyTest...` might hint at testing execution policies, which could be a benign or malicious action depending on context.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Registry value changes are logged but lack details (e.g., keys or values modified). Without further context, these could be part of legitimate configuration changes or potentially malicious persistence mechanisms.\n\n5. **Use of `whoami.exe`:**\n   - A standard tool for querying user identity, which is normal in scripts requiring authentication checks.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low Immediate Risk:** The activity aligns with typical system operations (e.g., dependency checks, script execution, antivirus operations). No direct evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation is present.\n- **Potential for Misuse:** The repetitive file checks and temporary file creation could be part of a larger operation (e.g., probing for system vulnerabilities or preparing for lateral movement). However, this is speculative without additional context (e.g., network activity, file contents, or user behavior).\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Investigate if these checks are part of a larger pattern (e.g., repeated file probing, unusual registry changes, or network communication).\n- **Monitor for Anomalies:** Track the creation and modification of files in the paths referenced (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`) for unexpected changes or malicious content.\n- **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:** Ensure that execution policies (e.g., `RemoteSigned`, `AllSigned`) are appropriately configured to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs do not indicate an active security incident but highlight activity that could be part of legitimate or potentially malicious workflows. Further investigation into the context of the file existence checks and registry modifications is recommended to rule out subtle adversarial activity. **Priority:** Low, but vigilance is advised."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but when it's repeated multiple times, especially with different tasks, it might be a red flag. There are entries for 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded' events. The 'Image loaded' events mention files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are .NET framework components. Loading those might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could indicate something.\n\nThen there's 'whoami.exe' being executed a couple of times. That's a standard command to get user info, but again, if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe it's being used to check privileges or for lateral movement.\n\nThe command lines in some entries have PowerShell scripts that check for the existence of specific files. For example, testing if certain .cs files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a setup or checking prerequisites. But why are these files mentioned? They have paths like C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\elemento_base\\src\\unidade_principal.cs. These paths don't look standard. Maybe they're part of a custom application, but the repetition and the specific structure could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events with PowerShell commands. I'm not exactly sure what that task refers to, but if it's related to some provider or service, maybe it's being manipulated.\n\nNow, considering all this: repeated PowerShell usage, checking for specific files, loading .NET components. It could be a legitimate script, but the combination might indicate an attacker trying to execute code, check for presence of files, or set up persistence. The fact that multiple different files are checked in various directories might suggest that the attacker is looking for specific resources or trying to map the system.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying system settings. It's more about process creation and file checks. But in cybersecurity, even benign activities can be part of an attack if they're out of context. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I think the answer is yes. The clustering of PowerShell activities, the specific file checks, and the loading of .NET assemblies might warrant further examination to rule out any malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents **moderate indicators of potential interest for investigation**, but further context is needed to determine malicious intent. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**  \n   - **PowerShell.exe** is executed repeatedly with commands like `Test-Path` to check for the existence of specific `.cs` files (e.g., `unidade_principal.cs`, `estrutura_geral.cs`).  \n   - **Why this matters**: While `Test-Path` is a benign command, its repeated use in non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\elemento_base\\src\\...`) may indicate an attempt to probe the file system for specific resources or to validate prerequisites for a larger operation (e.g., deploying a tool, checking for existing configurations, or mapping the environment).\n\n2. **.NET Assembly Loads**  \n   - Multiple **`Image loaded`** events reference .NET framework components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`).  \n   - **Why this matters**: These are standard .NET assemblies, but their presence could align with malicious payloads (e.g., .NET-based malware or obfuscated scripts). However, this alone is not conclusive.\n\n3. **Unusual File Paths**  \n   - The paths checked by PowerShell (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\estrutura_base\\src\\...`) are non-standard and lack recognizable patterns (e.g., no typical application directories like `C:\\Program Files` or `C:\\Users`).  \n   - **Why this matters**: Unusual paths may suggest the attacker is interacting with a custom or hidden file structure, which could be part of a staged attack or evasion technique.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events**  \n   - Some PowerShell commands are associated with the **`Provider Lifecycle`** task. This could relate to PowerShell providers (e.g., `FileSystem`, `Registry`), but the lack of clarity on the provider’s purpose may warrant further scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags:**\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**: The activity does not align with typical user behavior (e.g., no clear purpose for checking `.cs` files or loading .NET assemblies in this context).  \n- **Repetition and Specificity**: The repeated use of `Test-Path` with unique file paths and the loading of .NET assemblies may indicate an attempt to probe or execute code in a controlled manner.  \n- **Absence of Obvious Malice**: No direct evidence of malicious activity (e.g., network connections, file modifications, or privilege escalation) is present, but the combination of behaviors raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **worth investigating further**. While the activities could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., a custom application or script), the unusual file paths, repeated PowerShell usage, and .NET assembly loads are inconsistent with typical user behavior. Investigators should:  \n1. Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity).  \n2. Analyze the contents of the `.cs` files referenced by `Test-Path` (if accessible).  \n3. Check for signs of persistence (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry modifications).  \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** (medium risk), but not conclusive evidence of malicious activity."}

That's a legitimate file, so probably not an issue. Next, a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. Then, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a script in Temp might be normal, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThen there's a pipe created, but no file involved. The next few entries are about checking if certain paths exist, which might be part of a script's logic. However, looking at the command lines, they all involve checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. That script name sounds suspicious because \"Get-Keystrokes\" could be related to keylogging, which is malicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances where the script is checked in different directories, which might indicate the attacker is trying to locate or execute a keystroke logger.

The fact that the same script name is referenced multiple times across different paths raises a red flag. \n\nAdditionally, there's a whoami.exe process, which is normal, but combined with the other events, it might be part of information gathering.

But the combination of creating\/deleting scripts, checking for keystroke-related files, and multiple process accesses might indicate a larger malicious activity. \n\nI need to weigh the normal activities against the suspicious ones.

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDelete. There are several instances where PowerShell is loading .dll files from system directories like C:\\Windows\\System32 and C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the files being loaded: mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll – these are all part of the .NET Framework. That seems legitimate. However, there's also a file from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That might be normal too, but I need to check if there's any unusual activity around those.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. The fact that it's created and then immediately deleted could be a red flag. Sometimes malware creates temporary files to execute scripts and then deletes them to avoid leaving traces. But it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate script testing process. However, the presence of such a file in the Temp directory might be worth investigating.\n\nAlso, there are a few instances of PowerShell checking if a file exists (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) in different paths. The script names are similar, and the paths are a bit generic. If these scripts are not part of a known legitimate process, they could be malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The command line arguments show that the script is checking for the existence of a file and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that. That might be part of a larger process, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nOther processes like winlogbeat.exe creating a file, whoami.exe running, notepad.exe and calc.exe with registry events are mostly normal. Svchost.exe registry changes are common as well. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell might indicate that it's being monitored or accessed by other processes, which could be normal or not.\n\nPutting this all together: the main suspicious points are the temporary script file being created and deleted, and the PowerShell scripts checking for specific files. However, without additional context like the content of the scripts or other network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of those events could be part of a legitimate process, but they might also indicate something malicious. Since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, I think these points are worth looking into further. Therefore, the answer would be that it's interesting and requires further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes several activities that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious behavior is confirmed. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in **malware obfuscation** or **script execution cleanup**, though it could also be part of legitimate testing.\n   - **File Existence Checks:** PowerShell scripts repeatedly check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in non-specific paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\...`). While this could be part of a benign process (e.g., conditional execution), the script name (`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`) raises suspicion, as it may imply **credential harvesting** or **keystroke logging**.\n\n2. **DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell loads .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) from trusted system directories. These are **normal operations** for PowerShell but could be **leveraged by malware** to execute payloads in memory.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Multiple **`ProcessAccess`** and **`RegistryEvent`** entries for `powershell.exe` and other processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`) suggest **monitoring or interaction** with system processes. This could indicate **legitimate administrative tasks** or **suspicious process injection**.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - A `.yml.new` file is created by `winlogbeat.exe`, which is a **log shipper**. This is likely **normal configuration activity** but should be verified to ensure no unauthorized modifications.\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n- **Temporary Script File Lifecycle:** The creation and deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` may indicate **evasion tactics** (e.g., avoiding log persistence).\n- **Script Name Ambiguity:** `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a **highly suspicious name** for a script, as it aligns with **malware behavior** (e.g., keylogging).\n- **Repeated File Existence Checks:** The repeated checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` suggest **conditional execution logic**, which could be part of a **payload delivery mechanism**.\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation:**\n1. **Analyze Script Content:** If possible, inspect the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` and `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, network calls, credential extraction).\n2. **Check Parent Processes:** Investigate the **parent processes** of PowerShell instances to determine if they are **legitimate** (e.g., `explorer.exe`, `cmd.exe`) or **suspicious** (e.g., `svchost.exe` with unknown modules).\n3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor for **unusual outbound connections** or **data exfiltration** from the system, especially if `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is involved.\n4. **Verify Winlogbeat Configuration:** Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a **legitimate configuration update** and not tampered with.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but they contain **suspicious patterns** (e.g., temporary script lifecycle, ambiguous script names) that **require further analysis**. This batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the potential for **malware obfuscation** or **unauthorized activity**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I should check if there's anything suspicious there.\n\nThen there's a bunch of powershell.exe processes. The first one is accessing a process, but no file involved. Then there's whoami.exe being executed, which is usually just checking the user, so that's probably benign. But then there's another powershell.exe accessing a process again. \n\nChrome.exe has several network connections and DNS queries. That's common for a browser, but maybe if there's an unusual number or to unexpected domains, but the logs don't specify the destinations. \n\nThe interesting part comes later with the powershell.exe processes loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET libraries, which is normal. However, the last one is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but why is it being loaded by powershell? Typically, that's part of the Defender's operations. But maybe there's a reason to flag it if it's unexpected. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell might indicate that it's running scripts or modules that are loading these DLLs. \n\nWait, the command line for one of the PowerShell processes is \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\", which are just listing files recursively. That's a normal command, but maybe in the context of other activities. \n\nThe main thing is that there's a new file created by winlogbeat, which could be part of installation. But the rest of the events don't show any obvious malicious activity. However, the repeated access to processes and loading of DLLs might be part of something. But without more context, like unexpected network destinations or unusual commands, it's hard to say. \n\nHmm, the classification here is tricky. The presence of the new file and the PowerShell activities might be benign, but there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent. Maybe the justification is that there's no clear malicious activity, but the events are not entirely normal either. But I think the confidence should be low. However, the user wants a classification. Maybe \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear indicator of compromise. But I need to check again. \n\nWait, the first event is the creation of a .yml.new file for winlogbeat. That's part of the configuration. Then PowerShell is running commands, but nothing too suspicious. The DLLs loaded are all legitimate. So maybe it's just normal operations. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence because there's no clear malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity including legitimate processes (chrome.exe, whoami.exe), standard file operations (winlogbeat configuration), and expected DLL loading by PowerShell. No indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first two entries: there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to hide its tracks. The file name has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing malicious commands. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries with the task 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' from PowerShell. The command line shows 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These commands are used to list files recursively. While that's not inherently malicious, doing this repeatedly could be part of a reconnaissance phase where the attacker is trying to map out the file system to find sensitive information or other scripts.\n\nThen there's an entry about a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit concerning because startup scripts can be used to execute code automatically when a user logs in, which could be a way to maintain persistence.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of configuring persistence or altering system behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. The same goes for the Process accessed event, which might just be normal system activity.\n\nThere's also a mention of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, but if it's creating files in unusual locations or with unexpected names, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, the file path seems to be part of a typical installation directory, so maybe it's just normal operation.\n\nThe image loaded event points to a Defender DLL. That's probably a legitimate process, so not a concern here.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in Temp, repeated recursive file listings, and potential registry changes. These could indicate an attacker probing the system. However, some of these activities could also be part of normal operations or benign scripts. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough suspicious patterns to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, recursive directory enumeration commands, and potential registry modifications. These patterns may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts by an attacker.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
