{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by scanning through the entries.\n\nFirst, there are several events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a command-line utility that displays the current user's identity. That's usually benign, but sometimes attackers use it to check privileges. However, just one instance might not be a big deal.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. Let me check the specific events. There's a process access event, registry value set, and image loaded events. The image loaded paths include some .NET DLLs and a Windows Defender DLL. Loading .NET DLLs could be part of normal PowerShell operations, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a red flag if it's being used in an unexpected way.\n\nWait, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That's interesting. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of a script execution, which might be benign if it's part of a legitimate process. However, if the script was malicious, this would be a way to execute it without leaving traces. But the name suggests it's a test script, maybe related to PowerShell execution policy checks. However, the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be suspicious, especially if there's no clear reason for it.\n\nLooking at the command line arguments for some PowerShell processes, they're running commands like ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, etc. These are standard commands for listing files recursively. But if this is part of a larger malicious activity, like searching for sensitive files, that could be a problem. However, on its own, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother point is the multiple image load events for PowerShell. Loading various DLLs is normal, but if there are any unexpected or uncommon DLLs, that could be a sign. The ones listed here seem to be part of the .NET framework and Windows Defender, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, which is normal but could be used by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the temporary script file created and deleted, and the multiple PowerShell activities. However, the presence of a test script might be a false positive. But given that PowerShell is often used in attacks and the script's temporary nature, this could indicate an attempt to execute a script without leaving evidence. However, without more context or other suspicious activities (like network connections to bad IPs, unusual registry changes, etc.), it's hard to be certain. The activity might be part of a legitimate process, like a script test. But since the user is asking for investigation, this batch does have some red flags that warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **Chrome.exe DNS Queries and Network Connections**: \n   - Routine for a browser; no immediate concern.\n\n2. **Whoami.exe Execution**:\n   - A standard utility for checking user identity; benign unless part of a larger attack chain.\n\n3. **.NET and Windows Defender DLLs Loaded**:\n   - Common in PowerShell operations; not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Temporary Script File Created and Deleted**:\n   - **File Path**: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1`\n   - **Behavior**: A script is created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted. While this could be a legitimate test (e.g., checking PowerShell execution policies), it also aligns with tactics used by malware to execute scripts without leaving persistent traces.\n\n2. **PowerShell Command-Line Activity**:\n   - **Commands**: `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, `ngci -recurse`\n   - **Context**: These commands recursively list files and directories. While normal, they could be part of a broader effort to search for sensitive data (e.g., credentials, configuration files) or prepare for lateral movement.\n\n3. **Pipe Created Event**:\n   - May indicate inter-process communication, which is common but could be exploited by malware for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concerns**\n- **Lack of Context**: The logs do not include timestamps, user context, or network activity (e.g., connections to external IPs), making it difficult to determine if the PowerShell activity is benign or malicious.\n- **Script Test Naming**: The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` suggests a potential attempt to bypass PowerShell execution policies, which is a common technique in attacks.\n- **Script Deletion**: The immediate deletion of the script file may indicate an attempt to avoid detection, though this could also be part of a legitimate process (e.g., automated testing).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for network traffic, registry changes, or user behavior (e.g., privilege escalation) around the time of the script creation\/deletion.\n   - Investigate the source of the PowerShell commands (e.g., user-initiated vs. automated).\n\n2. **Analyze the Script Content**:\n   - If the script file can be recovered (e.g., from disk forensics), analyze its contents for malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Implement logging and monitoring for PowerShell activity, especially script execution and use of `Invoke-Expression` or similar commands.\n\n4. **Check for Execution Policy Bypass**:\n   - Verify if the system’s PowerShell execution policy was temporarily relaxed (e.g., `Bypass` mode) to allow the script to run.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the events include legitimate system activity, the **creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script** and **intensive PowerShell operations** warrant further investigation. These could indicate either a benign test or the early stages of a malicious attack. **Further analysis with contextual data (e.g., network logs, user activity, script content)** is critical to determine the nature of the activity. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**—the logs contain potential indicators of suspicious behavior that require deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry one by one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. Wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... MpClient.dll. That's a legitimate Windows Defender file. So maybe that's normal. But I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the same file is mentioned multiple times. Maybe that's part of its setup.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command line that's doing ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. That's just listing files recursively, which might be benign. But sometimes attackers use similar commands to find files. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother PowerShell creating a file named objeto_principal.txt. That's a Spanish term for \"main object,\" which is vague. Could be a normal file, but the name doesn't stand out.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events for PowerShell, conhost, svchost, etc. Registry changes can be normal, but if there are many, it might indicate something. However, svchost and services.exe are legitimate processes. The User Account Management events are also common, maybe during logon.\n\nThe same winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file multiple times. That might be part of its operation, like writing a configuration. But if it's doing that repeatedly, maybe there's an issue. However, the file path seems legitimate.\n\nLooking for any signs of malicious activity: The first event's DLL is from Windows Defender, which is good. The PowerShell commands are basic. The file creations are in user directories, which can be normal. The registry events don't have specific keys mentioned, so it's hard to tell. The multiple events from svchost and others might be normal system behavior.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same file being created by winlogbeat multiple times might be a red flag. Maybe it's trying to overwrite or create a config file multiple times. But without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the presence of multiple registry events could be part of a larger attack, but again, not enough info.\n\nOverall, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. They seem to be a mix of normal system processes and legitimate software operations. The confidence is low, but since there's no obvious malicious behavior, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the repeated file creation is suspicious. However, without more context, it's safer to classify as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system operations (e.g., Windows Defender DLL loading, PowerShell file listing, winlogbeat configuration file creation) and common process\/registry activity. No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting. First, looking at the first event: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but urlmon.dll is part of the Windows system, so that might be normal. However, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But in this case, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location. So maybe that's just a normal system process.\n\nThen there are two events with svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services. Setting registry values could be normal, but if done in a suspicious way, like modifying keys related to startup or services, it might be a red flag. However, the events don't specify which registry keys are being modified. Without more details, it's hard to tell, but the fact that it's happening twice might be worth noting.\n\nThe third event is another Calculator.exe loading the same urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard Windows process. The correct name is calc.exe. This might be a typo or a renamed malicious executable. If Calculator.exe is loading a legitimate DLL, but the process name is misspelled, that could indicate a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one. That's a potential indicator of compromise.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of Calculator.exe (which is suspicious) loading a legitimate DLL, and svchost.exe modifying registry values. However, without more context, like the registry keys being changed or other anomalous behavior, it's not conclusive. The confidence might be moderate. The justification would be the unusual process name and the repeated registry changes, but since the DLL path is legitimate, it's not a strong indicator. Maybe \"INTERESTING\" but with medium confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Presence of Calculator.exe (likely a typo\/malicious process) loading urlmon.dll, combined with svchost.exe modifying registry values. While some events involve legitimate system components, the combination of non-standard process names and registry activity raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
