{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious here. But then I see several entries related to powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities.\n\nOne of the entries has a command_line field with a PowerShell script that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub URL. The URLs mentioned are all from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is a common place for hosting text files, including LICENSE.txt. But the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files multiple times might be a red flag. However, the files being downloaded are LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign. But wait, the user might be using these downloads as part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs, which is normal. But the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could indicate that the process is loading additional components, possibly for executing malicious code. Also, there's a FileCreate and then FileDelete event for a temporary PowerShell script. That's interesting because creating and then deleting a file might be an attempt to hide the presence of a script, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub. While downloading a LICENSE.txt file isn't inherently malicious, if this is part of a larger pattern—like downloading executable files or other payloads—it could be a sign of something malicious. However, in this case, all the files mentioned are LICENSE.txt, which are usually just text files. But the fact that it's happening multiple times with different repositories might be suspicious. Maybe the attacker is testing or setting up multiple points of access.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry events and process accesses might indicate that the attacker is trying to modify system settings or gain persistence. But looking at the specific events, the registry value set is mentioned, but without more details on what's being set, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the file operations and the PowerShell activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes downloading files, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files. While some of these actions are normal, the combination and the frequency might indicate that something is amiss. Especially since the user is using PowerShell in a way that's not typical for regular user activities. However, the lack of obvious malicious files (like .exe or .dll downloads) might lower the confidence a bit.\n\nSo, the justification here would be that there's a pattern of PowerShell being used to download files from GitHub, along with file creation and deletion, and multiple image loads. Even though the files are LICENSE.txt, the repeated actions and the use of PowerShell for these tasks could be indicative of a potential security threat. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the following patterns and potential red flags:\n\n### Key Indicators:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Usage for File Downloads**:\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes use `System.Net.WebClient.DownloadFile` to fetch `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`). While downloading text files is normal, **repetition across different repositories** and the use of temporary file paths (`$env:TEMP\\...`) may indicate **suspicious activity**, such as testing or obfuscating payloads.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This behavior is often seen in **malware or scripts designed to avoid detection** by minimizing forensic traces.\n\n3. **Image Load Events**:\n   - PowerShell loads several .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.dll`, `System.Core.dll`). While legitimate, **excessive or unusual loading of DLLs** could suggest **code injection** or **malicious module execution**.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Activity**:\n   - Registry modifications and process access events (e.g., `Provider Lifecycle`) may indicate **attempts to modify system settings** or **establish persistence**.\n\n### Contextual Considerations:\n- **Benign vs. Malicious**: Downloading `LICENSE.txt` files is not inherently malicious, but **repetition, obfuscation, and lack of clear purpose** (e.g., no user interaction or visible utility) raises concerns.\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**: PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but **unusual patterns** (e.g., repeated downloads, file deletion) may signal **malicious intent**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no direct evidence of malware is present, the **combination of repetitive PowerShell activity, temporary file manipulation, and lack of clear justification** warrants further investigation. This could include:\n- Analyzing the GitHub repositories for malicious content.\n- Checking for additional hidden processes or network traffic.\n- Reviewing system logs for signs of persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **Moderate** (interesting but not definitively malicious without additional context)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all the events together and determine if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are several entries involving PowerShell.exe with command lines that use WebClient to download files from GitHub. The URLs are all pointing to LICENSE.txt files in different repositories. That seems a bit odd because normally, LICENSE.txt is a benign file, but the fact that they're being downloaded via PowerShell might be a red flag. Especially since the paths where the files are saved are in temporary directories, which is common in malicious activities to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where chrome.exe is modifying the registry. While Chrome might legitimately modify the registry for updates or settings, having so many repeated entries (like 8 instances of \"Registry value set\") could indicate something automated or malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating configuration files, that might be normal if it's part of a monitoring setup. However, if it's being used in an unexpected way, it could be a concern. But the file paths here seem to be standard installation directories, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThere's also a network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. That might just be normal antivirus activity, but I'll note it as a possible benign event.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell commands again, they all use the same structure: DownloadFile from a GitHub URL to a temporary location. While the files are LICENSE.txt, which are typically safe, the use of PowerShell for downloading could be part of a more complex attack. For example, maybe the real malicious payload is being executed after downloading, but in the given events, only the download is visible. However, the fact that there are multiple such downloads might suggest that the system is being used to fetch multiple files, possibly as part of a larger attack.\n\nThe other events, like file creation and registry changes, don't seem to be directly related to the PowerShell downloads. The repetition of registry events for chrome.exe might be normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it's worth looking into.\n\nConsidering all this, the main suspicious points are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub to temporary directories. Even though the files are named LICENSE.txt, the method of downloading them via PowerShell could be a sign of a malicious actor. However, since the files are from public repositories, it's possible they are legitimate. But the combination of multiple such events and other registry changes might indicate something more. The confidence isn't 100% because without seeing the actual content of the downloaded files or more suspicious activities, it's hard to be certain. However, the presence of these downloads alone is enough to flag the events as potentially interesting.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious PowerShell activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Downloads from GitHub**:\n   - **Multiple events** show `powershell.exe` using `System.Net.WebClient` to download `LICENSE.txt` files from **public GitHub repositories** (e.g., `https:\/\/github.com\/...\/raw\/...\/LICENSE.txt`). \n   - While `LICENSE.txt` files are typically benign, the **use of PowerShell for downloading** such files is unusual and could indicate:\n     - **Command-line obfuscation** (e.g., using `WebClient` instead of `Invoke-WebRequest`).\n     - **Initial access or data exfiltration** (e.g., downloading malicious payloads disguised as benign files).\n   - **Destination paths** are temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\...`), which is common in stealthy attacks to avoid detection.\n\n2. **Repetitive Registry Modifications**:\n   - **8 instances** of `chrome.exe` modifying the registry (e.g., `Registry value set`). While Chrome may legitimately update its settings, **repetition** could indicate **malicious automation** (e.g., persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering).\n\n3. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates `.yml.new` files in the `data` directory. While Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper, this could be **normal behavior during configuration updates**. However, the **repetition** of this event might suggest **unauthorized configuration changes** or **misuse of the tool**.\n\n4. **Network Activity by Defender**:\n   - `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` has a **network connection**. This is likely **benign** (e.g., Windows Defender updates or scanning), but it could also be **triggered by malicious activity** (e.g., detecting an attack).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Interesting (Likely Malicious)**: The **PowerShell downloads** from GitHub to temporary locations are **highly suspicious** and could be part of a **malicious payload delivery chain** (e.g., downloading a staged payload or exfiltrating data). \n- **Context Needed**: The benign nature of `LICENSE.txt` files and the lack of further malicious activity (e.g., execution of downloaded files, lateral movement) means this is **not definitive proof of compromise**, but **further investigation** (e.g., analyzing the downloaded files, checking for unusual processes) is **recommended**.\n\n### **Confidence Level**:\n- **High Suspicion (70-80%)**: The PowerShell activity is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior, even if the immediate context is unclear."}

First, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's calc.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and reg.exe. Some of these are common system processes, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are often used in attacks. \n\nThe first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by calc.exe, that might be unusual. However, I should check if there are other signs. \n\nThen there are multiple instances of svchost.exe with registry value set events. svchost.exe is a normal process, but if it's modifying the registry, especially if it's part of a pattern, that could be concerning. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\" with \/F, which forces deletion. That might be part of a cleanup after creating a malicious task. Then, another cmd.exe command uses REG DELETE to remove entries from the Run key in the registry. Deleting registry entries could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. \n\nAlso, there's a schtasks.exe process that deletes the same \"spawn\" task. Scheduled tasks being deleted might indicate someone trying to remove traces of their activities. \n\nThe presence of multiple registry modifications, especially deletions, and the use of cmd.exe and reg.exe to manipulate the registry could be signs of an attacker trying to remove evidence. Additionally, the repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe might indicate that it's being used to execute commands or scripts. \n\nThe combination of these events—modifying the registry, deleting tasks, and using command-line tools—suggests possible malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the pattern of registry deletions and task removals is suspicious. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these could be normal system activities. For example, svchost.exe managing registry values might be part of routine operations. But the frequency and the specific commands like deleting registry keys and scheduled tasks point towards an investigation being necessary. \n\nSo, the classification here is probably \"INTERESTING\" because the activities indicate potential tampering and cleanup efforts, which are red flags in cybersecurity.

Let me check the tasks. There's a lot of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be normal, but I should check for any anomalies.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of a script trying to execute something temporarily. Also, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll.

Then there's 'powershell.exe' being accessed and some registry changes. Then 'cmd.exe' is created with a command line that has a slash, which might be part of a command. There are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed and registry values set. \n\nWait, the 'cmd.exe' entries have 'Registry value set' events.

That's normal, maybe a user changing some settings. Then there's powershell.exe doing various tasks like Pipe Created, Registry value set, Process accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be a vector for attacks. But just seeing these events alone might not be enough.\n\nLooking further, there's chrome.exe with multiple registry value sets. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that's a bit odd. But maybe it's just a normal operation, or maybe something's wrong.

That could be part of a script running, but maybe not malicious.\n\nNext, there are several entries where powershell is running commands to remove various .zip and .txt files from the Temp folder. The command lines use 'Remove-Item' with ErrorAction Ignore, which might be trying to clean up after something. But why so many different files? Could be a script that's generating temporary files and then removing them. But is that suspicious?\n\nThen there's a 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. The chrome.exe events involve loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll again, which are legitimate system files.

The repeated removal of files from Temp might be part of a script that's trying to hide its tracks. But the same process is also creating and deleting files.

MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, but if it's being loaded by powershell in an unusual way, that might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the 'Process accessed' events for powershell might indicate that another process is interacting with it, which could be a sign of something malicious.

The user is seeing a lot of PowerShell activities, including creating and deleting files in the TEMP directory. The command lines are using Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. That could be an attempt to clean up files after some operation, which might be part of a malicious script trying to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAlso, there's a file created and then immediately deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1. That might indicate that a script was executed and then deleted to cover its tracks. The multiple removal of different files (unidade_base.txt, registro_auxiliar.txt, etc.) suggests that the attacker is trying to remove multiple temporary files, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be related to log collection, but not necessarily malicious. However, combined with the PowerShell activities, it's worth noting.\n\nAnother point is the use of the \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the winlog. Those might be part of the logging system, but the PowerShell commands are being executed in a way that's repetitive and seems to be part of a larger pattern. The combination of creating and deleting files, along with loading various DLLs, could be indicative of a script that's trying to perform actions without leaving evidence.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any known benign activities that match this. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks. But the repeated deletion of multiple files in the TEMP directory, especially with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, might be a sign of something trying to avoid detection. Also, the presence of multiple Image Load events for different DLLs might be normal, but if they're from unexpected locations, that could be a problem.\n\nWait, looking at the DLLs loaded, like MpClient.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender.

Also, the use of whoami.exe is a standard command to check user context, which could be part of a script checking privileges.\n\nPutting this all together, the suspicious elements are the multiple deletions of temporary files with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, the creation and deletion of scripts, and the repetitive nature of the commands. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the pattern here might be indicative of an attacker trying to clean up after executing a script, which is a common behavior in malware.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs does show activities that are worth investigating further. It's not definitively malicious, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of activity that warrants further investigation due to potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) commonly associated with malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repetitive File Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Remove-Item` with parameters like `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` to delete files in the `%TEMP%` directory (e.g., `unidade_base.txt`, `registro_auxiliar.txt`, `pacote_ativo.txt`). This is often used to **erase evidence** of temporary files created during malicious operations (e.g., script execution, payload delivery).\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`) is created and then deleted, suggesting **ephemeral execution** of a script to avoid leaving persistent traces. This is a common tactic in malware to evade detection.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Frequent use of `ProcessAccess`, `Registry value set`, and `ImageLoad` events involving PowerShell and system DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `.NET Framework`). While PowerShell is legitimate, the **volume and repetition** of these actions may indicate automated or malicious scripting.\n\n4. **Lateral Movement or Privilege Checks**:\n   - The presence of `whoami.exe` (used to check user context) could indicate **privilege escalation attempts** or reconnaissance.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - A `.yml.new` file is created by `winlogbeat.exe`, which might be related to **log configuration changes**. While benign in isolation, this could be part of a broader effort to manipulate logging or exfiltrate data.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Context**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:\n  - PowerShell is widely used for administrative tasks, and temporary file cleanup is common in scripts.\n  - Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper, and its file creation could be part of normal operations.\n\n- **Red Flags**:\n  - The **lack of clear purpose** for the deleted files (e.g., no obvious administrative task).\n  - **No corresponding logs** of the scripts being executed (e.g., no `Start-Process` or `Invoke-Expression` commands).\n  - **Unusual lifecycle events** (e.g., `Engine Lifecycle` and `Provider Lifecycle` tasks) paired with PowerShell activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for additional PowerShell script execution (e.g., `Invoke-Expression`, `IEX`, or `Start-Process`) or network activity (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - If the deleted files (`objeto_padrao.txt`, `pacote_ativo.txt`, etc.) can be recovered, examine their contents for malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Monitor User Behavior**:\n   - Investigate the user account executing these commands (e.g., permissions, recent activity, and whether they are a legitimate admin).\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Look for registry changes, scheduled tasks, or service creation that might indicate **persistent access**.\n\n5. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Use endpoint detection tools (e.g., antivirus, EDR) to scan for indicators of known malware or anomalous behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not definitively prove malicious intent, the **pattern of ephemeral file creation\/deletion** and **repetitive PowerShell activity** raises concerns. This warrants **further investigation** to rule out adversarial activity. If this behavior is part of a larger attack chain (e.g., initial access, lateral movement, data exfiltration), it could represent a **security incident**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries are about chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, there are multiple instances of these events. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, so maybe that's a red flag. But I need to check more.\n\nThen there are several entries involving powershell.exe with \"Process accessed\" events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's something to note. But again, it's common for legitimate scripts too. However, the repetition might indicate something.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being created. Whoami.exe is a standard Windows tool that displays user information. But if it's being executed repeatedly, maybe it's part of a larger process, like checking privileges or part of a malicious script. But again, not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nNow, the last two entries are about file creation. One is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration update. The other is powershell.exe creating a \"pacote_ativo.txt\" file. The presence of a .txt file created by PowerShell could be benign, but maybe it's used to store data or as part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry changes by chrome and RuntimeBroker, which is unusual. Frequent PowerShell and whoami executions could indicate automated tasks or possible scripting for malicious purposes. The file creations might be part of normal operations, but combined with the other events, there's a pattern that could suggest either a benign process or something more malicious. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or network activity, it's a bit hard to say. But the repetition of certain events and the combination of processes might be worth investigating further. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, combined with frequent PowerShell activity and file creation events, suggest potential malicious behavior or system compromise.
