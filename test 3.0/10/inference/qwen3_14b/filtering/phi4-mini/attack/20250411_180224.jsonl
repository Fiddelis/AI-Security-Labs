{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called cmd.exe with a command line that includes schtasks creating a scheduled task. The command line has \"powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the file path here is NonExistingScript.ps1. That's a red flag because the script doesn't exist. Usually, attackers might try to run non-existent scripts to avoid detection, or maybe they're using a typo. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a high-privilege account. That's suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe being used again with a similar command, but this time the file path is \"c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the same pattern of a non-existent script. Creating scheduled tasks with these commands could be an attempt to persist access on the system.\n\nThen there's an event where svchost.exe is involved with registry value sets. While svchost is a normal process, multiple registry changes could indicate something trying to modify system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the scheduled tasks, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. The winlogbeat files might be related to log collection, but the user is downloading files like estrutura_geral.txt and entrada_ativo.txt. These could be benign, but if they're part of data exfiltration, that's a problem. However, the logs don't show data being sent out, just files being created.\n\nThe key points here are the scheduled tasks with non-existent PowerShell scripts. That's a strong indicator of malicious activity because it suggests an attempt to execute code that isn't present, which could be a sign of a failed attack or a trick to avoid detection. The use of the system account for the task adds to the suspicion, as it's a high-privilege account that attackers often target for persistence.\n\nI also notice that the same task name \"win32times\" is mentioned in multiple events. Repeated creation of the same task might be an attempt to overwrite or re-create it, which is unusual. The combination of these factors—non-existent scripts, scheduled tasks under system, and multiple process creations—points towards a potential security incident.\n\nHowever, there are some normal activities too, like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which are legitimate. But the presence of the suspicious events outweighs the normal ones. The confidence level should be high, but not 100% certain because without seeing the actual content of the scripts (which don't exist), it's possible that this is a false positive or a misconfiguration. Still, the indicators are strong enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with non-existent PowerShell scripts (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1), execution under system account, and repeated process creation attempts. These patterns are commonly associated with persistence mechanisms in malware campaigns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
