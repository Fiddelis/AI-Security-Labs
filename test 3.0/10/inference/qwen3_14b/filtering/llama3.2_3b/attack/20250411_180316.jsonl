The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: RuntimeBroker.exe and Registry value set. That's a normal process, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe with Process accessed. PowerShell is common, but frequent access might be a red flag. Next, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, so maybe that's okay. But then there's another entry for Calculator.exe loading the same dll. Hmm, maybe that's just a normal process, but I should check if there are any anomalies.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is normal. But then there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete a process. That could be suspicious if it's deleting a legitimate process, but notepad.exe is a standard app. However, the command line has some odd syntax with \\\/c and redirection. Then there's a cmd.exe command copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. Wait, sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys executable. Replacing it with a backup could be a sign of a malicious replacement, like a backdoor. That's definitely suspicious.\n\nAnother entry is schtasks.exe with taskschd.dll, which is normal. But there's a command to delete a scheduled task named win32times. Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack. Also, multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry changes. PowerShell is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities. The repeated use of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent rules could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe with an incomplete command line, which might be an attempt to execute something that was cut off. The multiple instances of registry value sets and process accesses could be part of a broader attack pattern. The combination of replacing system files, using PowerShell and cmd for suspicious commands, and modifying registry values points towards potential malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the replacement of sethc.exe, the use of wmic and schtasks for deletion, and multiple registry and process access events by PowerShell and cmd are all indicators of possible malicious behavior.

The registry events might be normal, but when combined with other activities, they could indicate something malicious. \n\nLooking at the file events, there are several image loads from system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. Those are legitimate, but sometimes attackers use these to execute malicious code. However, there's also a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1.

There are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to system files like mscoreei.dll and mscorie.dll. Those are legitimate .NET components, so maybe not a problem. However, there are also events where PowerShell is creating files in temporary directories, like the one in AppData\\Local\\Temp. Creating files there isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with other actions, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that create new items and set content in various paths. The command lines involve using New-Item and Set-Content with paths that have strange patterns, like ..\\.. which might be trying to navigate up directories. Also, the filenames have \"_script.bat\" which could be indicative of script files being created, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother thing is that there's a file deletion event for a temporary script file. That might be an attempt to clean up after executing something, which is suspicious. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created across different directories with similar naming patterns could suggest automated or batch processing, which might be part of an attack.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any clear evidence of malicious activity. The presence of Windows Defender's MpClient.dll being loaded is normal. The registry events for Chrome and PowerShell might be benign, but without more context, it's hard to say. The key points here are the repeated creation of scripts in temporary and user-specific directories, possibly trying to execute or hide malicious code.\n\nConsidering all this, the combination of creating multiple script files in non-standard locations, using PowerShell for file operations, and the deletion of a temporary file after creation might indicate an attempt to execute or hide malicious activity. However, without more context like unusual network activity or unexpected processes, it's a bit ambiguous. But the pattern is enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Script Creation in Temp\/Non-Standard Paths**  \n   - Multiple events involve PowerShell executing commands to create files (e.g., `New-Item`, `Set-Content`) in paths like:  \n     - `C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\componente_geral\\elemento_ativo_script.bat`  \n     - `C:\\entrada_comum\\modulo_secundario\\..\\estrutura_padrao\\registro_secundario_script.bat`  \n   - These paths use `..\\` (parent directory navigation), which may indicate an attempt to obfuscate or hide script locations.\n\n2. **File Deletion of Temporary Script**  \n   - A temporary script file (`AppData\\Local\\Temp\\..._script.bat`) is created and **immediately deleted**. This behavior is often seen in malware to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Abnormal Volume of Script-Related Activity**  \n   - Over **15 PowerShell events** involve creating or modifying `.bat` files across non-standard directories. While PowerShell is legitimate, the **scale and pattern** (e.g., repetitive `New-Item`\/`Set-Content` commands) suggest potential misuse for persistence or execution.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose**  \n   - The scripts created (e.g., `elemento_ativo_script.bat`) contain simple commands like `dir`, which could be benign, but the **frequency and distribution** across directories raise concerns about automated or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The creation of scripts in temporary\/user directories could be an attempt to establish persistence (e.g., autorun via `Startup` folders or scheduled tasks).\n- **Obfuscation**: The use of `..\\` in paths may be an attempt to evade detection by making file locations less obvious.\n- **Lateral Movement**: If these scripts are linked to network activity (not shown here), they could indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Network Logs**: Check for unusual outbound connections or data transfers around the time of these events.\n- **Inspect File Contents**: Analyze the contents of the created `.bat` files (even if deleted) to determine if they contain malicious payloads.\n- **Check for Scheduled Tasks or Registry Modifications**: Look for signs of persistence mechanisms (e.g., `Task Scheduler`, `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n- **Monitor User Behavior**: Determine if the account executing these commands is a legitimate user or if there’s a compromise (e.g., credential theft).\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict:**\n**Interesting for Investigation** – The pattern of PowerShell-driven script creation, file deletion, and obfuscated paths is highly suggestive of potential malicious activity. Further analysis is required to confirm if this is a false positive or part of an attack."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for patterns or suspicious activities across all the events.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve PowerShell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. There are several instances where PowerShell is used to create new items and set content in files. For example, commands like New-Item and Set-Content with paths that have \"..\\\" which might be trying to navigate directories. But wait, the paths here seem a bit odd. They have parts like \"C:\\\\elemento_secundario\\\\elemento_secundario\\\\..\\\\entrada_base\\\\...\" which might be trying to access parent directories. However, I should check if these are legitimate or if they're trying to obfuscate the actual path.\n\nThen, looking at the file creation events. There are entries where files like \"componente_comum_script.bat\" are created with the content \"dir\". That's a simple directory listing command. But creating multiple batch files with such commands might be part of a larger script or could be benign. However, the repetition of similar commands across different paths might indicate an automated process or possibly a script that's being deployed.\n\nAnother point is the use of Test-Path in several commands. The scripts check if a file exists and exit with 0 or 1. This could be part of a legitimate check, but when combined with the creation of multiple files in different directories, it might be part of a larger attack, like establishing persistence or preparing for further actions.\n\nI also notice some events related to Windows Defender, like MpClient.dll and MpOAV.dll being loaded. That's normal, but if there's an attempt to delete temporary files (like the __PSScriptPolicyTest files), it could be an indicator of someone trying to clean up after running scripts, which is suspicious.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of a legitimate script that's creating temporary files and checking their existence. The use of PowerShell is common in both legitimate and malicious contexts. The key is whether there's a pattern that deviates from normal behavior. Since the logs don't show any obvious signs of exploitation, malware, or unauthorized access, but the repetitive nature of the file creation and path manipulation might warrant further investigation.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation. Even if it's not overtly malicious, the repeated creation of files with similar names and the use of parent directory navigation could be something worth looking into. It's not a clear-cut attack, but it's not entirely benign either. So, I think this batch of events is interesting enough to warrant further analysis to determine if there's an underlying issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **moderate suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Multiple `New-Item` and `Set-Content` commands create `.bat` files (e.g., `componente_comum_script.bat`) with the content `dir` (directory listing). While benign in isolation, the **repetition across different paths** suggests a potential automated process or obfuscation tactic.\n\n2. **Path Manipulation**:\n   - Paths like `C:\\elemento_secundario\\elemento_secundario\\..\\entrada_base\\...` use `..` to navigate parent directories. This could be **obfuscation** to hide the true target path or a **legitimate** directory structure if the paths resolve to valid locations. However, the lack of clear context raises questions.\n\n3. **File Existence Checks**:\n   - Scripts use `Test-Path` to check for files (e.g., `pacote_temporario_script.bat`) and exit with status codes. This is common in scripts but could indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **precondition checks** for further actions.\n\n4. **Cleanup Activity**:\n   - A `File Delete logged` event deletes a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1`). This may indicate **post-execution cleanup** (common in malicious scripts) or normal script execution, but the lack of context makes it ambiguous.\n\n5. **Windows Defender Module Loads**:\n   - Events involving `MpClient.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) are normal. However, if these modules are involved in **unusual interactions** (not observed here), they could signal evasion techniques.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**\n- The **repetitive nature** of the file creation and path manipulation could indicate **script-based automation**, **exploitation**, or **persistence attempts**.\n- While no direct malicious activity (e.g., exfiltration, payload execution) is observed, the **lack of clear purpose** for the `.bat` files and the **consistent use of PowerShell** for file operations may suggest **suspicious behavior** warranting deeper analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for additional events (e.g., network traffic, process creation) that might link these file operations to external activity or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Inspect the deleted temporary scripts (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) if available to determine their purpose.\n\n3. **Monitor for Persistence**:\n   - Investigate if the created `.bat` files are being used for **scheduled tasks**, **registry modifications**, or **service creation**.\n\n4. **Check User Context**:\n   - Determine which user account executed these scripts. Administrative privileges or lack of user context could indicate compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events are **not overtly malicious** but exhibit **patterns consistent with script-based activity** that could be benign or part of a larger attack. **Further investigation is recommended** to rule out threats like **script-based persistence**, **data exfiltration**, or **preparation for lateral movement**."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the commands. Some entries have command lines that check for the existence of certain files, like \"if (Test-Path ...)\" and then exit 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's checking if a file exists, which could be benign, but maybe part of a larger attack.\n\nWait, there's a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. That path is a known location where PowerShell profiles are stored. If a malicious script is being saved there, it could execute automatically when PowerShell starts. But the event just says 'File created' without more context. However, the same file is mentioned twice in the logs, which might indicate some repeated activity.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET framework DLLs like clr.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are normal for PowerShell, so not necessarily bad. But the Defender DLL is also loaded, which might be part of the system's own processes.\n\nOther processes like 'whoami.exe' and 'cmd.exe' are standard utilities. The 'whoami' commands are just checking the user, which is normal. The cmd.exe command is checking if a file exists in the temp directory, which could be part of a legitimate script or maybe a malicious one trying to see if a payload is present.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes creating files, checking for files, and accessing processes. The repetition of certain commands and the creation of a file in the PowerShell startup directory might be suspicious. However, without more context like unexpected network activity, elevation of privileges, or execution of malicious code, it's hard to be certain. The events don't show any clear signs of malware execution or data exfiltration. It could be a legitimate script that's just checking for files, but the combination of multiple PowerShell events and file operations might warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, I think this is interesting enough to flag for further analysis. The system administrator might want to check the contents of the created files and review the PowerShell scripts for any malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of **PowerShell activity** and **file operations** that could warrant further investigation, though no explicit malicious behavior is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple entries show **PowerShell processes** creating files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) and checking for the existence of files via commands like `Test-Path`. While benign in isolation, such behavior could be part of a script probing for system conditions or attempting to persist (e.g., modifying startup profiles).\n\n2. **File Creation in Sensitive Locations**:\n   - A file is created at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`. This directory is associated with **PowerShell profile scripts**, which execute automatically upon startup. If this file contains malicious code, it could enable persistence or command execution without user interaction.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Malicious Indicators**:\n   - **Legitimate tools** like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are used for basic system checks (e.g., `whoami` to retrieve user context, `cmd` to check file existence). These are common in both benign and malicious scenarios.\n   - **Defender DLLs** (e.g., `MpClient.dll`) are loaded, which is normal system behavior.\n\n4. **Absence of Red Flags**:\n   - No evidence of **network activity**, **privilege escalation**, **data exfiltration**, or **unusual process execution** is present in the logs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs show **normal PowerShell usage** with some repetitive file operations, but the **creation of a PowerShell startup profile file** and the **frequency of PowerShell activity** could indicate **potential persistence mechanisms** or **script-based reconnaissance**. While not definitively malicious, this warrants further investigation, such as:\n- Inspecting the contents of the created files.\n- Monitoring for additional suspicious PowerShell commands or network traffic.\n- Checking for unauthorized changes to system configurations.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell activity and file operations in sensitive locations, but no conclusive evidence of malicious behavior."}

The user is asking me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. That's typical, not suspicious. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used in certain ways, it can be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a pattern. Each PowerShell command is using Test-Path to check if a specific file exists. The paths mentioned are all in different directories, like C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\... and others. The scripts are exiting with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. This seems like checking for the presence of certain files, maybe part of a setup or installation process. However, the repetition of these checks might be unusual. \n\nThen there are events related to image loading, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. That's normal for PowerShell. But then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's interesting because it might indicate interaction with antivirus software, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nThere's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. Creating and deleting a temporary file could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do this to hide their activities. However, the fact that it's named with a PSScriptPolicyTest might suggest it's related to PowerShell execution policy testing, which could be legitimate. \n\nAnother event is a Pipe Created, which might be part of inter-process communication. Not suspicious on its own. \n\nLooking at all the events together, the main thing is the repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific files. The paths mentioned don't look like standard system files, but they could be part of an application's structure. However, the lack of other suspicious activities like network connections, unauthorized access, or execution of malicious payloads makes me think this might be benign. \n\nBut wait, the fact that there are multiple Test-Path checks could be part of a script that's verifying dependencies or setup steps. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs might indicate that the system is actively monitoring, which is good. \n\nI should also check if there's any indication of elevation of privileges, but I don't see any events related to that. The user is fiddelis, which might be a legitimate user. \n\nConsidering all that, the events don't show clear signs of a security incident. The PowerShell activities are common, and the other events are part of normal system operations. However, the repetition of file existence checks might be something to investigate further if there's a lack of other logs or if the user is in a high-risk environment. But based solely on the provided information, it's not clearly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate a clear security incident or malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate PowerShell Usage:**\n   - **Test-Path Commands:** Multiple PowerShell processes execute `Test-Path` to check for the existence of specific files (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\...`). This is a common administrative task (e.g., verifying dependencies or setup conditions) and not inherently malicious.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created and deleted in the `Temp` directory. This aligns with PowerShell's behavior during execution policy testing or script validation, which is typical in legitimate scenarios.\n\n2. **Windows Defender Interaction:**\n   - **MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll:** These are legitimate Windows Defender components. Their loading by PowerShell does not suggest malicious activity, as PowerShell can interact with antivirus processes during script execution.\n\n3. **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - **No Unusual Network Activity:** No logs of network connections, data exfiltration, or communication with external IPs are present.\n   - **No Privilege Escalation:** No events suggest elevation of privileges or unauthorized access.\n   - **No Malware Signatures:** No known malicious file names, hashes, or behaviors are detected.\n\n4. **Contextual Considerations:**\n   - **User Context:** The user `fiddelis` is not flagged as suspicious, and activities appear to be confined to local file system operations.\n   - **Repetition of Checks:** While the repeated `Test-Path` commands may seem unusual, they could be part of a script verifying prerequisites for an application or deployment process.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not clearly indicative of a security threat**. They align with legitimate administrative tasks, such as script execution policy testing or dependency verification. However, **correlation with additional logs** (e.g., network activity, user behavior, or system changes) could provide further clarity. If this activity occurs in a high-risk environment or alongside other suspicious events, further investigation is warranted. \n\n**Final Verdict:** **No immediate action required** based on the provided data. Monitor for context or additional anomalies."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several entries with PowerShell commands checking if a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in various paths. The command is using Test-Path and exiting 0 or 1 based on that. Now, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that might capture keystrokes, which could be malicious. But just checking if the file exists isn't necessarily bad. However, the fact that it's being checked in multiple different directories might indicate that the attacker is looking for this script in various locations, possibly trying to execute it if found.\n\nThen there are entries about image loads, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are part of .NET runtime, so loading them with PowerShell isn't unusual. The File created event in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script might be normal, but sometimes malware uses temp folders to store malicious scripts. However, the script name here is __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which seems like a legitimate test script. \n\nThere are multiple Process accessed events for PowerShell, which is common in environments where scripts are run. The presence of Calculator.exe and calc.exe with urlmon.dll might be normal, but sometimes attackers use calculator as a decoy. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, the key point is the repeated checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1. If this script is part of a legitimate application, it's okay, but the name suggests keylogging, which is malicious. The fact that the system is checking for this script in multiple paths could indicate an attempt to locate and execute it. However, none of the logs show the script actually being executed or present. The events are all about checking existence, not running it. \n\nBut considering the combination of multiple checks for a potentially malicious script, even if it's not executed, it might be worth investigating. The system could be compromised if the script exists elsewhere, or this could be a false positive. However, the presence of such checks in a batch could be a red flag, especially if there's no corresponding script found. \n\nOn the other hand, the other events don't show clear signs of compromise. The whoami.exe and calculator are normal. The temp file created might be part of a legitimate process. So, maybe this is a false positive, but the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the batch is somewhat interesting but not definitively malicious without more evidence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, but no definitive evidence of compromise. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repeated Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in various directories (e.g., `C:\\tarefa_temporario\\...`, `C:\\unidade_logico\\...`, etc.).\n   - **Why this is suspicious:**\n     - The script name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is commonly associated with **keylogging malware**, which captures user input (e.g., passwords, sensitive data).\n     - The repeated checks across multiple directories could indicate an attempt to **locate and execute** the script if present, possibly as part of a **malicious payload**.\n\n2. **File Creation in Temp Directory:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`.\n   - **Why this is concerning:**\n     - Malware often uses temporary directories to store scripts or payloads.\n     - However, the filename suggests it might be part of a **legitimate PowerShell policy test**, though further analysis is needed.\n\n3. **Normal Activity:**\n   - `whoami.exe` and `calc.exe`\/`Calculator.exe` are standard utilities and not inherently malicious.\n   - Image loads for `.NET` components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and `urlmon.dll` are common in Windows environments.\n\n4. **Lack of Execution:**\n   - No logs show the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` script being executed or found in the system.\n   - No evidence of data exfiltration, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malware:** **Low to Moderate**  \n  The repeated checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` are suspicious, but without confirmation that the script exists or is executed, it could be a **false positive** (e.g., a misconfigured script or benign tool).\n- **Impact:** **Low**  \n  No direct evidence of data theft, system compromise, or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Script:**\n   - Check if the script exists in any of the directories referenced in the logs.\n   - Analyze the script's contents (if found) for malicious behavior (e.g., keylogging, network communication).\n\n2. **Monitor the Temp File:**\n   - Examine the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` to determine its purpose.\n   - Check for any unexpected network activity or changes to system files.\n\n3. **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**\n   - Ensure that PowerShell execution policies (e.g., `RemoteSigned`, `AllSigned`) are configured securely to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n\n4. **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - Use threat intelligence platforms to search for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in known malware databases.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **suspicious patterns** (e.g., repeated checks for a potentially malicious script) but **no confirmed malicious activity**. Further investigation is recommended to rule out compromise or misconfiguration. **Not a high-priority alert**, but **worth monitoring**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and multiple instances of powershell.exe. The svchost and chrome network connections might be normal, but the key here is the powershell activities. \n\nThere are several events related to powershell.exe. The first thing I notice is the command_line entries. The same command is repeated multiple times: \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse...}\". This command is using PowerShell to recursively list files and directories. That's a common legitimate activity, but when it's done multiple times in quick succession, it might be part of a script or a malicious activity trying to gather information.\n\nThen, there are events where PowerShell is setting registry values, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, there's a file created at 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. The creation of a new file might be benign, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it could indicate data being written, possibly exfiltration or logging.\n\nAnother point is the file path in one of the events: 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\assembly\\\\NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64\\\\mscorlib\\\\...\\\\mscorlib.ni.dll'. This is a system file, so loading it might be normal, but if it's being accessed in an unusual way, it could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that might be part of normal operations. But if the user isn't expecting Winlogbeat to be running, that could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands running the same script, registry modifications, file creation, and some system process activities. While some of these could be normal, the repetition and the combination of events might indicate a script that's trying to gather information or modify the system. The presence of the .txt file and the registry changes are more suspicious. However, without more context, like the user's environment or known good behavior, it's a bit tricky. But given the repeated PowerShell commands and the file creation, I'd lean towards this being interesting for further investigation. The confidence is around 0.7 because while there are suspicious elements, they could also be legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing repetitive file enumeration commands (ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse), combined with registry modifications and file creation activities, suggest potential reconnaissance or data collection behavior. The repetition of identical command lines and the creation of a text file in the Downloads directory raise suspicion of automated scripting or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
