This might be due to scripts or commands run within PowerShell.\n\nHere are some potential security implications based on the logs:\n\n- **Unexpected Microsoft Edge Update Activities:** The high frequency of 'Image Loaded' events for Microsoft Edge Update could indicate unusual behavior, such as malware masquerading as updates.\n- **Winlogbeat Process Creation:** The creation of a Winlogbeat process without apparent user interaction might suggest unauthorized software installation. Review the source and permissions of this process.\n- **PowerShell Access:** Unusual PowerShell activities could point towards malicious scripts or commands being executed. Consider reviewing PowerShell logs for signs of suspicious behavior.\n\nTo investigate these potential security concerns further, consider enabling more detailed logging and auditing on the system, as well as examining other related logs such as PowerShell transcripts and network connections."}
