These files all appear to be related to `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` or `.js` files with various hashes.\n\n   - **Observations**:\n     - The same file was created multiple times, suggesting either a system glitch or intentional repeated actions.\n     - No other processes are mentioned in these logs, indicating that only `SDXHelper.exe` is involved in creating these files.\n\n2. **Security Group Management Event**: A single log entry describes a \"Security Group Management\" task with no associated process or file path.\n\n   - **Observations**:\n     - This event is not related to the file creation events and seems isolated.\n     - The lack of process and file information makes it difficult to determine what action was taken or why it occurred.\n\nIn conclusion, `SDXHelper.exe` created numerous instances of files related to `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`, and there was a separate, seemingly unrelated event involving Security Group Management. To understand the cause and implications of these events, further investigation is required."}

This process is likely associated with Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **Task**: The task being performed by this process is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that the SDXHelper process is creating files.\n\n3. **File Path**: The files are being created in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c...\n   ```\n   The specific file names vary and seem to be minified JavaScript (.js) files, possibly for Office Add-ins or other Office-related components.\n\n4. **Duplicate Entries**: You might notice some duplicate entries in the log (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_4dd86f6b38e03fc03eecefd5fa19f188.js`). This suggests that the files are being recreated or overwritten.\n\nHere's a sample entry for better readability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"SDXHelper.exe\"\n  },\n  \"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\",\n  \"file\": {\n    \"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\8c8...4\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_51ac2772753a1f80a49db5c5ff3b94e4.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf these log entries are causing performance issues or you suspect malicious activity, I would recommend reaching out to Microsoft Support or running a virus\/malware scan on your system.

Here's a summary of what we can infer from these logs:\n\n1. **File Creation**: The process `SDXHelper.exe` is creating new files in the specified location.\n\n2. **File Names**: The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a unique hash (e.g., `75e083f2c5a2fd46348d91eeca87bafc`). This suggests that these are likely minimized JavaScript files related to the Office Assistant Copilot feature.\n\n3. **Potential Issue**: The repetition of some filenames (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_7bbcea0e29cbd6a23375d3e16b983098.js`) might indicate a possible error in file creation or overwriting. It could be due to concurrent processes or an issue with the file creation logic.\n\n4. **Process Involved**: The `SDXHelper.exe` process is involved, which is typically associated with Microsoft Office products, particularly in relation to updates and assistance features.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Check if there are any error messages or warnings related to these files being created.\n- Verify if these files are expected and required for the Office Assistant Copilot feature to function correctly.\n- Monitor the system for any performance issues or other anomalies that might be related to this repeated file creation behavior."}
