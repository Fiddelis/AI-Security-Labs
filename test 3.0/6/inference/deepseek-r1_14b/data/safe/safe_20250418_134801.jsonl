{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of logs to see if they're interesting for investigation. First, I notice a lot of events related to process creations and file activities. For instance, there are multiple entries from CompatTelRunner.exe loading various DLLs, which is pretty standard and not unusual.\n\nThen there's the setup.exe creating files, which could be part of an update or installation process. EdgeUpdate components might be updating the browser, so that seems normal too. The services.exe and svchost.exe logs are common for system services, nothing suspicious here at first glance.\n\nThe powershell.exe command catches my eye because it's being used with a specific script to check .inf files. This could indicate something malicious, as attackers sometimes use PowerShell for tasks like this. However, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which might limit its privileges but isn't necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nThere are several User Account Management events without any context, which doesn't provide enough info to be concerning. The DNS query from chrome.exe is normal browser activity. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file is likely just data collection software running.\n\nMultiple RegistryEvent tasks from svchost.exe could be part of legitimate system operations or potentially malicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems benign as it's standard behavior for some apps.\n\nThe last entry about BthAvctpSvc might be related to Bluetooth services; unless there's a known issue with that service, it shouldn't raise flags.\n\nPutting it all together, while some elements like the PowerShell command and multiple process creations could warrant closer look, they don't collectively indicate malicious activity.

Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory—probably just logging data, nothing suspicious.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again looks like standard Windows processes. Svchost.exe creating files related to Delivery Optimization sounds legitimate. There are multiple entries from svchost.exe under different paths, but these seem to be cache and state files for services, which is normal.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file in its download directory makes sense during updates. MpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related DLLs is standard antivirus behavior. The deletion of an Edge update file in the Temp folder isn't unusual either.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values—these are often used by command-line tools, so nothing fishy there.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a set of JSONL events to analyze. My task is to determine whether this batch of events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each event, they all seem consistent. Each line represents a single JSON object with three main keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key contains the name \"git.exe\", which tells me that Git is being used here. The winlog indicates that a file was created, specifically pointing to the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all within the node_modules folder of a directory named after a course, S206 - Qualidade de Software.\n\nI notice that each event has a different file path under the functions folder in semver. For example, compare-build.js, compare-loose.js, and so on. All these files belong to the semver package, which is related to versioning in Node.js applications.\n\nNow, considering Git's role here: when you clone a repository or perform operations like checkout, Git might be accessing various files, including those under node_modules. Since these are standard files for the semver module, their creation could be part of the normal build process, especially if someone is working on a project that involves versioning.\n\nBut wait, why so many file creations? It seems like multiple function files from semver are being created in quick succession. Could this be indicative of something malicious, like an attacker trying to inject or replace these functions? Or is it more likely just part of the Git checkout process when pulling down a project's dependencies?\n\nI recall that during development, especially with Node.js projects, cloning repositories often involves installing dependencies, which would create these files in node_modules. So this might be normal behavior for someone developing software using Git.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the context in which these events occurred. Are there other logs around this time indicating unusual activity? Since I don't have that information, I can only analyze what's provided. \n\nAnother angle: could an attacker be using Git to exfiltrate data or inject malicious code? While possible, the act of creating files within node_modules doesn't inherently indicate malice. It's more about the surrounding actions and whether they deviate from normal patterns.\n\nThe paths all point to legitimate function files within a known module. There's no indication of any executable or script being created elsewhere, which might have raised more flags. All activities are confined to the functions folder, suggesting standard operations rather than malicious intent.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious, the events described here seem to align with typical development activities involving Git and Node.js modules. Without evidence of additional suspicious actions or deviations from expected behavior, there's no strong reason to classify this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation by Git during development activities, specifically within a Node.js project's dependencies.

Git is often involved in downloading or updating these modules when working with repositories. So, it makes sense that git.exe would be creating files in a node_modules folder during an install or update process.\n\nI don't see any unusual file paths here. All the files are standard parts of the semver package—JavaScript files, JSON, and other internal scripts. There's no indication of malicious activity like accessing sensitive directories, creating hidden files, or writing to unexpected locations outside the node_modules scope.\n\nSince all events are related to the normal operation of a Node.js module being installed or updated, there doesn't seem to be any cause for concern.

Each event is a JSON object, and they all seem to be related to file creation tasks triggered by the \"git.exe\" process. The paths in each file event are under a directory named after a user: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis...\". \n\nHmm, the files being created are within a folder called \"node_modules\", which is typical for Node.js projects because node_modules is where dependencies are stored. Each entry shows that a different file or subdirectory is being created, like package.json, index.js, README.md, etc. These are standard files you'd expect in a Node.js module.\n\nLooking at the process name, it's git.exe, which suggests that Git is being used to manage these files. Maybe this is part of a repository setup or during a clone operation where files are being checked out and created locally. The tasks are all FileCreate events, so they're just file creation activities.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here.

My task is to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation based on these logs.\n\nLooking at the data, each line represents an event. The key elements in each event are:\n- **process**: The name of the process that created or modified a file.\n- **winlog**: A dictionary with the task indicating what happened (in this case, all events have \"File created\" as the task).\n- **file**: Details about the file, specifically its path.\n\nAll the events show that git.exe is creating files in specific locations. The paths are all within a folder named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which seems to be related to a course on software quality. Under this folder, there are several node_modules directories being created, each with various files like package.json, index.js, and others.\n\nNow, I need to determine if these events are interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Since all the processes are git.exe creating files in what looks like a project directory, it seems like normal development activity. The creation of node_modules suggests that someone is setting up or updating a Node.js project, which is common in software development.\n\nI should consider whether such activities could be indicative of malicious behavior. Malicious actors often try to disguise their actions as legitimate ones. However, in this case, the file paths and the nature of the files created are typical for a Node.js module setup. There's nothing here that stands out as unusual or suspicious, like unexpected file creation outside user directories or creation of executable files without a clear purpose.\n\nAdditionally, all events are from the same process (git.exe), which is commonly used in development environments to clone repositories and manage modules. The repeated FileCreate tasks also align with the normal operation of expanding or initializing a project's dependencies.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern or anomaly in the number of files being created. Since each event is creating one file, and they're all within a known software project structure, it doesn't seem like an excessive number that might indicate a brute force attack or unauthorized access.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether these events could be part of a larger sequence indicating compromise. For instance, if there were unusual files created elsewhere or if the timestamps indicated rapid, unexplained activity, that might raise flags. But in this batch alone, everything appears routine.\n\nMoreover, the file paths are all within a user's Downloads directory, which is a common place to store downloaded projects or materials. The presence of .editorconfig and .eslintrc files further supports the idea that this is related to software development rather than malicious activity.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor for any unexpected activities, based on the information provided, these events don't indicate anything suspicious.

Each event is a JSON object with information about a file creation on the Windows system. The process name is always \"git.exe,\" and each task is labeled as \"File created\" under a specific rule.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events are happening within the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. This seems to be related to a course or project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software,\" which translates to something like \"Software Quality\" in Portuguese.\n\nLooking closer, the files being created are part of two different node_modules directories: one for \"side-channel\" and another for \"signal-exit\" and \"slice-ansi.\" These look like npm packages because they have standard file structures for Node.js modules—like package.json, index.js, README.md, etc. The presence of these files suggests that someone is installing or updating JavaScript packages using npm.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is the process creating all these files makes sense because when you clone a repository or pull updates from Git, it can trigger npm install commands if there's a package-lock.json or yarn.lock file present, which would then create these module files. This is a normal part of the development workflow for someone using JavaScript or TypeScript.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There are no unusual file paths, nor are there any executables being created outside of standard npm package structures. All the files are within the expected locations for node_modules, which are typically managed by the developer during the build process.\n\nThe repetition of similar events could be a bit noisy if someone isn't used to seeing them, but in this context, it's clear that this is part of a legitimate software development activity.

That's a user directory, probably where someone is working on a project. The node_modules folder suggests it's related to Node.js and npm packages.

All the events are JSONL format, each line is a separate JSON object. \n\nFirst, I notice that every event has \"git.exe\" as the process name. Git is a version control system, commonly used for software development. It's not inherently malicious, but sometimes attackers might use it for lateral movement or to exfiltrate data.\n\nThe task in each log is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means a file was created on the filesystem. The files are located under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\sshpk\". \n\nLooking at the paths, \"node_modules\" suggests this is related to Node.js packages.

Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nEach event has three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\". The winlog task says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means the system logged that a file was created. The file paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software, and then they go into node_modules with various package names like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, etc.\n\nHmm, so what's happening here? Git is involved in creating files. Node modules are being created or modified. This looks a lot like someone installing Node.js packages. When you run `npm install`, it downloads and extracts packages into the node_modules directory. Each package has its own files, which explains why there are multiple file creation events for different paths under node_modules.\n\nIs this normal? Definitely. If someone is working with JavaScript or Node.js projects, npm install would create all these files as part of the dependency installation process. The fact that they're all being created by git.exe might be a bit odd because I usually associate npm with node.exe or other npm scripts, but maybe in some setups, git could be used to check out or manage package repositories.\n\nBut wait, is there any indication of malicious activity here? Let me think. Malicious behavior would typically involve things like unusual file creation locations, files executed from unexpected places, process names that don't match the action, or access to sensitive files. Here, all the paths are within a user's downloads directory and node_modules, which is standard for development.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be part of a larger attack where the initial infection uses git.exe to drop malicious files? But without more events showing unusual behavior like file deletions, writes to system directories, or network connections, it's hard to say. However, based on the given data alone, these are typical actions during a Node.js setup.\n\nAlso, considering that each event is just creating a file and nothing else, there's no evidence of any harmful operations being performed on those files. No execution, no modification beyond creation, no copying to other directories. It seems purely related to installing packages.\n\nI should also think about the confidence level.

So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and my task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output needs to be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one. Each line starts with a process named \"git.exe\". The event type is a file creation, as indicated by \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files being created are located in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" followed by various package names like strip-json-comments, supports-color, tcomb-validation, and tcomb. Each of these packages has subfiles like index.js, license, package.json, etc.\n\nSo, I notice that all events are from the same process (git.exe) creating files in a node_modules directory. Node_modules is typically where Node.js packages are stored when you install them using npm. This suggests that someone might be installing or updating JavaScript packages on their system. Git being involved could mean they're working on a version control project, possibly a software development environment.\n\nI need to assess if this activity is normal or suspicious. Installing node modules via git doesn't seem unusual for a developer's workflow. It's common to see such file creations during the setup or update of a project's dependencies. The fact that all these files are related to Node.js packages and their metadata (like licenses, READMEs) supports the idea that this is part of standard development activities.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior here? I don't see anything red flags. No signs of file deletions, access to sensitive areas outside node_modules, or unexpected processes. It's just a series of file creations in a typical location for software development tools.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, since all events are consistent with normal development activities and there's no evidence of unusual behavior, I would rate the confidence as low that this batch is interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show file creations related to Node.js packages during installation or update.

Each event is a \"File created\" log in Windows, specifically under the rule FileCreate. The file paths all point to various files and subdirectories within C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb.\n\nFirst off, I notice that every entry has the same process name, git.exe, which is commonly associated with version control systems. Git often interacts with file systems when cloning repositories, updating files, or performing other operations. So, it's not unusual for git.exe to create multiple files in a directory, especially during an initial clone or when installing dependencies.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all reside under node_modules\/tcomb. This suggests that these are likely part of a Node.js project. The tcomb library is a popular type checking library for JavaScript, so having its files being created makes sense if someone is setting up or modifying a project that uses it.\n\nEach event creates a different file—some are .js and .d.ts files, others are in the lib directory with various filenames like Any.js, Array.js, etc. This looks like standard behavior when a Node module is being installed or updated, as npm (Node Package Manager) typically downloads and extracts such files into the node_modules folder.\n\nI should consider whether these activities could be indicative of malicious behavior. Malware often creates files in unexpected locations or attempts to modify system files. However, here all files are within user directories and typical project folders, which aligns with legitimate user activity. There's no indication of file creation in system directories or other red flag locations.\n\nAnother point is the number of events. While 19 seems like a lot, it's feasible when installing multiple dependencies or during a large operation. Git can clone many files at once, especially if the repository has several files in subdirectories.\n\nI also note that each event is consistent in structure and origin. There's no variation in the process name or file creation tasks, which might hint at automated or malicious script activity. Instead, it looks like normal development workflow.\n\nConsidering all this, these events don't raise any red flags.

My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each event contains. Each line is a JSON object with three keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The \"process\" key has the name of an executable, which in all these cases is \"git.exe\". The \"winlog\" indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule called \"FileCreate\". The \"file\" key gives the path where the file was created.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be located within a user's directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\.

The creation of multiple JavaScript files under tcomb suggests that perhaps someone is installing or updating dependencies, which would involve downloading and extracting these files.\n\nI don't immediately see any red flags here. Creating files during a npm install or similar operation is a normal part of the development process. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file creation times, or attempts to execute these files.
