{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command line in some events shows \"& {Get-Date}\", which seems like it's just getting the current date—so maybe not suspicious on its own. But when combined with other actions, it could be part of a script.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value sets from powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, allowing them to persist across reboots. This is definitely something to watch out for because attackers often set or modify registry keys to maintain their presence on the system.\n\nI also see multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, sometimes attackers use PowerShell to load malicious libraries or bypass certain security restrictions by using these methods.\n\nThere's a file creation event for a .ps1 script in the Temporary directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1\". Then immediately after that, there's a FileDeleteDetected event. This seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file quickly could be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence, or it might be testing the environment for certain policies.\n\nAdditionally, there are PipeCreated events from powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which attackers might exploit to hide command-line arguments or exfiltrate data.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file in the Downloads folder named \"estrutura_logico.txt\". While not inherently suspicious, it's worth checking if this file was created by expected processes and if its content aligns with legitimate activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell.exe instances with registry modifications, image loads, pipe creations, temporary script creation\/deletion, and file creation in user directories—this combination raises flags. It seems like there might be some scripting or automated process that's either trying to cover its tracks or is part of malicious activity.\n\nMoreover, the variety of tasks performed by powershell.exe across multiple events suggests a potential script or tool being used, which could be indicative of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence. The use of temporary files and quick deletion might be an attempt to avoid detection mechanisms.\n\nHowever, some events like file creations for .yml configuration files (from winlogbeat.exe) are normal and don't raise concerns. But the concentration of powershell activities with these specific tasks leans towards something potentially malicious.\n\nIn summary, while not all individual actions are suspicious, the pattern and combination of multiple events related to powershell.exe performing registry modifications, creating temporary scripts, deleting them quickly, and other system interactions suggest a possible security incident that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes and Their Actions:**\n   - Multiple entries from `powershell.exe` are present.\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates configuration files; likely benign.\n\n2. **Analyze Powershell Activities:**\n   - Command lines show `& {Get-Date}`, seemingly innocuous but often part of scripts.\n   - Registry modifications (RegistryEvent) can indicate persistence mechanisms.\n   - ImageLoad events loading DLLs could be legitimate or malicious.\n\n3. **File Operations:**\n   - Creation and deletion of a temporary .ps1 file raises suspicion; possibly attempting to execute without leaving evidence.\n   - File creation in the Downloads folder might be part of data handling or storage.\n\n4. **Pipe Events:**\n   - PipeCreated events suggest inter-process communication, potentially for hiding commands or exfiltration.\n\n5. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Concentration of suspicious activities around powershell.exe suggests a script or tool in use.\n   - Temp file behavior and registry changes point to possible malicious intent.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of events indicates potential malicious activity, necessitating further investigation into the nature of these processes and their impact on system security.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch contains multiple suspicious activities related to powershell.exe, including registry modifications, temporary script creation\/deletion, and pipe creations. These patterns suggest a possible security incident requiring investigation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interested\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"process_activities\": {\n      \"powershell_registry_modifications\": \"Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms.\",\n      \"temporary_script_handling\": \"Creating and deleting scripts quickly may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.\",\n      \"pipe_creations\": \"Used for communication, potentially malicious.\",\n      \"suspicious_file_creations\": \"File creation in user directories without clear benign justification.\"\n    },\n    \"combined_pattern\": \"The combination of these activities suggests potential malicious intent.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of three JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe with a task indicating \"Registry value set.\" PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious. Registry changes could be part of installing malware or persistence mechanisms. This alone raises an eyebrow, but I need context.\n\nSecond event: Again, powershell.exe, this time accessing something (ProcessAccess). Accessing certain registry keys or files without proper authorization might indicate malicious activity. Combined with the first event, it suggests possible unauthorized modifications.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. WinLogBeat is likely an agent for the Elastic Stack used for log management. The file created seems like a configuration file path (.winlogbeat.yml.new). This is normal if it's part of setting up log collection, but I wonder why it was created. If this process doesn't usually create files here, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at all three together: Two PowerShell events with registry and access tasks, then a legitimate process creating a file. The first two could be signs of malicious activity, especially if they're happening around the same time as the third event. Maybe an attacker is trying to set up persistence (using Registry) while another process logs or configures something.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these are all part of normal operations, especially since sometimes scripts use PowerShell for tasks. But without more context, the combination seems concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't super high but there's definitely some red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events indicating potential malicious activity involving powershell.exe accessing and modifying system components, which could be signs of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
