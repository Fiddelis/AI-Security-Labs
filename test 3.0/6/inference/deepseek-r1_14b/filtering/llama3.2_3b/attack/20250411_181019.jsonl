Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event shows cmd.exe running a command that creates a service using sc create. The command line is a bit unusual—it's trying to execute another script from a path like \"c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". NonExistingScript suggests this file doesn't exist, which might be an indicator of something malicious because attackers often use such files to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process accessed event. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so it raises some flags. I should keep an eye on how many times it appears and what other events are associated with it.\n\nThe third event is sc.exe creating another service with a similar non-existent script path. This repetition makes me think there's a pattern here—maybe the attacker is trying to create multiple services or perhaps this is part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking further down, several events show services.exe setting registry values multiple times. Services.exe usually handles system services, so changes in the registry could indicate an attempt to modify service configurations, which might be malicious if not expected.\n\nThere are also instances where various processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, cmd.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe are accessing or modifying registry values. While some of these are normal, especially for services and background processes, the frequency here seems high enough to warrant attention.\n\nAdditionally, two events show Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll from the system32 directory. That's unusual because Calculator typically doesn't need such libraries, and loading them could be an attempt to hide malicious code or inject something into a legitimate process.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are accessing registry values multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry for various settings, multiple accesses without a clear reason might indicate suspicious activity, especially if combined with other events.\n\nFinally, cmd.exe setting a registry value and powershell.exe accessed again—this reinforces the idea that there's a sequence of activities that could be part of an attack chain, like initial access followed by service creation and persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple attempts to create services using non-existent scripts, repeated registry modifications, unusual file loads, and multiple process accesses. These points suggest potential malicious activity, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as service creation attempts with non-existent scripts, unusual file loads, and repeated registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
