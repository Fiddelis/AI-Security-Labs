{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries related to both Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe processes. The Chrome-related events show tasks like DNS queries and network connections. While these aren't inherently suspicious on their own, seeing a lot of them might raise an eyebrow if they're unusual for the user's activity.\n\nBut the more concerning part is the PowerShell activities. I see several entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that download files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to different paths under various organizations like \"objeto_base\", \"unidade_base\", and others, all trying to save files in the TEMP directory with names like modulo_padrao.txt or tarefa_auxiliar.txt.\n\nThis behavior stands out because downloading files directly from a web client within PowerShell can be a common technique used in scripting, but it's also a red flag for potential malicious activities. It might indicate that an attacker is attempting to download and execute scripts or tools from remote repositories on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files are created and then deleted shortly after, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1 being created and then deleted. This could be a tactic to avoid detection by quickly removing traces of malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated network connections detected from Chrome.exe. While browsing naturally involves such activities, the combination with PowerShell's external file downloads makes me consider if there's a correlation or a more significant event happening across these processes.\n\nThe registry modifications and image loads in PowerShell could be part of establishing persistence or altering system configurations to facilitate further malicious actions. The pipe creation and file operations also add to the suspicion that something is amiss.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple indicators that could suggest command-line activity indicative of scripting or potential malware execution, especially with the repeated attempts to download files from external sources via PowerShell. This pattern isn't typical for standard user behavior and might warrant further investigation to check if these activities are legitimate or part of a larger attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell processes downloading files from external repositories, which may indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events. The first thing I notice is multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values, which isn't unusual since browsers often interact with the registry for settings.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be legitimate but is also a common tool for attackers because it allows execution of scripts and downloading files. Looking at one event, powershell.exe is downloading something from a GitHub repository to a temp file. That could indicate malicious activity since downloading from an arbitrary site might be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's a cmd.exe command deleting a scheduled task using SCHTASKS. This could be part of an attempt to remove traces of previous activities or to hide malicious tasks, which is a red flag for potential attacks.\n\nCombined, the powershell download and the cmd deletion are concerning. The multiple registry changes by various processes might be attempts to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, which are common tactics in malware.\n\nSo, while some events on their own might not raise alarms, together they suggest possible malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe processes performing suspicious activities, including downloading files from a GitHub repository and deleting scheduled tasks, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nFirst, I notice several instances where system commands are being executed, like 'schtasks.exe' and 'cmd.exe'. The command lines show actions such as deleting tasks and registry entries. For example, the event with 'schtasks.exe \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F' suggests someone is trying to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Similarly, there's a cmd command deleting registry keys under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for values like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". These actions could be attempts to remove persistence mechanisms that attackers use to maintain access to the system.\n\nNext, multiple PowerShell processes are present. PowerShell is commonly used in both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The events show 'powershell.exe' being created, accessed, and interacting with registry entries. Notably, there's a command line that looks suspicious: \"powershell.exe & {}\", which might be an attempt to execute arbitrary code or load malicious scripts. Additionally, the repeated loading of .NET framework components by PowerShell could indicate the use of obfuscation or attempts to execute malicious commands without being detected easily.\n\nLooking at other processes like 'whoami.exe' and 'conhost.exe', these are typically used for system information gathering. The repeated creation of these processes might be part of an attack chain where the attacker is checking system details or attempting to elevate privileges.\n\nThe combination of deleting tasks, modifying registry entries, and using PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines raises red flags. These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior and could indicate efforts to clean up traces of malware, establish persistence, or execute payloads.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's clear that there are multiple indicators pointing towards potential malicious activity. The use of several different tools and the nature of the commands executed make this batch of logs worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially malicious activities, including deletion of tasks, registry modifications, and suspicious PowerShell usage, indicative of possible attack behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query where the user is asking me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. First off, I need to understand what exactly they're looking for.\n\nThey provided a series of JSONL events, each representing different log entries. My task is to go through all these events as a whole and decide if the entire batch should be flagged as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". Plus, I have to return just one classification with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the logs, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. The events include file creations, deletions, registry changes, and image loads. Specifically, there are multiple instances where files are being created and then deleted in temporary directories, which could indicate script execution or testing of some sort.\n\nOne event stands out: the creation and quick deletion of a PowerShell script file in the Temp directory. This might be an attempt to run malicious code temporarily to avoid detection. Also, repeated registry modifications can sometimes be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers to maintain access to a system.\n\nHowever, while these activities could be suspicious, they don't definitively prove malicious intent on their own. It's possible that a user is running scripts for legitimate reasons or testing. But the combination of multiple PowerShell instances, file operations in temp directories, and registry changes does raise eyebrows.\n\nI also see other processes like cmd.exe and conhost.exe, which are often used in command-line attacks but again could be part of normal system administration. The use of whoami.exe might just be checking user permissions, which isn't inherently malicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the batch shows a pattern that's more than just normal activity. It demonstrates behaviors that could align with reconnaissance or early stages of an attack, like credential dumping or lateral movement. But without additional context or evidence of direct exploitation, it's still on the border between interesting and not.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events suggests potential malicious activity, but my confidence isn't 100% since there are possible benign explanations too.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious file operations and registry modifications. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior, such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers because it's powerful and can be used for malicious activities. That already raises a red flag.\n\nLooking closer, there are several ImageLoad tasks from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like clrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. Legitimate processes do load DLLs, but some of these might be part of known malware or persistence mechanisms. For example, if these DLLs are related to malicious activities, that's concerning.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. Temporary scripts can be suspicious because attackers often use them to execute malicious code without leaving long-term traces. The fact that this file is created and then deleted shortly after (File Delete logged) might indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point of interest is the ProcessCreate event for whoami.exe. While whoami is a legitimate command, it's sometimes used by attackers to gather information about the system. However, in this case, since it's called from powershell.exe, it could be part of a larger malicious script trying to enumerate user privileges or system details.\n\nThere are multiple RegistryEvent entries, which show that processes are modifying the Windows registry. This can be a sign of persistence mechanisms where malware adds entries to start on boot or modify system configurations. The fact that both powershell.exe and chrome.exe (which is usually benign) are making registry changes could be worth investigating—maybe the attacker is using a legitimate process as a vector.\n\nThe command line for one of the powershell.exe processes is interesting: it's removing an item from TEMP, specifically objeto_principal.zip. Using Remove-Item to delete files might be part of cleaning up evidence after executing malicious activities. Attempting to remove such files could indicate that the script was doing something malicious before deletion.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple powershell.exe instances performing actions like creating temporary scripts, loading DLLs, accessing processes, modifying registry entries, and deleting files. These behaviors don't necessarily prove malware activity on their own, but they do raise suspicions. The combination of these activities could be indicative of a script trying to hide its tracks or perform malicious tasks.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some actions can be benign, the pattern here—especially the file creation\/deletion and registry modifications—points towards potential malicious behavior. However, without more context or additional logs showing actual malicious commands or payloads, it's hard to be certain. Still, the indicators are enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show suspicious activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and attempts to remove temporary files, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"HIGH\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst off, most of these events involve PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement and executing malicious scripts. The fact that there are multiple instances where files are being created and then deleted quickly makes me suspicious. For example, the file paths like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1\" seem temporary and might be part of a script execution test or persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking closer, there are several events where PowerShell is removing specific files in the TEMP directory. The commands use Remove-Item with different .zip and .txt files. This could indicate an attempt to clean up traces of previous activities, which is common in malware behavior. Also, the repeated registry value sets might be part of establishing persistence or modifying system configurations.\n\nAnother point is the command lines in PowerShell. They're obfuscated but seem to target specific files in the TEMP directory with wildcard names, like \"estrutura_comum.zip\" and others. This pattern suggests that the attacker might be trying multiple file patterns to ensure all relevant traces are removed.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was executed. While this could be legitimate, it's often used by attackers to check permissions or identify system information, so in combination with other events, it adds concern.\n\nThe variety of tasks logged—like Image loaded, File created, and Registry changes—all point towards a potential attack chain. The fact that these activities are happening in quick succession and involve multiple files being deleted is concerning.\n\nI also note that not all events are from PowerShell; there's one from chrome.exe accessing registry values and another from conhost.exe. However, the majority remain suspicious, especially considering the repeated file deletions and PowerShell's known misuse.\n\nOverall, while some of these actions could be legitimate (like normal script execution or cleanup), the combination—especially the multiple file deletions in TEMP and use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments—strongly suggests malicious activity. The confidence level is high because the pattern matches common attack tactics.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated PowerShell.exe activities including file creation, deletion, and registry modifications, indicative of potential malicious behavior such as script execution or cleanup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The events are all in JSONL format, each representing a log entry from what looks like Windows systems.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries involve 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so it's a red flag. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing processes, modifying registry values, loading images, creating files, and deleting them. Specifically, there are events showing file creation and deletion in temporary directories like the user's Temp folder. For example, a script named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1' was created and then deleted right after. This pattern could indicate that a malicious script is being dropped, executed, and cleaned up to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are several attempts to remove files in the TEMP directory using Remove-Item commands. These deletions target specific .txt files related to things like 'registro_auxiliar', 'registro_comum', and others. The fact that these files are in the TEMP folder and being deleted might suggest an attempt to cover tracks or modify system configurations temporarily.\n\nLooking at other processes, there's a 'whoami.exe' execution which is often used by attackers to gather information about the user account they're running under. Combined with powershell.exe, this could be part of initial access or privilege escalation tactics.\n\nOn the other hand, some events are more mundane. The 'winlogbeat.exe' creating its configuration file and Chrome making registry changes aren't unusual and likely don't pose a threat on their own.\n\nConsidering the overall batch, there's a concerning pattern of PowerShell activity that includes file manipulation in temp directories and deletion attempts, which could be indicators of malicious behavior such as script execution or data exfiltration. While not all events are suspicious, the combination raises enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes performing file operations and registry modifications, including deletions in temporary directories, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events involve chrome.exe setting registry values. That's normal since browsers often interact with the registry for settings and extensions. No red flags there.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe also setting a registry value. Again, this is typical Windows behavior, especially for services managing runtime components.\n\nNext, I see whoami.exe being executed multiple times. Whoami is a standard system command used to get user information, so unless it's part of an unusual script or run with elevated privileges, it's not suspicious on its own.\n\nPowershell.exe appears frequently here. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers. The mere presence isn't concerning, but the specific commands would be key. However, in these logs, there's no indication of any malicious scripts or unusual command lines—just generic process access events.\n\nLooking at the file creation events: winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file, which is expected from monitoring tools. Powershell creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt doesn't inherently raise alarms; it could be part of legitimate scripting or data processing.\n\nI don't see any signs of known malicious activities like unauthorized access attempts, writes to restricted areas, or processes that shouldn't run on the system. Everything seems to fall within normal user activity and standard tool operations.\n\nSo, considering all events together, there's nothing unusual or indicative of malicious behavior. The batch doesn't warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal system processes and activities such as browser updates, process creations, and file operations that are not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
