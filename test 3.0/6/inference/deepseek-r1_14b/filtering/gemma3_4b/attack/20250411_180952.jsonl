{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe showing network connections. That's normal for a browser or system process accessing the internet, so probably not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen I see several instances where powershell.exe is being used with tasks like ProcessAccess and Registry value sets. PowerShell can be legitimate but it's often abused in attacks. The command-line details would be key here. Looking closer, the command lines aren't provided for these processes, which makes it harder to assess if they're doing something malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple 'cmd.exe' entries with specific commands adding users and groups to the domain. Commands like \"net user\" and \"net group\" can be used by attackers to create new accounts or add existing ones to administrative groups. The usernames here have patterns like '_Admin', which seems unusual for standard administration practices. Also, the passwords used are simple (e.g., 'registro_temporario_pass123!')—not typical of secure password policies.\n\nThere are also processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a known tool for log management, so that's probably benign. Conhost.exe can be used by malicious scripts to host payloads, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repeated attempts to create users and add them to the Domain Admins group are concerning. This activity could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access within the domain. The fact that multiple commands use similar naming conventions and permissions suggests a coordinated effort, possibly by an attacker trying to establish persistence or move laterally within the network.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—potentially malicious process activities, unusual user creation patterns, and repeated suspicious actions—it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation. There's a high confidence that these events might indicate malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creations and network connections, including suspicious activities like user additions with unusual names and patterns in command lines indicative of potential privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
