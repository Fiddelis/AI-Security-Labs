So, the user has given me a bunch of JSONL events and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are about processes like RuntimeBroker.exe accessing things. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Also, calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll might be suspicious since those files can be linked to malware.\n\nNext, I notice svchost.exe setting registry values several times. Svchost is a legitimate process, but it's commonly targeted by malware, so multiple registry writes could indicate something fishy.\n\nThere are events where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. That seems normal if it's part of log management, but I should check if this activity is expected in the system.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. This is often used to get user information, which can be part of reconnaissance by attackers.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times again with ProcessAccess tasks. This repetition could mean someone is trying to run scripts or commands via PowerShell, possibly malicious.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe also show registry writes, adding more points of concern.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe being used with a command to delete notepad.exe processes. Using wmic to delete processes is another red flag because it's often used in persistence mechanisms by malware.\n\nThere are multiple instances where chrome.exe interacts with the registry and creates pipes. While Chrome can be legitimate, excessive registry activity might indicate tampering or malicious scripts running within the browser.\n\nWMIC.exe is also present with process creation and image loading events. WMIC is another tool that's commonly abused for command execution and lateral movement in attacks.\n\nI should consider if these activities are normal or part of a user's typical behavior. For instance, legitimate use of PowerShell and cmd would be expected in some environments, but the frequency and combination might not be usual.\n\nThe high number of registry writes across different processes (svchost, powershell, etc.) is concerning because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThe repeated attempts to delete notepad.exe using wmic and cmd could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt normal system functions.\n\nOverall, while some events might look innocent on their own, the combination—especially multiple suspicious processes, excessive registry modifications, and commands aimed at process deletion—points towards potential malicious activity. This makes the batch of logs interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe with suspicious command lines indicating potential malicious activities such as process deletion and registry manipulation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, schtasks.exe, and conhost.exe. Each event seems to be a different process with various actions logged.\n\nStarting with chrome.exe: It appears several times with tasks related to registry value sets. Registry modifications can be concerning because attackers often tweak system settings or create persistence mechanisms through the registry. However, legitimate applications also modify the registry frequently, so this alone might not raise red flags unless it's unusual for Chrome.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe appearing multiple times. PowerShell is a powerful tool and commonly used by both admins and attackers. The events show tasks like 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set'. Accessing processes or modifying registries with PowerShell can be part of legitimate administration tasks, but they're also common in attacks for lateral movement or persistence.\n\nLooking at cmd.exe entries: These are quite a few. Commands include copying files, deleting scheduled tasks, and empty command lines. For example, one event shows 'copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe'. This looks like an attempt to replace system binaries, which could be malicious if done without proper authorization. Similarly, deleting a task with schtasks might disrupt normal operations or hide traces of malware.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' processes are interesting too. They're typically used to retrieve user information, but repeated executions could indicate privilege escalation attempts or reconnaissance. However, on its own, it's not necessarily malicious unless combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nschtasks.exe is involved in deleting a task named 'win32times'.Scheduled tasks are often used by attackers for persistence or delayed execution of malicious scripts. Deleting such a task might be part of cleaning up after an attack or disrupting legitimate scheduled operations.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command line is '\/c ', which seems incomplete. This could mean the process didn't execute any command, but it's unusual and might indicate some form of obfuscation or failed execution attempt.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch shows a series of activities that include registry modifications, process access, file copying\/deletion, and task management. These actions collectively suggest potential malicious behavior. For instance, replacing system files (sethc.exe) is a common technique to replace legitimate tools with malicious ones. Deleting scheduled tasks could remove evidence or disable protective measures. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe with such commands adds to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these activities could be part of normal system maintenance or user actions. For example, updating software might involve registry changes, and admins might legitimately delete old tasks. But given the combination—multiple process creations, registry edits, file replacements, and task deletions—it leans more towards malicious intent.\n\nConfidence level: High. The pattern suggests a coordinated set of activities that could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, process access, file replacements, and task deletions indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple instances of `chrome.exe` loading different DLLs. While Chrome is a common process, repeated image loads could be suspicious if they involve unexpected files, but here they seem standard like `amsi.dll` which is related to anti-malware scanning. Not immediately concerning.\n\nNext, I see `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` performing registry operations. Registry changes can be part of legitimate activities, but multiple instances might hint at something more. However, without specific malicious file paths or known bad indicators, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are several events involving `powershell.exe`. This is a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script loading. The process accesses various files and registry keys, which could be part of legitimate administration tasks but also potential malicious activities. Notably, there's an event where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`. This is suspicious because script creation in the Temp folder isn't typical for standard operations and could be used to execute malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated use of `powershell.exe` with different command lines raises concerns about potential process injection or persistence mechanisms. The combination of file creation and registry modifications by PowerShell strongly suggests possible malicious activity, such as establishing persistence or downloading additional payloads.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events could be benign, the concentration on suspicious activities involving PowerShell, especially the script creation in an unusual location, makes this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe performing potentially malicious actions, including file creation and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first log shows PowerShell.exe deleting a file. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. The path seems like it's in the Temp folder, which is common for temporary scripts or files that might be part of a payload.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where the command line is 'powershell.exe & {}'. I'm not sure what this does exactly, but repeated PowerShell executions could indicate some automation or script execution happening. The tasks under winlog vary—some are Provider Lifecycle events, which might just be normal operations, but the repetition makes me think something's off.\n\nI also notice that several events don't have file paths associated with them, so it's hard to tell what files they're interacting with, if any. There's an event where a .yml file is being created by winlogbeat.exe, which I'm not too familiar with, but since it's related to log collection, maybe it's just normal activity.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell accessing another process and creating files in the StartupProfileData directory, which might be storing some configuration or data for the next session. Then there are a couple of Registry value sets by both PowerShell and conhost.exe, which could be part of persistence mechanisms to maintain access across reboots.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, I see multiple instances where PowerShell is checking if certain .bat files exist using Test-Path. This seems like it's testing for the presence of specific scripts or files as a way to determine whether to proceed with further actions. If these are part of an execution flow, they might be components of malicious activities.\n\nI'm also considering if all this activity aligns with normal user behavior. Someone running multiple PowerShell commands and checking various file paths seems unusual unless it's part of legitimate script execution or system administration. But the combination of file deletions, repeated script checks, registry modifications, and process accesses makes me lean towards suspicious behavior.\n\nHowever, without more context on what these scripts are doing or if they're authorized, it's hard to be certain. The high number of events related to PowerShell and the specific operations like file deletion and registry changes increase my concern. This could indicate a potential attack where an adversary is using common tools in a way that's trying to avoid detection or establish persistence.\n\nIn summary, while some of these events individually might not be alarming, together they show a pattern of activity that's more concerning than normal user behavior. The repeated PowerShell executions, file operations, and registry modifications are red flags that could indicate malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with suspicious activities including file deletion, repeated script execution checks, and Registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in malicious activities. The command lines show some If statements checking file paths. For example, \"if (Test-Path C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat) {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This suggests the script is checking if a specific file exists and exiting based on that. Such behavior could be part of a larger payload to ensure certain components are present before executing malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there's a sequence where powershell.exe creates temporary files in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. For instance, __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. Temporary script creation followed by deletion is a common tactic to avoid detection because it leaves fewer traces.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET and Windows DLLs. While this isn't inherently malicious, combined with other activities, it could be part of obfuscating or executing code in memory.\n\nThen there are several Registry value sets by chrome.exe. This seems odd because Chrome typically doesn't make frequent registry changes unless through extensions or updates. Multiple writes might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\nAdditionally, the creation and deletion of files in different locations like Downloads and StartupProfileData might be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence points.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command lines, file operations in temporary directories, registry modifications by an unusual process (chrome.exe), and image loading activities. These patterns collectively indicate potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts that check for file existence, create temporary files which are then deleted, and load various DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each entry has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. \n\nStarting with the first few entries, I notice that the process is consistently 'powershell.exe'. That's already a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. The tasks in these logs include things like 'Registry value set', which could indicate attempts to modify system settings—something attackers might do to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking deeper, there are events where the task is 'Process Create' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. These relate to creating new processes and managing providers, which again aligns with potentially malicious activities since attackers often create new processes to execute their scripts. \n\nThe command lines in some of these events caught my attention. For example:\n```\n\"powershell.exe & {New-Item \\\"C:\\\\...\\\\..\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\componente_temporario_script.bat\\\" -Force | Out-Null\\\\nSet-Content -Path \\\\\\\"C:\\\\...\\\\..\\\\modulo_padrao\\\\unidade_base_script.bat\\\\\\\" -Value \\\\\\\"dir\\\\\\\"}\"\n```\nBreaking this down, it seems like the script is creating a new file in various directories and setting its content to 'dir'. This could be part of a script that's generating batch files. The fact that multiple events are doing similar operations across different paths suggests some level of automation or repeated behavior—possibly indicative of script execution, which could be malicious if it's trying to create persistent backdoors or spread across the system.\n\nThe files being created end with '_script.bat', which makes me think they might be scripts used by an attacker. Batch files can execute commands, and having multiple such files created in different locations could be part of a larger campaign to maintain access or perform malicious tasks.\n\nI also notice that some events don't have file paths but focus on registry changes and process creation without writing any files. This could mean the attack is multifaceted—some parts creating files for persistence, others modifying system configurations to hide traces or gain deeper access.\n\nAnother point is the presence of 'File created' tasks with specific paths. For example:\n```\n\"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"},\n\"winlog\": {\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\n\"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1\"}\n```\nThis file is a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, which is another common location for temporary files that might be deleted later or used to test certain policies. It could be related to checking script execution policies to bypass restrictions.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of using PowerShell to create multiple batch files in various directories and modifying system settings. This behavior isn't typical of normal user activity and aligns with tactics attackers use—like creating persistence points or deploying malicious scripts across the system. The repetition of similar commands and the locations targeted make this more concerning.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these could be legitimate administrative tasks, but given the volume and specific actions like registry modifications without corresponding reads, it's less likely. Moreover, the creation of multiple batch files with predictable naming conventions seems intentional rather than random.\n\nIn conclusion, while I can't confirm malicious intent 100%, the indicators are red flags that should be looked into further. This activity could indicate a breach or an ongoing attack, so it would be wise to investigate these events for any signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity, particularly involving the use of PowerShell to create files and modify system configurations. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Process Consistency:** All entries involve `powershell.exe`, a tool often exploited by attackers for scripting and command execution.\n\n2. **Task Types:**\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Tasks like 'Registry value set' suggest attempts to alter system settings, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n   - **Process Creation:** Events with 'Process Create' indicate new processes being spawned, which could be part of a malicious script's execution flow.\n\n3. **Command-Line Activities:**\n   - Scripts execute commands that create batch files (e.g., `New-Item` and `Set-Content`). The creation of multiple `_script.bat` files in various directories suggests automation or an attempt to spread across the system, which is often seen in attacks for persistence.\n   - Batch files set their content to 'dir', potentially indicating they are placeholders for further commands or part of a larger script deployment.\n\n4. **File Creation:**\n   - The creation of `.ps1` scripts in the Temp directory points towards testing execution policies or creating temporary backdoors, which is typical in attacks aimed at bypassing restrictions.\n\n5. **Patterns and Concerns:**\n   - Repetitive actions across different directories suggest a deliberate campaign rather than random activities.\n   - The combination of file creation, registry modifications, and process spawning aligns with attack tactics for persistence and lateral movement.\n\n**Conclusion:** These log entries demonstrate behaviors consistent with a potential cybersecurity incident. The activities involving `powershell.exe`, file creation, and system configuration changes are red flags that warrant further investigation to determine if a breach has occurred or is ongoing."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The first event shows that powershell.exe deleted a file, which could be suspicious if it's deleting something unexpected. But sometimes scripts do clean up their own files.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe creates new files. For example, one event shows the creation of \"elemento_comum_script.bat\". The command line in another event uses PowerShell to write a batch file and then exit based on whether it exists. This seems like it's setting up some scripts on the system.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious actors to maintain access or ensure their code runs at startup.\n\nThere are also a lot of ImageLoad events as powershell.exe loads various DLLs. While this is normal for PowerShell, the specific DLLs might be worth checking. For instance, MpClient.dll from Windows Defender—does that make sense in this context? It could be legitimate, but it's worth verifying if there's any anomaly here.\n\nThe command lines show some complex script executions. The use of Test-Path to check for existing files suggests the script is trying to avoid overwriting or maybe ensuring certain conditions are met before proceeding. This behavior can be part of fileless malware techniques or simply legitimate scripting, but it's something to monitor.\n\nI'm also noticing repeated patterns in the command lines across different events. The same script paths and checks seem to appear multiple times, which might indicate an attempt to write and execute scripts in various locations on the system. This could be a sign of lateral movement or attempting to establish persistence points across different directories.\n\nThe combination of file creation, registry changes, and repeated PowerShell executions makes me lean towards this being suspicious. While some activities could be part of legitimate administration or script execution, the volume and specific actions—like creating multiple batch files and checking their existence—raise red flags.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities align with known TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures) used by cyber attackers. For example, using PowerShell for command execution and persistence is a common technique in APTs and ransomware campaigns. The creation of multiple script files across different directories might be an attempt to spread out malicious scripts to avoid detection or deletion.\n\nFurthermore, the use of batch files generated by PowerShell could allow for remote execution or scheduling. If these files are being created without proper user knowledge or authorization, it's a sign of potential compromise.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not necessarily be malicious, the pattern of activity—repeated script creation, registry modifications, and multiple file deletions—points towards potentially harmful behavior. It would be prudent to investigate further, possibly looking into the exact scripts being created, checking for any anomalies in process trees, and ensuring that these activities are authorized.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits concerning activity indicative of potential malicious behavior. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Execution**: The consistent use of powershell.exe is notable, as it's a tool often exploited by attackers for scripting and execution.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: The creation of multiple .bat files and deletion of specific files suggests possible script setup or cleanup, which could be part of malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms or fileless malware.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Both powershell.exe and conhost.exe made registry changes, which can be used for persistence. This behavior aligns with tactics to maintain system access.\n\n4. **DLL Loading**: The loading of various DLLs, including MpClient.dll, could be part of legitimate operations but warrants scrutiny, especially if unexpected.\n\n5. **Script Patterns**: The command lines show repeated patterns in script execution and checks, possibly indicating attempts to establish multiple persistence points or lateral movement.\n\nGiven these factors, the activity appears suspicious, aligning with known attacker techniques like using PowerShell for command execution and creating scripts for persistence. Further investigation is recommended to validate if these actions are authorized or indicative of a breach."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst, there are several PowerShell.exe processes being executed with command lines that check if certain files exist. Each command line seems to be using the Test-Path cmdlet to verify the presence of specific .bat files in different directories. For example, \"C:\\\\modulo_geral\\\\estrutura_geral\\\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat\" and others like that. This pattern repeats multiple times with different file paths being checked.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell is loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. These are legitimate files, part of Microsoft's security software, so this doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I notice a file creation event by PowerShell.exe for a temporary .ps1 script: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1\". This script is created and then immediately deleted in the next event. Temporary scripts are common when running PowerShell commands that don't require persistence, so this might not raise flags unless there's something unusual about the script content.\n\nAnother file creation is by winlogbeat.exe for a .yml.new file, which seems related to log shipping or configuration, likely benign as it's part of the data collection process.\n\nThere are also registry value sets and process accesses by PowerShell.exe. These could be normal operations since PowerShell often interacts with the registry, but repeated access without clear purpose might warrant attention.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. This command is commonly used to check user permissions and can be part of legitimate scripts or malicious activities trying to gather information about the system.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, multiple instances of PowerShell checking for specific files might indicate a script that's verifying if certain tools or components are present on the system. If these files aren't meant to be there, it could suggest an attacker is probing the system to see what tools they can use. The creation and deletion of temporary scripts add some concern because bad actors often clean up their tracks by deleting files after execution.\n\nHowever, without seeing the actual content of those .ps1 scripts or knowing the exact purpose behind checking for these specific .bat files, it's hard to say definitively. It could be a script testing system configuration, part of a larger deployment process, or something malicious like checking if tools are present before deploying malware.\n\nThe use of legitimate processes and libraries might make this activity blend in, making detection harder. But the repetitive nature of checking multiple file paths using PowerShell could be a red flag for automated probing or lateral movement within a network.\n\nIn conclusion, while not all events look suspicious on their own, the combination suggests possible malicious behavior, especially if these files aren't expected to exist on the system or if this pattern repeats over time.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events involves multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands that check for specific .bat files, creating temporary scripts, interacting with system processes, and running whoami.exe. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **File Existence Checks:** PowerShell is repeatedly checking if certain .bat files exist in various directories using Test-Path. This could indicate an attempt to verify available tools or components on the system.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation\/Delete:** A temporary .ps1 script is created and then deleted. While common for non-persistent scripts, it raises a slight concern as malicious actors often clean their tracks.\n\n3. **Legitimate Library Loading:** PowerShell loads MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which are legitimate files, suggesting no immediate harm here.\n\n4. **File Creation by winlogbeat.exe:** A .yml.new file is created, likely related to log configuration, indicating benign activity.\n\n5. **Registry Interactions:** Registry value sets and process accesses might be normal for PowerShell but could warrant attention if not explained.\n\n6. **whoami.exe Execution:** This command could be part of legitimate system checks or malicious information gathering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile individual actions may appear benign, the repetitive nature of file checks and temporary script usage suggests possible probing or malicious activity. Without more context on the files' purposes, there's a reasonable concern for potential threat actor behavior.

There are multiple entries where the task is 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)' for powershell.exe. This seems normal because PowerShell is a common tool used by both admins and scripts. However, repeated accesses might indicate something fishy.\n\nThen there's an event with cmd.exe accessing the registry. That could be part of legitimate operations, but sometimes attackers use command-line tools to modify system settings, so it's worth noting.\n\nI see two instances where whoami.exe was executed. Whoami is typically used to get user information, which can be a precursor to more malicious activities like privilege escalation or lateral movement. But on its own, it might not be suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nThe interesting part comes in the later events. There are several PowerShell processes created with specific command lines. Each command line checks if a particular file path exists and exits with 0 if it does, else exits with 1. The paths mentioned (like C:\\modulo_secundario\\...) don't look like standard system files; they seem custom or related to some project structure.\n\nThis pattern suggests that the script is checking for the existence of certain files across different directories. If these files are part of malicious payloads or indicators, this could be a way for attackers to verify if their tools are present before proceeding with more harmful actions.\n\nMoreover, the repetitive nature of these checks might indicate an attempt to ensure persistence or deployment of malicious code. The use of multiple paths and the structure of the command lines seem tailored, possibly as part of a larger script or payload delivery mechanism.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level. While individual events could be benign, the combination—especially the repeated PowerShell executions with specific checks—points towards potential malicious activity. This gives me a high confidence that this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing various files and registry values, along with repeated checks for specific file paths which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. The process name is consistently powershell.exe across many entries. This could be normal, but sometimes malicious activities use PowerShell because it's legitimate and can execute commands.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field: there are Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, Engine Lifecycle, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create events. These seem related to how PowerShell is being used or monitored.\n\nThe files mentioned include MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which are legitimate system files. There's also a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1 created and then deleted, which might be part of testing script policies but could indicate something more if the name seems suspicious.\n\nMultiple events show exit codes based on whether specific files exist (like elemento_base.cs or Get-Keystrokes.ps1). This pattern suggests some form of file checking or possibly a persistence mechanism where scripts are checking for certain files to decide their behavior.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process created, which is often used to get system information. However, in this context, it's not immediately concerning unless combined with other actions.\n\nThe repeated command lines in the process events all check for different paths to Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition could indicate an attempt to see if that script exists or is accessible. Keystroke logging scripts are often malicious as they can capture sensitive information.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry value set tasks. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or to hide processes, which raises a red flag for potential malware activities.\n\nConsidering all these together: PowerShell being used extensively with checks for specific files, deletions, and registry changes along with attempts to execute Get-Keystrokes.ps1 (a known script for keystroke logging) suggests malicious intent. The repeated checking of different paths might be an attempt to locate and execute the script from various locations, possibly evading detection.\n\nWhile some actions could be legitimate system administration tasks, the combination of file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated checks for a suspicious script makes this batch of events stand out as potentially malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity**: The events show extensive use of powershell.exe, which is commonly used by both legitimate scripts and malicious actors to execute commands.\n\n2. **Analyze Task Types**: Tasks include loading images, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and process access\/create events, indicating potential system-level activities that could be malicious.\n\n3. **File Operations**: Creation and deletion of a PowerShell test script (__PSScriptPolicyTest...) might be testing or attempting to remove traces, while checking for the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests an attempt to run known malicious scripts.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Setting registry values can help in persistence mechanisms, making it suspicious when combined with other activities.\n\n5. **Repetitive File Checks**: Multiple checks for different paths to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 indicate a pattern that could be trying to locate and execute this script across various locations, possibly evading detection or accessing it from multiple sources.\n\n6. **Combine Indicators**: The convergence of file deletions, registry changes, and repeated attempts to access known malicious scripts creates a strong suspicion of malicious activity aimed at persistence, data theft, or system compromise.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activities including file deletion,registry modifications,and multiple checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1,a script often used for keystroke logging.Indicators suggest potential malicious intent.\",\n  \"severity_level\": \"high\",\n  \"recommended_action\": \"Investigate further into the processes and scripts involved.Consider isolating affected systems and performing a full security audit.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. I'm given a batch of JSONL events that log various system activities. My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first few events are all related to powershell.exe accessing or loading images. They're loading mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are common .NET framework components that PowerShell would typically use when executing scripts. So these seem normal.\n\n2. There's an event where a file is created in the Temporary folder named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Then immediately after, it deletes the same file. This looks suspicious because creating and then deleting a PowerShell script could be a way to avoid detection or persistence.\n\n3. Next, there are events related to powershell.exe's command line arguments checking for specific script paths (Get-Keystrokes.ps1). The paths mentioned change slightly in each event, which might indicate multiple attempts or different locations being checked. Get-Keystrokes sounds like it would capture keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity.\n\n4. Then there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That seems benign as winlogbeat is likely a log collection tool.\n\n5. Another PowerShell event creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This could be related to persistence mechanisms since startup folders are often used for persistence.\n\n6. There are registry value sets by both powershell.exe and notepad.exe, which might indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. Not sure if that's malicious on its own but combined with other events, it raises a flag.\n\n7. whoami.exe is run, which is a standard tool for users to check their permissions. Doesn't seem suspicious unless used in a larger context.\n\n8. calc.exe and Calculator.exe both load urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows component for URL handling. Not concerning on its own.\n\n9. svchost.exe setting registry values—svchost is often used by malware but not always. Without more context, it's hard to say, but combined with other events, it adds up.\n\nPutting all this together: The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes checking for and potentially executing scripts (Get-Keystrokes), creating temporary files which are then deleted, and modifying the registry. These activities could be signs of a malicious script trying to establish persistence or perform actions like keylogging.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because of the combination of file creation\/deletion, multiple attempts to execute a potentially malicious script (Get-Keystrokes), and use of system tools in ways that could indicate unauthorized access. The registry modifications by different processes also add to the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is classified as **interesting** due to several concerning activities:\n\n1. **Suspicious File Operations**: PowerShell creates and deletes a temporary script file, which may indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n2. **Potentially Malicious Script Execution**: Multiple attempts to check for or execute `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, a script possibly used for malicious purposes like keylogging.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Registry changes by various processes could be signs of persistence or system tampering.\n\n4. **Use of System Tools**: Use of `whoami.exe` and multiple registry accesses might suggest unauthorized activities.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these events raises concerns about potential malicious activity, making the batch interesting from a cybersecurity perspective."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: It's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory with a .winlogbeat.yml.new extension. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely setting up its configuration, so no red flags there.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe accessing something. Powershell can be malicious, but it's also commonly used for legitimate tasks. The task is ProcessAccess, which could mean it's querying another process' info. Not sure yet if that's bad.\n\nThen whoami.exe runs with the command line pointing to system32. That's a standard system directory, so it's normal. It's just getting user information, nothing suspicious.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access event. Again, not unusual on its own.\n\nChrome is next; it's detecting network connections and DNS queries. Chrome does this all the time for browsing, so no issue here.\n\nsvchost.exe also has network connection events. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services, so that's normal too.\n\nLooking through more chrome.exe events, they're all about network connections or DNS lookups. That's standard behavior for a browser.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe again with some specific command lines. The command line shows \"& {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}\". Hmm, that looks like it's running some PowerShell commands to list items recursively. This could be part of normal script execution, but it's a bit concerning because it's using multiple ways to get directory listings, which might indicate lateral movement or data gathering.\n\nAlso, there are registry value sets by powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so this is something to note. Malware often uses the registry to maintain its presence between reboots.\n\nFinally, several image load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so that's normal. But combined with the other actions, it might be worth looking into if these loads are part of a malicious process.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, modifying the registry, and running commands that could gather information or establish persistence. While individual events aren't suspicious, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. So I'd classify this batch as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell.exe events involving registry modifications and commands that could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The first event shows the creation of a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1 in the Temp directory. This naming seems suspicious because script policy test files are often used by attackers to bypass certain restrictions, and having it created temporarily could indicate an attempt at execution.\n\nNext, there's a deletion event for that same file shortly after it was created. Malicious scripts sometimes delete their traces to avoid detection, which raises my concern. It suggests someone is trying to hide their activities on the system.\n\nLooking further, several events show powershell.exe running commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These are directory listing commands that recursively search through files. If these are part of a script, they could be used to gather information about the system, possibly for reconnaissance or data exfiltration.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from a Windows Defender Platform directory. Legitimate processes can load DLLs, but sometimes attackers use such modules to hide their activities or inject malicious code. It's worth checking if this loading is expected in normal operations.\n\nOther events involve file creations by winlogbeat.exe and conhost.exe accessing the registry. While these could be part of legitimate logging or system processes, the combination with powershell.exe activity makes me cautious. The creation of 'estrutura_secundario.txt' might be a secondary structure for storing data, potentially malicious in nature.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe interacts with the registry and other files without clear justification. This could indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms being set up, which are common signs of malware.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows repeated suspicious activities involving powershell.exe: creating and deleting a script file, running directory listings, potentially malicious DLL loading, and unauthorized file creations and registry accesses. These behaviors collectively point towards potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe show suspicious activity including file creation\/deletion of a script file, directory listings, and potential DLL injection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
