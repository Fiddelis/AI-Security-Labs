{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.54.exe created a file. That seems normal because Edge updates might create temporary files during setup. The next event is about changing the creation time of that same file, which could be part of the update process too.\n\nThen there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading MpOAV.dll. That sounds legitimate since it's related to Windows Defender. Next, setup.exe creates a pipe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, so this isn't unusual on its own.\n\nServices.exe logging on and then special logon events follow. Services and system processes often trigger these kinds of logs when starting up. There are multiple User Account Management tasks logged—probably just the system managing user sessions or permissions, which is standard.\n\nLooking at taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll makes sense because Task Scheduler relies on that DLL. Svchost.exe setting registry values is normal as it's a common service host process for various services.\n\nThe interesting part comes with powershell.exe being executed with some command line arguments. The command seems to be checking for specific .inf files in the Windows directory, looking for patterns related to installation configurations. This could indicate script execution, but the fact that it's using Get-Item and Get-Content is standard for PowerShell scripts. However, the presence of ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted might mean it's part of a controlled environment.\n\nAnother svchost.exe process creates a file in a non-standard location: C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local... That path looks unusual because system profile data shouldn't be in that directory. Typically, user profiles are under Users or ProgramData, but this is deeper into the system directories. This might suggest that a process with elevated privileges is writing there, which could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file. That's likely part of log management and shouldn't raise flags unless it's accessing restricted areas or behaving abnormally.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch has normal system activities like updates, service logs, process creations, and script executions. However, the powershell.exe command checking for .inf files with a specific regex could be trying to detect installed software or vulnerabilities, which might be part of reconnaissance before an attack. Also, the file created by svchost.exe in a non-standard path is concerning because it's unexpected behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there are elements that stand out but they aren't clearly malicious. They could be legitimate system operations or early signs of something more serious. I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because some events might indicate potential issues, even if not confirmed yet.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: Interesting**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe batch contains several normal system activities such as updates and process creations. However, the execution of a PowerShell script checking for specific .inf files could be indicative of reconnaissance or malicious activity. Additionally, an unusual file creation by svchost.exe in a non-standard location raises suspicion. These factors make the batch worth monitoring but not definitively malicious.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Normal Activities:** Includes updates and legitimate processes.\n- **Suspicious Indicators:** PowerShell script execution and unexpected file creation.\n- **Conclusion:** Potentially concerning behavior, classified as interesting for further investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint or not. \n\nFirst, I see several entries where processes are loading images or creating files. For example, MsMpEng.exe and CompatTelRunner.exe are loading taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows process related to task scheduling. Then there's svchost.exe creating some files in the Delivery Optimization directory—that’s also normal because svchost is part of various Windows services.\n\nLooking further, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is involved in file creation and deletion. This seems typical for an update mechanism. Edge updates often create temporary files during download and then delete them once installed or if they fail. The mention of a specific Edge version (135.0.3179.73) doesn't raise any red flags immediately.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe is appearing multiple times, both loading images and creating files. This process is part of Windows Defender, so its activity is expected. There's also some file locking happening with a .lock extension, which is normal for ensuring processes don't interfere with each other.\n\nThe user is interacting with git.exe, creating files in their Downloads directory under a course named \"Qualidade de Software.\" The paths are typical for development work, especially node_modules and semver functions. This looks like legitimate file operations during software development or scripting.\n\nSome entries mention registry value sets from conhost.exe and mintty.exe. These are standard system processes; conhost is part of Windows Subsystem for Linux, and mintty is a terminal emulator often used in such environments. Registry changes here aren't unusual unless they're modifying sensitive areas, but nothing indicates that's the case.\n\nThere's also an entry where MicrosoftEdgeUpdate deletes a file from the Temp directory. Temporary files are often cleaned up after use, so this isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity like repeated failed logins, access to restricted directories, or unusual process behaviors. All processes and file operations align with normal user activities—system updates, antivirus scans, and development work.\n\nThe only thing that stands out slightly is the number of events, but that's expected when dealing with multiple applications performing routine tasks. No single event or pattern suggests foul play.\n\nIn conclusion, these logs don't indicate any cybersecurity issues. They're all within normal operational parameters for a user system engaged in typical activities like web browsing, software development, and antivirus operations.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe provided log entries are from various legitimate processes on a Windows system. These include:\n\n1. **Windows Defender (MpCmdRun.exe):** Loading DLLs and creating temporary files, which is normal for antivirus operations.\n\n2. **Microsoft Edge Update:** Creating and deleting files during the update process, typical behavior for software updates.\n\n3. **svchost.exe:** Creating files in the Delivery Optimization directory, a standard Windows service activity.\n\n4. **Git-related activities:** File creations under `node_modules\/semver`, indicative of software development or scripting tasks.\n\n5. **Conhost.exe and Mintty.exe:** Registry modifications related to subsystems like WSL or terminal emulators, which are standard for such environments.\n\n6. **Temporary file deletion by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:** Cleaning up temporary files post-update is normal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNo signs of malicious activity are present in these logs. All observed processes and actions are consistent with normal system operations, including software updates, antivirus scans, and development activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. \n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures but are spread across different lines. The process name is \"git.exe\" every time, which immediately makes me think it's related to Git, a version control system. That's pretty common in development environments.\n\nThe winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so each event is about a file being created. That doesn't seem unusual on its own; creating files is something that happens all the time when working with code or any application.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, they're all located in \"C:\\Users\\...node_modules\\semver\\\" and then various function files like compare-loose.js, compare.js, diff.js, etc. Node modules are part of JavaScript packages used in Node.js applications, so semver is a specific module related to semantic versioning.\n\nGiven that the events are all file creations under node_modules\/semver, it looks like Git is cloning or updating this repository. Node modules being created could be during an npm install operation, which is standard when setting up a project or adding dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The files are typical for a semver package, and the process (git.exe) is creating them as part of version control operations. There's no indication of unexpected behavior, such as file deletion, access to restricted areas, or creation of hidden files.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem like normal development activities rather than anything suspicious. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there are no red flags indicating malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating files in a node_modules directory during normal package setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is a file creation in different paths under the same directory. The files created are various JavaScript and configuration files related to the 'semver' package.\n\nFirst, I consider whether these activities are normal for git operations. Git often clones repositories which include node_modules, so creating multiple files there isn't unusual. These events seem like part of a standard checkout or clone process.\n\nI check if there's any indication of malicious behavior, such as access to sensitive files or unexpected locations. All paths are within the expected 'node_modules' directory, and none seem suspicious.\n\nSince all events are consistent with normal git operations during a project setup, I don't see any red flags that would require investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation by the 'git.exe' process in a typical node_modules directory during development.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events that a user provided. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The task is to analyze all these events together and determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that every single event has the same process name: \"git.exe\". That immediately makes me think of Git, which is a version control system used for software development. So, the user is probably working on some codebase using Git.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field in each event, they all mention \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that each entry represents a file creation event. The files being created are located in various paths under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\\". \n\nThe paths point to specific node_modules and other files like package.json, README.md, LICENSE, etc. Node_modules is a directory that's part of the Node.js ecosystem for JavaScript projects, containing dependencies and modules used by a project. The presence of multiple .js files, package.json, and other standard project files suggests that this is related to setting up or updating a Node.js project.\n\nThe names of the modules like 'semver', 'serialize-javascript', 'set-blocking', and 'set-function-length' are all npm packages. This makes sense because when you install dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager), Git might be involved in tracking these changes, especially if someone is setting up a new project or updating existing ones.\n\nNow, considering the timestamps (even though they aren't provided here), it's possible that these events occurred during an initial setup of a project. The user might have cloned a repository and run 'npm install' to install all dependencies, which would create all these files in the node_modules directory.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's anything unusual about this activity. Since all the events are related to file creation by Git, and they're typical when setting up or working on a Node.js project, it doesn't seem suspicious. There's no indication of any malicious behavior like multiple failed login attempts, access to restricted files, or other red flags.\n\nHowever, I should consider if such activity could be part of an attack vector. For example, sometimes attackers might use Git to exfiltrate data or inject malicious code into repositories. But in this case, all the created files are standard for a Node.js project setup, and there's no evidence of any unauthorized access or unusual file names.\n\nThe number of events is also something to note. There are multiple entries, but they're all part of the same process (Git) creating related files in a predictable pattern. This doesn't trigger any alarms for me because it aligns with normal development activities.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether these logs could be from a legitimate activity or if someone is trying to hide something by using Git as a cover. However, without seeing anything out of the ordinary in the file paths or names, I can't find any reason to suspect malicious intent here.\n\nIn summary, each log entry represents a normal part of setting up a Node.js project using Git and npm. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data breaches, or other cybersecurity issues. Therefore, this batch of logs doesn't seem interesting from a security investigation standpoint unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events does not indicate any malicious activity. All entries are related to the creation of files during the setup of a Node.js project using Git and npm. This is typical for development environments and does not raise any security concerns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"All events relate to normal file creation activities associated with setting up or managing a Node.js project using Git. There are no signs of unauthorized access, suspicious files, or malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by looking at the data provided.\n\nEach line in the JSONL file represents an event with three main components: process info, a windows log task description, and file details. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which suggests that Git is being used here. The task in each case is \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". The files being created are located in paths like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" followed by various package names and their internal files.\n\nSo, looking at this, I notice that all these file creation events are happening under the node_modules directory. Node modules are where JavaScript packages are stored when you install them using npm (Node Package Manager). Git is often used in development environments to manage code repositories, so it's common for developers to clone repositories that include node_modules.\n\nI should consider whether creating files within node_modules is a normal behavior. In software development, especially with Node.js projects, installing dependencies with npm will automatically create these directories and files. So if someone is working on a project, running `npm install` would result in the creation of multiple files within node_modules as each package is extracted and stored.\n\nLooking at the specific files being created: there are package.json files, index.js, .d.ts (TypeScript definition), licenses, README.md, etc. These are all standard files that you'd expect to find in a typical npm package structure. For example, \"set-function-length\" and \"shebang-command\" sound like npm packages. Even the presence of .editorconfig and .eslintrc suggests this is related to code formatting and linting configurations, which are part of normal development workflows.\n\nAnother thing to note is that all these events are generated by the same process, git.exe. This might seem a bit odd because Git isn't usually responsible for creating files in node_modules. However, if someone is cloning a repository that includes a full history, including historical installs of dependencies, it's possible that Git could be checking out or restoring those files as part of the clone process. Alternatively, perhaps during a large operation like a rebase or merge, some activity within the project structure might trigger these file creations.\n\nI should also think about whether there are any red flags here. The paths don't seem suspicious; they're all standard locations for development packages. There's no indication of unusual filenames or attempts to access restricted areas. The user in the path is \"fiddelis\", which doesn't raise any alarms unless I have prior knowledge that this user is not supposed to be accessing certain resources, but there's no evidence here.\n\nConsidering the frequency and volume of events, there are 18 file creation events listed. While that might seem like a lot, it's possible in a development environment where multiple packages are being installed or checked out at once. Each npm install could generate several such events depending on how many files each package has.\n\nI should also think about the context in which these events occurred. If this is happening within an isolated environment or during a known development activity (like setting up a project), then it's entirely normal. However, if these events are occurring outside of expected usage patterns, especially in a production environment, it might warrant further investigation. But based on the information given, there's no context suggesting misuse.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IOC), none seem to be present here. The files being created are standard for npm packages, and there's no sign of any malicious scripts or file names that could indicate an attack. There's also no evidence of unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts in the logs provided.\n\nAnother angle is to consider whether Git itself was used in a way that's beyond normal operations. For instance, if someone were using Git to download or execute code from untrusted sources, but again, the file paths and actions don't suggest any such activity. It seems purely related to project files and dependencies.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of log spoofing or events being injected by malicious software. While that's a concern in cybersecurity, without additional context or evidence, it's hard to justify deep investigation based solely on these logs. The events appear consistent with legitimate activities.\n\nIn summary, the events show normal file creation activity within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development when dependencies are being installed or when a repository is cloned with a full history. There's no indication of malicious behavior, so unless there's more context suggesting otherwise, these events aren't particularly concerning for cybersecurity purposes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events does not indicate any suspicious activity and can be considered normal within a software development context.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Analysis:** All events are initiated by `git.exe`, which is commonly used in development environments to manage code repositories.\n\n2. **File Creation Context:** The files being created are under the `node_modules` directory, indicating npm package installations or repository checks.\n\n3. **Standard File Types:** The files include package.json, index.js, and documentation files, all typical for npm packages.\n\n4. **No Red Flags:** No suspicious filenames or paths are present; all activities align with expected development workflows.\n\n5. **Volume of Events:** While numerous, the count is reasonable during a project setup or repository clone, especially with multiple dependencies.\n\n6. **Lack of Indicators of Compromise:** No IOC signs like malicious scripts or unauthorized access attempts are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events represent normal file creation activities related to npm package installations or Git repository operations. There's no evidence of malicious behavior, making them non-concerning for cybersecurity purposes."}

It seems like all these events are similar. They all have a process named \"git.exe\". The log type is \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\", which makes me think it's part of file system monitoring. The file paths are pointing to various locations under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" followed by different package names like strip-json-comments, supports-color, tcomb-validation, and tcomb.\n\nHmm, so each event is a file creation by git.exe.

When someone clones a repository or installs node modules, Git might create these files as part of the setup process. The paths like \"node_modules\" suggest this is related to Node.js projects, where dependencies are stored.\n\nLooking at all the events together, I see multiple files being created under different subdirectories within node_modules.

No signs of malicious activities like failed login attempts, access to restricted files, or creation of unexpected executables. All the file paths are standard for a Node.js development environment. The process is git.exe, which isn't typically associated with malware, but it's commonly used in development.\n\nThe frequency of these events might be high when someone is setting up multiple dependencies or initializing projects.

The winlog task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so it's about file creation events. The file paths are various files under C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib, like Any.js, Array.js, Boolean.js, etc.\n\nFirst, I know that node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js projects where third-party libraries are stored.

There's no indication of unusual file names, access patterns, or activities that would suggest an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, while these events are part of normal system operations during software development, they don't raise any red flags. They’re just Git creating files as part of the module setup process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during software development and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each event is a JSON object with some details about file creation. The process name in each case is \"git.exe\", which makes me think it's related to Git operations since that's a common tool for version control.\n\nThe task field says it's a file created event, triggered by the rule \"FileCreate\". So, these are all notifications of new files being made on the system. The file paths point to various locations within \"C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\", and each file has a different name like isNil.js, isNumber.js, etc. \n\nI know that node_modules is a directory where Node.js packages are stored. Git might be cloning or updating repositories, which would involve creating files in such directories. This seems normal if the user is working on a project using Git and Node.js.\n\nSince all events are from the same process (git.exe) and involve standard file creation during what appears to be a development workflow, there's no indication of malicious activity. No unusual paths or filenames jump out as suspicious. It doesn't look like any system files or restricted areas are being accessed.\n\nTherefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation because it aligns with expected behavior from legitimate software operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development activities.
