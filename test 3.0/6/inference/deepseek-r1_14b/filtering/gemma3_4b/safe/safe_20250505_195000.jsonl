{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from processes like SDXHelper.exe and taskhostw.exe loading system files such as combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These seem normal because these are common Windows system files being loaded by legitimate processes.\n\nNext, I notice services.exe logging a logon event and another event with \"Special Logon\". That could be related to user activity or service accounts, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's suspicious.\n\nThen there are several DNS query events from SDXHelper.exe. While frequent DNS lookups can sometimes indicate malicious activity like domain generation algorithms (DGAs), in this case, the queries don't seem to point to known bad domains. They might just be part of legitimate operations or monitoring.\n\nThe powershell.exe entries caught my attention. There are ImageLoad events for various DLLs which is normal when PowerShell starts up. But there's also a file created and then deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1 in the Temp directory. Creating and immediately deleting a script file could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace, which might indicate malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are Pipe Created events from powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but their usage in this context isn't clearly malicious without more details.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, while some activities like ImageLoad and DNS queries could be normal, the combination of creating and deleting a PowerShell script file might raise concerns. This behavior is often associated with attempts to execute scripts stealthily, possibly indicating an attack or unauthorized access attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows potentially suspicious activities such as multiple DNS queries and file operations involving PowerShell that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle.\" PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so repeated executions could be a red flag. However, in this case, these seem to be standard lifecycle events, which might not indicate anything suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, there's an event involving HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. I'm not immediately familiar with what HxTsr.exe does, but registry modifications can be part of normal operations or potentially malicious activities like persistence mechanisms. This one could warrant closer look, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are several entries related to Python processesâ€”py.exe and python.exe. These involve image loads and process creations. Python is a common tool for scripting and development, so seeing these events might just be normal user activity. However, if the command lines or file paths seem unusual, that could raise concerns. Looking at the command line in one of them: it's pointing to the Python Launcher, which seems standard.\n\nAnother event involves winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack for log management, so this is probably a legitimate process and not indicative of malicious behavior unless there are anomalies in file paths or permissions.\n\nThere are also multiple DnsQuery events from SDXHelper.exe. DNS queries alone aren't suspicious, but repeated or unusual queries could indicate data exfiltration or domain generation algorithms used by malware. Again, without seeing the specific domains queried, it's hard to assess risk here.\n\nLastly, RuntimeBroker.exe modifying registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows and handles runtime events; its normal operation includes registry interactions, so this event might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together, while there are several processes that could raise flags individually, the combination doesn't show a clear pattern of malicious activity. The repeated powershell.exe entries could be concerning, but without evidence of command-line arguments or writes to files, it's hard to classify them as malicious. Similarly, the Python and winlogbeat activities seem within normal user operations. The DnsQuery events are frequent but lack specific context about the queried domains.\n\nOverall, while there are some points that might need closer monitoring, the batch doesn't present a definitive indication of malicious behavior when considered as a whole. Therefore, I would classify this batch as not interesting for further investigation at this stage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of normal system processes and activities, such as PowerShell lifecycle events, Python process creations, and legitimate file operations. While some events could be points of interest individually, the overall batch does not indicate malicious behavior when considered together.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
