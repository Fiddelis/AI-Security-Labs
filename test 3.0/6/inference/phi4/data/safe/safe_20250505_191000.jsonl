SDXHelper.exe is not a standard Windows process, raising suspicion.\n\n- **rundll32.exe with Embedding**: The use of rundll32.exe to embed a COM server (SHCreateLocalServerRunDll) is notable because this can be exploited for persistence and unauthorized execution of DLLs, suggesting potential abuse.\n\n- **EXCEL.EXE**: Although Excel itself is legitimate, the loading of multiple system DLLs (`combase.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, etc.) could indicate it's being leveraged in a process injection or other advanced persistent threat (APT) techniques. The DNS query associated with EXCEL.EXE further supports this suspicion.\n\n- **System Integrity**: Frequent registry modifications by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, along with user account management operations, may point to attempts at system compromise or configuration changes post-exploitation.\n\nThese patterns collectively suggest that the batch of events warrants further investigation for potential malicious activity. The confidence level reflects the combination of unusual behaviors and known exploitation techniques, but not absolute certainty due to possible benign scenarios."}
