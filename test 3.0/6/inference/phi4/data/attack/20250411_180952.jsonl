Additionally, there are DNS queries and network connections from non-standard processes like `net1.exe`. These activities suggest an attempt to modify system settings and create accounts with elevated privileges, which is typically associated with compromise attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
