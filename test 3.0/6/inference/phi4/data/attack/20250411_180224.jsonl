There is also evidence of scheduled tasks (`schtasks`) being created and queried in a manner consistent with persistence mechanisms used by malware. The repeated registry modification events by different processes, such as `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`, could indicate attempts to alter system configurations or maintain persistence. Additionally, the creation of files related to monitoring tools like Winlogbeat in unusual locations suggests possible reconnaissance activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
