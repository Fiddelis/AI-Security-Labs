{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicating potentially malicious behavior, including file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and image loading.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**: The batch contains numerous entries related to `powershell.exe`, which is often used by attackers for executing scripts due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: There are several events indicating registry value changes (`RegistryEvent`). This can be a sign of malicious software trying to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **File Operations**: The batch includes file creation and deletion events involving `powershell.exe`. Creating temporary files and then deleting them is a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving obvious traces.\n\n4. **Image Loading**: Multiple entries show image loading activities related to legitimate Windows components (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) but also include `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender. This could indicate attempts to load malicious payloads or disable security features.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**: The event of a pipe being created by `powershell.exe` can be indicative of inter-process communication used in sophisticated attacks.\n\n6. **Consistent Patterns**: The repeated pattern of the command line `powershell.exe & {Get-Date}` suggests automation, which could be part of an attacker's script to gather information or maintain persistence.\n\nOverall, the combination of these activities across multiple events raises a strong suspicion of malicious behavior warranting further investigation. The confidence level is set at 0.85 due to the clear patterns and potential indicators of compromise present in the logs."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes interacting with system registry and accessing other processes raise suspicion of potentially malicious activity, especially when combined with the creation of configuration files by a monitoring tool.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\nThis classification is based on the observed behavior: frequent use of `powershell.exe` to set registry values and access other processes can be indicative of automated scripts or command execution often associated with malicious activities like privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the creation of a `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file by `winlogbeat.exe`, which is typically used for log collection, could suggest configuration changes related to logging, possibly indicating an attempt at obfuscation or tampering with monitoring tools. The combination of these events warrants further investigation due to their potential implications in a security context."}
