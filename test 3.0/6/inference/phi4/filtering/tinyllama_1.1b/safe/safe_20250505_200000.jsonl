Additionally, the repeated loading of 'urlmon.dll' by different processes ('WindowsCamera.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', and 'SDXHelper.exe') is suspicious because this DLL is associated with URL moniker objects, often exploited in malicious activities. The combination of registry manipulations and suspicious DLL loads warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
