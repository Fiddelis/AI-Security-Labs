This includes the use of `certutil.exe` for encoding and decoding operations, which is often used to obfuscate payloads. The repeated use of `chrome.exe` for registry modifications and network connections could indicate it being leveraged as a persistence mechanism or for exfiltration. Additionally, the presence of `SDXHelper.exe` loading an image from a system directory raises concerns about potential DLL hijacking.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
