The presence of encoded\/decoded executables (calc.exe) being manipulated on disk further suggests malicious behavior. Additionally, repeated registry value modifications by chrome.exe may indicate attempts at persistence or configuration changes. Powershell activities and the execution of uncommon processes like SDXHelper.exe raise concerns about potential script-based attacks or unauthorized software installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
