{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This output appears to be a log file from an event monitoring system, likely Windows Event Log or Winlogbeat. It contains information about various events that occurred on the system, including process creations, terminations, accesses, and network connections.\n\nHere are some key insights that can be gathered from this data:\n\n1. **Process Activity**: The log shows a sequence of processes being created, accessed, terminated, and communicating over the network. This indicates active system usage.\n2. **Updates and Downloads**: There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running, which could indicate an ongoing update or patch process for Microsoft Edge browser.\n3. **Networking Activity**: Several events involving `Network connection detected` suggest that some processes are communicating with remote servers over the network.\n4. **File System Access**: Some processes are accessing various files on the system, such as log files created by Winlogbeat (`winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`).\n5. **User and System Activities**: The presence of `powershell.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` indicates that user and system activities are being logged.\n\nTo further analyze this data:\n\n1. **Filtering and Aggregation**: Filter the events by specific processes, users, or time ranges to understand which activities occurred more frequently.\n2. **Event Correlation**: Look for related events that occurred in close proximity to each other (e.g., process creation followed by access).\n3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Investigate unusual patterns of behavior, such as sudden increases in network connections or file system accesses.\n\nPlease note that the interpretation of this data depends on your specific requirements and use case. This analysis is a starting point for identifying potential security threats, but further investigation may be necessary to determine the cause and impact of these events."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from Winlogbeat, an open-source data shipper for Windows systems. It contains logs of various events that occurred on the system, including process creations, registry value changes, DNS queries, and more.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the different types of events:\n\n1. **Process Create**: These events indicate when a new process is created on the system.\n\t* Examples: `{\"process\":{\"name\":\"notepad.exe\",\"command_line\":\"\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\notepad.exe\\\" \"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\"file\":null}`\n2. **Registry Value Set**: These events indicate when a registry value is changed on the system.\n\t* Example: `{\"process\":{\"name\":\"Explorer.EXE\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":null}`\n3. **File Created**: These events indicate when a new file is created on the system.\n\t* Examples: `{\"process\":{\"name\":\"svchost.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\ServiceProfiles\\\\NetworkService\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\DeliveryOptimization\\\\Cache\\\\0119e1000c0b37d7bf0cbfcf99429ea7a6b906fb\"}}`\n4. **DNS Query**: These events indicate when a DNS query is made on the system.\n\t* Example: `{\"process\":{\"name\":\"CompatTelRunner.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\"},\"file\":null}`\n5. **File Delete Logged**: These events indicate when a file delete operation is logged on the system.\n\t* Example: `{\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"}}`\n6. **File Creation Time Changed**: These events indicate when the creation time of a file is changed on the system.\n\t* Example: `{\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File creation time changed (rule: FileCreateTime)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft\\\\EdgeUpdate\\\\Install\\\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\\\setup.exe\"}}`\n\nThese events can provide valuable insights into system activity and potential security threats."}
