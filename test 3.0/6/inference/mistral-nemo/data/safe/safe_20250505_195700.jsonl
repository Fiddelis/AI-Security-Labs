{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON-like data, I've created a summary of the events. These events seem to be related to file creation activities by a process named \"Solitaire.exe\".\n\n- **Process Involved**: Solitaire.exe\n- **Events (n=18)**:\n  - **File Creation Events (n=17)**: The process created various files with paths starting from `\"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\cache\\dlfiles\\globaldata\\\"`. These files are likely assets or resources used by the Solitaire game. The file extensions observed include `.js`, `.archive`, and no extension (interpreted as folders).\n  - **DNS Query Event (n=1)**: There's one event where the task is a DNS query (`\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"`).\n\nGiven that all events involve the creation of files by \"Solitaire.exe\", it suggests that these events are likely normal behavior for the Microsoft Solitaire Collection game. However, without additional context or logs from other sources, it's difficult to definitively determine if any of these activities are malicious or anomalous.\n\nHere's a simple breakdown:\n\n| Event Type | Count |\n| --- | --- |\n| File Creation | 17 |\n| DNS Query | 1 |\n\nIf you're concerned about the security of your system, you might want to investigate further or consult with a cybersecurity professional."}

The files created and accessed are located in typical user data directories, not system or program files folders. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **File Creation Events (97% of the logs):** These are all related to Microsoft Solitaire creating, updating, or accessing files in its cache directory. This is expected behavior for an application that downloads and updates game assets.\n\n2. **Dns Query Event (3% of the logs):** This event is normal for any application that needs to communicate over a network. It's not indicative of malicious activity unless it's followed by other suspicious events or there's excessive query frequency.\n\n**No notable anomalies or indicators of compromise were found in this dataset.**"}
