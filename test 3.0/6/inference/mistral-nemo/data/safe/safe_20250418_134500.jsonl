{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a summary of what happened:\n\n1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process creation and activity:**\n   - Microsoft Edge Update service (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) was started.\n   - It accessed several files from its installation directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate`):\n     - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`\n     - `msedgeupdate.dll`\n     - Other DLLs and executables under the `1.3.195.49` folder\n   - It made network connections, possibly to download updates.\n   - After completing its tasks, it terminated three times consecutively.\n\n2. **RuntimeBroker.exe registry value set:**\n   - The Runtime Broker (`RuntimeBroker.exe`) process set a new value in the registry.\n\n3. **winlogbeat.exe process creation and activity:**\n   - winlogbeat (`winlogbeat.exe`), a log shipping agent for the Elastic Stack, was started from its download directory.\n   - It created a new `.ndjson` log file in its `logs` folder (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs`).\n\n4. **powershell.exe process accessed:**\n   - There was an access attempt to the PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`), but no further context is provided in these logs.\n\nThere's nothing immediately alarming in these logs, as they mostly depict normal Windows event log entries for system processes and services doing their usual operations. However, always consider monitoring these activities closely if they're out of the ordinary or frequent in your specific environment to detect any potential security threats.\n\nTo analyze these events more effectively, you might want to look into related events (e.g., before\/after these timestamps) or enable additional logging for more context on certain processes and their behavior."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the events that occurred on the system:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**\n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` created and deleted temporary files in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`.\n   - It downloaded an update for Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`) and created a new temporary file (`setup.exe`) in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install`.\n   - It then created an anonymous pipe.\n\n2. **Notepad Process:**\n   - Notepad was opened from the command line without any specified file path.\n\n3. **Other Processes and Events:**\n   - `svchost.exe` created files in `C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\Cache`.\n   - Explorer modified a registry value.\n   - CompatTelRunner performed a DNS query.\n   - Winlogbeat (a log shipping agent for Elastic Stack) created a new configuration file (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`).\n\nThere are no apparent signs of malicious activity in these logs, as they mostly represent routine system operations and software updates. However, it's always a good idea to monitor such activities for any unusual behavior.\n\nTo gain deeper insights, you might want to investigate the following:\n- What triggered `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` to download and install an update?\n- Why did `svchost.exe` create files in the DeliveryOptimization cache folder?\n- Was there any recent change or upgrade related to CompatTelRunner's DNS query?"}
