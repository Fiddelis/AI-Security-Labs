This is unusual behavior as it grants elevated privileges.\n- The use of `powershell.exe` in conjunction with these activities further increases suspicion, as PowerShell can be used for script-based attacks.\n- Although there are other events involving registry changes and file creation (e.g., `.winlogbeat.yml.new`), the primary concern is the privilege escalation attempts via user account management."}
