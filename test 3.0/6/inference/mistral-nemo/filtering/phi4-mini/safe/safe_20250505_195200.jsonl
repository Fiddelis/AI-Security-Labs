If so, consider renaming or deleting one of them.\n- Ensure that these new files are not taking up excessive disk space and are not negatively impacting your system's performance.\n- Keep an eye on this process (`SDXHelper.exe`).

Here are a few suggestions to troubleshoot this:\n\n1. **Check for duplicates**: Ensure that the files being created are not already present in the specified location. If they are, the process might be trying to overwrite them, leading to this issue.\n\n2. **Review the SDXHelper.exe process**: Investigate what this process is doing. It could be a background service, an update tool, or part of another application. Understanding its purpose can help you determine why it's creating multiple instances of these files.\n\n3. **Monitor file creation in real-time**: Use tools like Process Explorer (by Microsoft Sysinternals) or Resource Monitor (built into Windows) to monitor file creation events and see which process is actually creating these files.\n\n4. **Check for permissions issues**: There might be a problem with the SDXHelper.exe process not having the necessary permissions to create or overwrite these files, leading it to repeatedly try and fail.\n\n5. **Scan for malware**: If the SDXHelper.exe process is unknown or seems suspicious, consider scanning your system for malware. Some types of malware can cause issues like this.\n\n6. **Update or reinstall the associated software**: If the SDXHelper.exe process is related to a specific application (e.g., Microsoft Office), updating or reinstalling that software might resolve the issue.\n\nTo provide more targeted assistance, please specify:\n\n- The exact location where these files are being created.\n- Any error messages or warnings that accompany this behavior.\n- Other unusual activities happening on your system around the same time."}
