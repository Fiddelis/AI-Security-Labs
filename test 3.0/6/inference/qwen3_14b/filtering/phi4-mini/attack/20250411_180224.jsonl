{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch to see if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a process called cmd.exe running a command that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line includes creating a task that runs PowerShell with a script file. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That might be a red flag because the script name suggests it doesn't exist, which could be a trick to avoid detection. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a high-privilege account. That's suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a process for powershell.exe, but the event is about process access, not sure yet. Then another schtasks.exe event creating a scheduled task again, this time with a different script name: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is similar. The command line is almost the same as the first one, which might indicate a pattern.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple entries for svchost.exe with registry value sets. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, there's also a file created event for schtasks.exe in the system32 folder. Then, there are several events related to chrome.exe and registry changes, but those might be normal user activity. \n\nThe winlogbeat.exe events are about file creation, which could be part of the logging software, but not necessarily malicious. However, the repeated use of schtasks to create scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts is concerning. The fact that the tasks are created under the system account with high privileges could be an attempt to maintain persistence on the system. \n\nAlso, the use of PowerShell with -ep bypass is a known technique to bypass execution policies, which is often used in attacks. The script paths mentioned don't exist, which might be an attempt to avoid detection by using names that suggest they're not real. \n\nEven though there are some normal activities like chrome.exe and svchost.exe, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with suspicious scripts and using PowerShell with bypass parameters points towards a potential security threat. The confidence here is high because these are indicators of compromise commonly seen in malware or attack scenarios.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate the creation of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), which is a common technique for persistence and privilege escalation. The use of '-ep bypass' in PowerShell suggests attempts to circumvent execution policies, and the tasks are configured to run under the 'system' account with high privileges.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
