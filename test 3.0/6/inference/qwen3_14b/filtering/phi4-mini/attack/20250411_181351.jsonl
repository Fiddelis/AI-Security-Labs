{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity involving powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. The events mention tasks like 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. The 'Image loaded' events are pointing to various DLLs, some of which are system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit suspicious because while it's a legitimate file, its presence here might be part of something else.\n\nNow, looking at the command lines in some of the events. There's a repeated PowerShell command that uses System.Windows.Forms to capture the screen and save it as a PNG in the TEMP directory. The command is using Add-Type to load the assembly, then creating a bitmap, copying the screen, and saving it. This seems like it's taking screenshots. But why so many times? The same command is repeated multiple times with different filenames like 'unidade_logico.png', 'elemento_padrao.png', etc. \n\nTaking multiple screenshots in quick succession might be part of a larger action. Maybe the attacker is trying to capture sensitive information displayed on the screen, or perhaps they're part of a larger attack where screenshots are being taken for exfiltration. Also, the use of $env:TEMP suggests that the files are being stored temporarily, which is common in attacks to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAnother thing to note is the combination of events. There are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell. This could indicate that the process is being manipulated or that changes are being made to the registry, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by an attacker.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events include some legitimate system DLLs, but the fact that PowerShell is loading them might not be inherently malicious. However, the repetition and the context of the other events (like the screenshot commands) could indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not typical for normal operations.\n\nAlso, the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be related to the event logging system itself. But since they're associated with PowerShell commands, it's possible that the logs are being manipulated or that there's some interaction with the logging engine that's not standard.\n\nPutting this all together: the repeated screenshot commands, the multiple PowerShell events, and the loading of various DLLs could be indicative of an attacker taking screenshots for data exfiltration, possibly as part of a broader attack. The use of PowerShell in this manner, combined with the number of events, suggests that this is not normal user activity and warrants further investigation. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for a security investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **highly suspicious** and warrants investigation due to the following indicators of potential malicious activity:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns:**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Screenshot Commands**  \n   - Multiple events show PowerShell executing a **screenshot-capturing script** using `System.Windows.Forms` to save screenshots to the `%TEMP%` directory (e.g., `unidade_logico.png`, `modulo_principal.png`, etc.).  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - Taking **numerous screenshots** in quick succession is unusual for legitimate user activity.  \n     - Screenshots could be used to **exfiltrate sensitive information** (e.g., passwords, documents, or UI elements).  \n     - The use of `$env:TEMP` suggests **temporary storage**, often used in attacks to avoid leaving traces.\n\n2. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity**  \n   - **Frequent \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events** for `powershell.exe` indicate unusual interaction with the process or registry, which could signal **persistence mechanisms** or **malicious configuration changes**.\n\n3. **Loading of System DLLs via PowerShell**  \n   - Events like `Image loaded` for `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `MpOAV.dll` (a Windows Defender component) are **not inherently malicious**, but their combination with the screenshot commands raises red flags.  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - PowerShell loading system DLLs in this context may be part of **code injection** or **exploitation**.  \n     - The presence of `MpOAV.dll` (a legitimate Defender file) could indicate **tampering with security software** or **bypassing detection**.\n\n4. **Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" Events**  \n   - These events are tied to the **Windows Event Log system**. Their association with PowerShell commands could indicate **manipulation of logging mechanisms** or **attempts to obscure activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Hypotheses:**\n- **Data Exfiltration**: The screenshots may be part of **stealing sensitive data** displayed on the screen (e.g., credentials, proprietary information).  \n- **Persistence or Lateral Movement**: The registry and process interactions could be **setup for persistence** or **preparing for further attacks**.  \n- **Evasion**: The use of `%TEMP%` and repeated commands may aim to **avoid detection** by security tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the source** of the PowerShell commands (e.g., check for malicious scripts, untrusted executables, or scheduled tasks).  \n- **Analyze the screenshots** (if accessible) for sensitive content.  \n- **Check for unauthorized changes** to the registry or system files.  \n- **Monitor for lateral movement** or exfiltration attempts linked to the `%TEMP%` files.  \n- **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to confirm if this is part of a larger attack.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **highly likely to be malicious** and requires immediate investigation. The combination of repeated PowerShell screenshot commands, abnormal process\/registry interactions, and potential evasion tactics strongly suggests **an attacker is active on the system**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes. The first two entries show a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file names are something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... That looks suspicious because temporary files with such names might be used for malicious scripts. Then, there's a Pipe Created event, but no file associated. \n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command line that's pretty detailed. It's using Add-Type to load System.Windows.Forms, capturing the screen, and saving it as a PNG in the Temp directory. That seems odd. Why would someone take a screenshot via PowerShell? Maybe it's part of a larger attack, like capturing sensitive information displayed on the screen. But I need to check if this is normal behavior or if it's part of a malicious script.\n\nThen there's an event with 'Execute a Remote Command' but no process info. That's a red flag. If a remote command is executed without a clear process, it might indicate a remote access tool or a command and control connection. However, the next entry has another PowerShell script that's similar but saves a different image. Maybe these are part of the same activity, but why take multiple screenshots?\n\nLooking further, there's a file created in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That could be related to PowerShell profiles being modified, which might be a way to persist access. Also, there are several Registry value set events for PowerShell and other processes like conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe. Registry changes can be used to modify system behavior or install backdoors.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries have multiple Registry changes and an image load of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these might be part of bypassing antivirus, but it's also possible that it's normal if Chrome is interacting with Defender. However, the multiple Registry events for Chrome could be suspicious if they're modifying settings to disable security features.\n\nThe 'Execute a Remote Command' event is still unexplained. If that's part of a remote access, that's a clear indicator of a potential security incident. Also, the fact that PowerShell is being used to take screenshots might be a way to exfiltrate data, but without network events, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of PowerShell scripts creating and deleting files in Temp, taking screenshots, registry modifications, and the remote command execution suggests possible malicious activity. However, some events might be benign, like normal PowerShell usage or Chrome interacting with Defender. But the presence of the remote command and the screenshot scripts increases the likelihood of a security incident. The confidence might be around 0.75 because while some events are suspicious, others could be normal. But the classification would be INTERESTING due to the combination of these factors.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities involving temporary file creation\/deletion, screen capture via System.Windows.Forms, and suspicious registry modifications. The 'Execute a Remote Command' event and repeated Chrome.exe registry changes raise concerns about potential malicious behavior or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
