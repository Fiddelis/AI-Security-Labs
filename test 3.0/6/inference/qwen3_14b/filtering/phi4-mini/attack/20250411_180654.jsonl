{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file called objeto_temporario.txt. That's a temporary file, but creating a file isn't necessarily bad. However, the path is in the Downloads folder, which might be normal. But then there's a lot of chrome.exe entries with registry value sets. Multiple registry changes from chrome could be normal, but if it's too frequent, maybe something's wrong. However, the user hasn't mentioned any other issues, so maybe not.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. The command line shows it's running normally. But then there's a powershell.exe command that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystrokes could imply capturing user input, which is a red flag. The command_line parameter shows that the script is being executed with a specific path, which might be part of a malicious activity like keylogging.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe loading various .dll files from system directories. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the keystroke script, it might be part of a larger attack. Also, the file creation and deletion in the Temp folder could be part of a script that's trying to execute and then clean up traces.\n\nThe presence of multiple Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts in different paths suggests that the attacker might be trying to run the same malicious script from various locations, possibly to bypass detection. The fact that the logs include both file creation and deletion might indicate an attempt to hide the script's presence after execution.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated registry events from chrome.exe might be part of a broader attack vector, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the keylogging script is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Even though some events are normal, the combination of PowerShell executing keylogging scripts and the associated file operations points towards a potential security threat.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch is interesting because it contains evidence of potential keystroke logging, which is a common malicious activity. The other events, while possibly normal, don't outweigh the suspicious PowerShell activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains **suspicious activity** that warrants investigation, primarily due to the presence of **keystroke logging** and **potential exfiltration of sensitive data**. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Keystroke Logging via `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Scripts**\n- **Multiple entries** show PowerShell executing scripts named `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` from various paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_padrao\\pacote_secundario\\...`), all with the same command-line argument:  \n  ```powershell\n  -LogPath $env:TEMP\\key.log\n  ```\n  - **Implication**: These scripts are likely **keyloggers** designed to capture user input (e.g., passwords, credentials) and save them to temporary files. The repeated use of the same script name across different directories suggests an attempt to **obfuscate the attack** by varying the file paths.\n\n---\n\n### **2. File Creation and Deletion in Temp Folders**\n- **File creation**:\n  ```plaintext\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1\n  ```\n- **File deletion**:\n  ```plaintext\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1\n  ```\n  - **Implication**: The script is temporarily created and then deleted, a common tactic to **avoid leaving traces**. The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` mimics a legitimate PowerShell policy test, suggesting **masquerading** as a benign process.\n\n---\n\n### **3. PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Pipe Events**\n- **Pipe Created** event:\n  ```plaintext\n  {'task': 'Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)', 'file': 'None'}\n  ```\n  - **Implication**: The creation of a named pipe could indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)**, potentially used to **exfiltrate data** or coordinate malicious activities (e.g., between a keylogger and a remote server).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Defender DLL Load**\n- **File loaded**:\n  ```plaintext\n  C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll\n  ```\n  - **Implication**: While this is a legitimate Defender component, its loading by PowerShell could be part of an **attempt to bypass security software** (e.g., by exploiting Defender's processes).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Registry Modifications via Chrome**\n- **Multiple entries**:\n  ```plaintext\n  {'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)', 'file': 'None'}\n  ```\n  - **Implication**: Chrome's frequent registry changes might be normal, but combined with PowerShell's suspicious activity, it could indicate **tampering with system settings** or **injection of malicious code**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch is **highly suspicious** and **requires immediate investigation**. The key indicators (keystroke logging, temp file creation\/deletion, pipe events) strongly suggest **malicious activity**, likely aimed at **data exfiltration** or **credential harvesting**. Further analysis (e.g., checking the contents of `key.log`, examining the origin of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, and correlating with network traffic) is critical to confirm the threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Isolate the affected system** for forensic analysis.\n2. **Check the contents of `key.log` files** in the Temp directory.\n3. **Investigate the source of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** scripts (e.g., file hashes, parent processes).\n4. **Monitor network traffic** for exfiltration attempts.\n5. **Review Windows Defender logs** for signs of evasion or tampering."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, so there are several events here. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple instances of PowerShell being used. Now, PowerShell itself isn't necessarily bad, but the command lines associated with it might be. Let me check the command_line fields.\n\nThe first event has a PowerShell command that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saving the log to the TEMP directory. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystrokes usually relate to capturing user input, which could be part of a keylogger. Then there's another event with a similar command line, but the path is different. Both times, the script is being run with the -LogPath parameter, which is writing to the TEMP folder. That's a red flag because keyloggers often write logs to temporary directories to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are file creations and registry changes. Some of the files created are in the user's AppData or Downloads folder, which might be normal, but when combined with the PowerShell activity, it's more concerning. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files is probably part of log collection, but the other PowerShell activities are more suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script in different paths. Even though the paths are different, the fact that the same script name is used multiple times could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code. Also, the 'Execute a Remote Command' task might suggest that someone is trying to run commands from a remote source, which is a common attack vector.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators of compromise. The logs don't show any obvious malware names or hashes, but the behavior of capturing keystrokes and writing to temporary files is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The combination of these events across different processes and files makes me think this is worth investigating further. The confidence level is pretty high here because the keylogger script is a clear sign of potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with -LogPath parameter writing to TEMP directory, indicating potential keylogging activity. Repeated use of suspicious script names and file creation events in user directories suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
