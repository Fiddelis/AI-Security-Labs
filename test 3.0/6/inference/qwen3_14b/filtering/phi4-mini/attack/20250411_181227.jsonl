{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe commands. The command lines are similar, using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks. Each one uses New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe as the execute command. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running tasks as administrators with high privileges can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's creating tasks that launch calc.exe, which is a common tool for testing but could be a placeholder for more harmful payloads.\n\nThere are several entries with the same pattern, each with different task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The repetition of this activity might indicate an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, which could be part of a persistence mechanism. The fact that these are all registered under different names but with the same structure suggests automation or a script that's generating these tasks.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries about image loads, like mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded might be normal, but combined with the other events, it could be part of a larger attack. The file creation and deletion in the Temp folder might be part of the PowerShell script's temporary files, which is common but could also be a sign of evasion techniques.\n\nThe other events involve chrome.exe and pipe creation, but those don't seem as suspicious compared to the PowerShell activities. However, the multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights are concerning. Even though calc.exe is benign, the method of deployment here is unusual and could be a vector for more malicious code. The repetition of the same command across multiple logs strengthens the case for this being a significant event warranting investigation. So, putting it all together, this batch does appear to be interesting and likely requires further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially malicious activity** warranting investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repeated Scheduled Task Creation with Administrative Privileges**:\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` commands create scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` with **`calc.exe`** as the payload. \n   - Tasks are configured to run at **logon** with **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** and **\"Highest\"** run level, which is highly suspicious for legitimate use. \n   - Task names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`) suggest automation or obfuscation, possibly to evade detection.\n\n2. **Persistence Mechanism**:\n   - Creating multiple scheduled tasks with identical structures (but different names) suggests an attempt to **establish persistence** on the system. This is a common tactic in malware to ensure re-infection or long-term access.\n\n3. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This could indicate **evasion techniques** (e.g., dropping and executing a script without leaving long-term traces).\n\n4. **Unusual Image Loads**:\n   - While some loaded DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) are legitimate, the presence of **Windows Defender's `MpOAV.dll`** (antivirus component) during script execution might be coincidental. However, combined with the other events, it could signal an attempt to **bypass or interact with security software**.\n\n5. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose**:\n   - The use of `calc.exe` (a benign utility) as a payload is unusual in this context. This could be a **placeholder for malicious code** or an attempt to test if the system's defenses are bypassed.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- **Behavioral Anomalies**: The combination of administrative task creation, temporary file manipulation, and repeated PowerShell activity is inconsistent with typical user behavior.\n- **Potential Evasion**: The use of temporary files and scheduled tasks suggests an attempt to **avoid detection** by security tools.\n- **Privilege Abuse**: Leveraging `BUILTIN\\Administrators` privileges for task creation is highly suspicious unless explicitly authorized.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check for Malicious Payloads**: Analyze the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) if recoverable.\n2. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**: Verify if the tasks (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`) are legitimate or part of a malicious chain.\n3. **Monitor User Activity**: Investigate the account (`fiddelis`) executing these commands for unauthorized access.\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**: Look for other anomalous activity (e.g., network connections, file access) tied to these events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs shows **highly suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware persistence techniques** or **script-based attacks**. Immediate investigation is recommended to determine if this is part of a broader compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first thing I notice is that there are a couple of PowerShell commands that are creating scheduled tasks. The command lines show the use of New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are PowerShell cmdlets for creating and registering scheduled tasks. The tasks are set to run calc.exe, which is a common test application, but the fact that it's being scheduled with the Administrators group and highest run level might be suspicious.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries with the task 'Execute a Remote Command' and 'Registry value set'. However, most of these are associated with chrome.exe, svchost.exe, and other system processes. But the ones that stand out are the PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks. Also, there's a file created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum', which might be a scheduled task folder, and another file created in the user's Downloads directory. \n\nHowever, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory might be normal if someone is testing or installing software. But the key point here is the scheduled task creation. Creating a scheduled task with administrative privileges could be a sign of an attacker trying to maintain persistence. The use of 'calc.exe' is a red flag because it's often used in examples or tests, but in a real attack, it might be a placeholder for a malicious payload.\n\nBut wait, there are multiple entries of 'Execute a Remote Command' with process None. That might indicate that the system is being targeted with remote commands, but without a specific process, it's hard to tell. However, the scheduled task creation seems more concrete. The other entries with chrome.exe and svchost.exe doing registry changes might be benign, but combined with the scheduled task, it's a mix of normal and suspicious activities.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch does have some suspicious activities, specifically the scheduled task creation with administrative privileges. However, without more context, like the presence of actual malicious files or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence is moderate because while there's a suspicious event, it's not conclusive on its own. But since the question is whether it's relevant for investigation, the presence of the scheduled task creation is enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators group) that execute calc.exe. This could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code. Additional events include multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks and file creation in system directories, which may suggest suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of entries. But wait, chrome.exe typically doesn't modify the registry much. Maybe that's normal, but if it's happening a lot, could be suspicious. However, there are six instances of this, but they all look the same. Maybe it's just normal behavior, like chrome updating its settings. But I should check if there's any other events that might indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there's one event with winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The path seems to be in the Downloads folder, which is common for user-installed software. But the filename is .yml.new, which might be a temporary file during setup. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother event is powershell.exe creating a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt. The name is in Spanish, which might be a red flag. But creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, maybe. But alone, it's not conclusive.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The majority are chrome.exe registry changes, which could be benign. The other two events are file creations by winlogbeat and powershell. Unless there's a connection between these events, like the files being created for malicious purposes, but there's not enough info here. The justification for being interesting would be if there's a combination of events that suggest something unusual. However, in this case, the chrome.exe events are repetitive and possibly normal. The other events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. So maybe this isn't interesting enough. But I need to be careful. If the registry changes are part of a larger attack, like persistence mechanisms, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The confidence might be low, but I need to check if there's any pattern. Since all chrome events are the same, maybe it's just a normal process. The other events don't seem harmful. So classification would be NOT INTERESTING with low confidence, but maybe medium. Wait, the justification should be concise. Maybe the lack of clear malicious activity makes it not interesting. But I should check if registry changes by chrome are normal. Chrome does use the registry for some settings, but multiple changes could be a sign. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of powershell creating a file could be benign. So overall, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious behavior, so the classification is NOT INTERESTING with a confidence maybe around 0.4. But I need to make sure. The justification would be that there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, just normal process events and file creations that don't indicate a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repetitive registry modification events by chrome.exe (common for legitimate operations) and benign file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. No clear indicators of malicious activity or anomalous behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
