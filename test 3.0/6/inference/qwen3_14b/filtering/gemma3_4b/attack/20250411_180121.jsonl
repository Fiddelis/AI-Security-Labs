So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see multiple entries for powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is often used by attackers, so I need to check what's going on here.\n\nLooking at one of the PowerShell events, there's a command line that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub raw URL. The URLs mentioned are from various repositories, but the filenames are LICENSE.txt. Wait, downloading LICENSE files isn't necessarily bad, but the fact that this is happening multiple times with different repositories might be suspicious. However, GitHub does host LICENSE files, so maybe it's just legitimate activity.\n\nBut then there's an event where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory and then deletes it. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of a script that's trying to execute something without leaving traces. Also, the command lines show that PowerShell is being used to download files from different GitHub repos. However, the URLs are all from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is a common way to host text files. But the fact that it's happening multiple times might indicate that something is automating this process.\n\nAnother thing to note is the image loaded events for PowerShell. It's loading several .dll files, some related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, so not necessarily a problem. But the combination of multiple downloads and file operations could be part of a larger attack.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the batch is to be analyzed as a whole. So even though individual events might be normal, the combination could be suspicious. However, the logs don't show any clear signs of malicious activity. The PowerShell commands are downloading LICENSE files, which are legitimate. The file creation and deletion might be part of a benign script. Without more context, like the content of the downloaded files or unusual network destinations, it's hard to say. But the presence of multiple PowerShell events with GitHub downloads might be worth investigating further. However, since the URLs are from GitHub and the actions are common, maybe it's not malicious. So the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence, because while there are multiple PowerShell events, they don't clearly indicate a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal browser activity (chrome.exe DNS queries\/network connections) and PowerShell operations downloading LICENSE files from GitHub (common for legitimate software) and temporary file operations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used for downloading files from URLs, that's a red flag. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a PowerShell command that uses WebClient to download a file from GitHub. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is normal for hosting text files like LICENSE.txt. But wait, the filenames are things like \"estrutura_temporario.txt\" and \"estrutura_logico.txt\". The fact that they're downloading LICENSE.txt from different repositories might be benign, but the repetition of similar commands could indicate something. However, GitHub is a common source for open-source licenses, so maybe that's not malicious.\n\nThen there's the event where a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt. That's a user download directory, which is normal. But another file is created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which could be a place where malicious scripts are stored. However, just creating a file there isn't necessarily bad unless it's executing something.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but if it's done multiple times in a short period, it might be indicative of some activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The same goes for the other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. These could be normal operations.\n\nThe network connection detected event for MpDefenderCoreService.exe might be related to Windows Defender checking for updates or malware, which is normal. The Dns query event is also common and not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe events involve creating files in the download directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its setup. That seems normal.\n\nNow, looking at the PowerShell commands again. The use of WebClient to download files from GitHub might be part of a legitimate script, but the fact that there are multiple such events could be a sign of something. However, the URLs point to LICENSE.txt files, which are typically harmless. Unless the attacker is using a GitHub repository to host malicious content disguised as a license file, but that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of similar PowerShell commands. If this is part of a script that's being run multiple times, maybe to download different files or execute commands, that's more suspicious. But in the given logs, the commands are all downloading LICENSE.txt from different repositories, which might be part of a legitimate process, like setting up dependencies.\n\nThe file creation events in the TEMPORARIO and LOGICO names might be temporary files, but again, without knowing the content, it's hard to tell. The presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could be part of a normal application setup, but if done in an unusual way, it could be malicious.\n\nHowever, considering all the events, I don't see any clear signs of malware or attacks. The activities seem to be within normal operations: downloading files, creating configuration files, modifying registry entries. Unless there's an unusual pattern or additional context (like the files being executed or having malicious content), the logs don't indicate a security threat. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate a clear security threat or malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands to download `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`). \n   - **Context:** GitHub is a legitimate source for open-source licenses. These commands appear to be standard operations (e.g., fetching license files for projects), not inherently malicious.\n\n2. **File Creation Events:**\n   - Files like `estrutura_temporario.txt`, `entrada_base.txt`, and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` are created in user directories or temporary locations. \n   - **Context:** These are typical for application setup, configuration, or user-initiated downloads. No suspicious file types or paths are noted.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for processes like `chrome.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `notepad.exe`.\n   - **Context:** Registry changes are common during software installation or configuration. No evidence of anomalous or unauthorized modifications is present.\n\n4. **Network Activity:**\n   - `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` (Windows Defender) has a network connection event. This is expected for security software to communicate with update servers.\n   - No unusual network destinations or patterns are indicated.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates `.yml.new` files, which are part of its normal operation when configuring logging pipelines. This is consistent with legitimate usage.\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Mitigated by Context):**\n- **Repetition of PowerShell Commands:** While multiple similar commands are present, they all involve downloading `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub, which is a benign activity in this context.\n- **File Names and Paths:** The file names (`estrutura_temporario.txt`, `entrada_base.txt`) are generic and not linked to known malicious payloads.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect routine system and application activities (e.g., software configuration, license file retrieval, and log setup). There is **no evidence of malware, unauthorized access, or suspicious behavior** requiring further investigation. The activities align with typical user and application behavior on a Windows system. \n\n**Final Verdict:** *Not interesting for investigation*â€”the observed events are consistent with normal operations."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries involving 'svchost.exe' and 'powershell.exe' with registry events. But wait, there's also a 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. Hmm, that's interesting because 'calc.exe' is a legitimate Windows process, but maybe the fact that it's loading a DLL could be suspicious if it's not normal. However, 'urlmon.dll' is part of the Windows system, so that might be okay.\n\nThen, there's a 'cmd.exe' process that's running a command to delete a scheduled task named 'spawn'. That seems like a red flag. Deleting a scheduled task could be part of an attempt to remove malware or a backdoor. Also, there's a 'schtasks.exe' process that's being used to delete a task. But then there's another entry where 'schtasks.exe' loads 'taskschd.dll', which is a legitimate system file. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of 'cmd.exe' and 'reg.exe' deleting registry keys under 'HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run'. This is concerning because modifying the Run keys can be used to set up persistent malware. The fact that 'reg.exe' is being used to delete these entries might indicate someone trying to clean up after installing a malicious payload or removing existing ones.\n\nAlso, 'whoami.exe' is being executed multiple times. While that's a normal utility to check user context, if it's being run repeatedly in a short period, it might be part of a script to gather information for an attack. \n\nAnother point is the use of 'powershell.exe' with 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so frequent access events could indicate malicious activity. \n\nPutting this all together: the combination of registry modifications, scheduled task deletions, and PowerShell activity might suggest an attempt to modify system settings or remove traces of an attack. However, some of these activities could be part of legitimate system maintenance. But the repeated deletions of registry keys and the use of commands to manipulate scheduled tasks are more indicative of something malicious. The presence of both legitimate processes and suspicious commands makes it a bit tricky, but the overall pattern leans towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated registry modifications (deletion of Run keys), scheduled task deletion attempts, and PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage with potential cleanup commands.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, Provider Lifecycle, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDelete. There are several entries where PowerShell is loading DLLs, some of which are part of the .NET framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those seem legitimate because they're standard components. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which might be normal too, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate files.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces. Also, the multiple instances of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks with PowerShell might indicate some automated process or possibly a script that's running multiple times.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of 'Pipe Created' events. While pipes are normal for inter-process communication, if there's an unusual number or unexpected context, it could be a red flag. However, in this case, it's just one event.\n\nThe user also has a winlogbeat.exe process creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be part of a log collection tool, which is normal if they're using it for monitoring. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there's a 'Registry value set' by PowerShell. Modifying registry values can be part of legitimate configuration changes, but it's also a common tactic for malware to persist or alter system settings. However, without more context on what specific registry keys were changed, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe repetition of certain events, like multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks, might indicate that a script is being run in a loop or that there's some automation that's not properly configured. However, this could also be part of a normal process if, for example, a PowerShell script is being tested or used for legitimate administrative tasks.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script, multiple image loads that include both legitimate and potential security-related DLLs, and the repeated lifecycle events. While some of these activities are normal, the combination of creating a temporary script and the high number of PowerShell-related events could indicate a script that's trying to perform actions without leaving evidence, which is a common tactic in malicious activities. However, without more context or additional suspicious indicators (like network activity, unexpected command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files), it's a bit ambiguous. But given the presence of the temporary script and the volume of PowerShell events, it's leaning towards being worth further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows a mix of legitimate system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **High Frequency:** Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` with tasks like `Provider Lifecycle`, `Engine Lifecycle`, and `Pipe Created`. While PowerShell is a standard tool, repetitive lifecycle events may suggest automation or script execution.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory and immediately deleted. This pattern is often seen in **malicious scripts** attempting to execute payloads without leaving persistent traces.\n\n2. **DLL Loading:**\n   - **Legitimate Components:** Loading of `.NET` framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is normal for PowerShell execution.\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs:** `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` are part of Windows Defender. While legitimate, their presence could be **mimicked by malware** to evade detection.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - `Registry value set` by `powershell.exe` could indicate **configuration changes** or **persistence mechanisms**. Without context on specific keys, this remains ambiguous but warrants scrutiny.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - A file is created by `winlogbeat.exe` in the `Downloads` directory. This is likely part of **log collection** if Winlogbeat is configured for monitoring. However, if unexpected, it could indicate **data exfiltration** or **tool misuse**.\n\n5. **Other Processes:**\n   - `conhost.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` are legitimate, but their involvement in registry changes or file operations should be cross-checked against system baselines.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The activity includes **normal PowerShell usage** and **legitimate system processes**, but the **creation\/deletion of a temporary script** and **repetitive lifecycle events** are **potential red flags** for **script-based attacks** or **exploitation attempts**.\n- **No Clear Malicious Indicators:** No direct evidence of malware (e.g., network connections, suspicious command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files) is present in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Script:** Analyze the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1`) if recoverable. Check for remnants in logs or memory dumps.\n2. **Check PowerShell Execution Policy:** Ensure the system's PowerShell execution policy is not overly permissive (e.g., `RemoteSigned` or `AllSigned`).\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies:** Correlate these events with **network traffic**, **user behavior**, and **system integrity checks** (e.g., antivirus scans, file integrity monitoring).\n4. **Review Winlogbeat Configuration:** Confirm that Winlogbeat is properly configured and not being used for unintended purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events are not definitively malicious, the combination of **temporary script creation**, **repetitive PowerShell activity**, and **registry modifications** warrants **further investigation**. These could be part of a **legitimate administrative task**, but they also align with **malicious patterns** seen in script-based attacks."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there's 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a normal command to get the current user. Then 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' are appearing multiple times with various tasks like Process Create, Process Access, and Registry value set. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate process, but the repeated use of PowerShell and CMD could be a red flag, especially if they're doing unusual things.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'cmd.exe' with a command line that starts with 'cmd.exe \/c ', which might be executing a command. But the rest is cut off. Then, there are several 'Registry value set' events for 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe'. Changing registry values can be part of normal operations, but if done in a way that's not typical, it might indicate something malicious.\n\nNow, some of the entries mention 'Image loaded' events. The files loaded here are like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal for PowerShell to load these. However, there's also 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. Loading that might be normal, but I need to check if it's expected here.\n\nThen, there's a 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' event for a temporary script file in the user's AppData. The file is named something like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1'. The creation and immediate deletion of a script file could be suspicious. It might be part of a script execution that's trying to avoid leaving traces. The name suggests it's related to PowerShell script policy testing, which could be legitimate, but if it's happening in an unexpected context, it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the command line 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an empty command. Maybe that's part of some logging or monitoring, but repeated instances might not be normal.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch shows normal processes like whoami, powershell, cmd, and registry changes. However, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, along with multiple PowerShell and CMD activities, could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or modify system settings. The presence of the script file in the Temp directory and its quick deletion might be a sign of an attacker trying to run a script without leaving evidence. However, without more context, like the actual content of the script or other suspicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the combination of events, it's probably worth investigating further to ensure there's no malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n- **Legitimate Processes**: Processes like `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` are standard on Windows systems. The loading of .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) is typical for PowerShell operations.\n- **Windows Defender Component**: The `MpOAV.dll` file is part of Windows Defender, and its loading is expected during security-related operations.\n\n### **Suspicious Behavior**\n1. **Script File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1`) is **created** in the user's Temp directory and **immediately deleted**. This pattern is often seen in **malicious scripts** that execute and then erase evidence. While the filename suggests a \"script policy test\" (which could be legitimate), the rapid creation\/deletion raises concerns about **hidden or obfuscated activity**.\n\n2. **Frequent PowerShell\/CMD Activity**:\n   - Multiple **Process Create**, **Registry modification**, and **File operation** events involving `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` suggest **active scripting or configuration changes**. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate **script-based attacks**, **configuration tampering**, or **exploitation attempts**.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Repeated **Registry value set** events for `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` could signal **tampering with system policies** or **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries, modifying security settings).\n\n### **Key Questions for Further Investigation**\n- **What is the content of the deleted script file?** If the script contains malicious code (e.g., downloaders, credential stealers), this would confirm exploitation.\n- **Is the user \"fiddelis\" a legitimate account?** If this is a service account or a user with elevated privileges, the activity could indicate **privilege escalation**.\n- **Are there correlated events outside this log?** (e.g., network connections to suspicious IPs, unauthorized software installations).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is normal, the **creation and deletion of a temporary script file**, combined with **frequent PowerShell\/CMD usage** and **registry modifications**, **strongly suggest a potential security incident**. This warrants immediate investigation, including:\n- Analyzing the deleted script's metadata (if recoverable).\n- Checking for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n- Reviewing user permissions and system integrity.\n\n**Action Required**: Escalate to a security analyst for deeper forensic analysis."}

Then, several instances of powershell.exe with various tasks like Pipe Created, Registry value set, and Process accessed. Chrome.exe also appears multiple times with similar events. \n\nWait, but the key here is to look for patterns that might indicate malicious behavior. The fact that powershell.exe is involved in multiple registry modifications and process accesses could be a red flag. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a concern.\n\nLooking deeper, there's an entry where powershell.exe is creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files. Then, there's a command line that removes a file named objeto_principal.zip from the temp directory. Maybe that's part of cleaning up after an attack?\n\nAlso, several Image Load events for PowerShell involve .NET framework DLLs.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender path, which seems normal. Then, a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. But then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's odd. Creating and deleting a script in the Temp folder might be part of a cleanup, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving traces.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing Remove-Item commands on various .zip and .txt files in the Temp directory. The commands use -ErrorAction Ignore, which suppresses errors, so even if the files don't exist, it won't log an error. That could be a way to avoid detection. The fact that there are so many files being deleted from Temp might indicate that something is trying to clean up after itself, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the other processes: chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. There's also a whoami.exe process, which is just a standard tool to check user context, so not suspicious on its own.\n\nBut focusing back on PowerShell: the repeated deletion of files in Temp, especially with the -Force parameter, might be part of an attempt to remove evidence. Also, the fact that the same script file is created and then deleted quickly could be a sign of an injected script that's executing and then cleaning up. The use of $env:TEMP suggests that the attacker is using temporary directories to store files, which is common in malware.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other signs. Are there any unusual registry changes or other processes involved? The logs mention some Registry value sets, but they're associated with chrome.exe and conhost.exe, which might be normal. The PowerShell events don't show any obvious malicious commands beyond the file deletions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the main suspicious activity is the creation and immediate deletion of PowerShell scripts in the Temp directory, along with multiple deletions of various files. This pattern could be indicative of an attacker trying to execute a script and then remove it to avoid detection.

Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about Chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe performing registry value sets. Then there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed, and whoami.exe being created. Also, there's a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a file and powershell.exe creating another file called pacote_ativo.txt.\n\nHmm, so first, Chrome and RuntimeBroker doing registry changes. That's normal for some operations, but if it's a lot, maybe suspicious. However, the majority here are Chrome, which might be normal if the user is using the browser. But I should check for any anomalies.\n\nThen, the PowerShell accesses. Multiple entries of Process accessed (ProcessAccess) for PowerShell. That could be normal, but if it's being accessed a lot, maybe someone is trying to run scripts. Also, whoami.exe is being created multiple times. Whoami is a legitimate tool that shows the current user, but if it's being executed repeatedly, maybe part of a script or a malicious activity.\n\nWait, the file creation by winlogbeat.exe is for a .yml.new file.

However, without more context, like the content of the file or other network activity, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of these events might be worth investigating further. So, I'd say it's interesting, but with medium confidence because some parts could be normal, but the presence of multiple PowerShell and whoami events plus an unusual file name might indicate something malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process accesses, repeated whoami.exe executions, and creation of a suspicious file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' (Portuguese for 'active package') suggest potential malicious activity. While some events (e.g., Chrome.exe registry changes) may be benign, the combination of process access anomalies and unusual file creation warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
