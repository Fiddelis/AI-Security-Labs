So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. Multiple network connections might be part of regular browsing, but maybe if there's an unusual number, but the count here isn't specified. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a legitimate tool for checking user identity, but if it's used in a context that's unexpected, maybe. But here, it's just a Process Create event. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThe powershell.exe events are more numerous. There's ProcessAccess, Registry changes, and some ImageLoad events. The ImageLoad entries include .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so loading them is normal. But then there's MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe if it's being loaded in an unusual way?\n\nLooking at the command lines for some powershell.exe processes: they're modifying the LastWriteTime of files to 1\/1\/1970. That's a common tactic used by malware to hide files by making them appear old. The paths mentioned are in directories like \"C:\\registro_logico\" and \"C:\\modulo_logico\", which might be obfuscated or fake paths. The command lines use \"Get-ChildItem\" and then set the LastWriteTime. That's a red flag because changing file timestamps can be part of evasion techniques.\n\nAlso, there's a FileCreated and then immediately FileDeleteDetected for a temporary script file. That might be part of a script that's executed and then cleaned up. The filename is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but combined with the other actions, it could be part of a malicious process.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be normal, but combined with other activities, it's worth noting. The RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying registry values could be benign, but if they're part of a larger pattern, maybe not.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious parts are the PowerShell commands modifying file timestamps, the creation and deletion of a temp script, and the use of .NET DLLs. These could indicate an attempt to manipulate the system or execute scripts stealthily. However, without more context, like the actual content of the scripts or other indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of these events does raise concerns, so it's probably worth investigating further. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of benign and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **File Timestamp Manipulation via PowerShell**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands to modify the `LastWriteTime` of files to **January 1, 1970** (e.g., `Get-ChildItem \"C:\\modulo_logico...\" | % { $_.LastWriteTime = \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\" }`).\n   - **Why this is concerning**: Resetting timestamps to a specific date is a common **malware evasion technique** to hide files or make them appear dormant. The paths referenced (e.g., `C:\\registro_logico`, `C:\\modulo_logico`) may be obfuscated or decoy directories.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A PowerShell process creates a temporary script file (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1`) and immediately deletes it.\n   - **Why this is concerning**: This pattern is often seen in **malware** or **post-exploitation activities** to avoid leaving evidence. The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` may mimic legitimate PowerShell testing scripts but could be a decoy.\n\n3. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - PowerShell loads `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender) and .NET framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While these are legitimate, the context (e.g., combined with timestamp manipulation) warrants scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Benign Activity**\n- **Chrome.exe**: Normal DNS queries and network connections.\n- **whoami.exe**: A standard tool for checking user identity.\n- **RuntimeBroker.exe** and **notepad.exe**: Modifying registry values is common for legitimate applications (e.g., configuration changes).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs contain **potential indicators of compromise (IOCs)**, particularly the timestamp manipulation and temporary script behavior. These activities could be part of **malware evasion**, **script-based attacks**, or **post-exploitation actions**. However, further investigation is needed to confirm malicious intent, such as:\n- Analyzing the content of the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1`).\n- Correlating these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user behavior).\n- Checking for additional anomalies (e.g., unauthorized access, privilege escalation).\n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate the PowerShell commands and temporary script further, and consider checking for signs of **script-based malware** or **file tampering**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll look through the JSONL entries.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes running commands that modify the LastWriteTime of files to a specific date, which is 01\/01\/1970. That's the Unix epoch, so setting a file's timestamp to that might be an attempt to hide the file's true creation or modification time, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The paths mentioned are all over the system, some in typical directories, others in places like C:\\unidade_logico, which might be a typo or a custom path. The fact that multiple files are being modified in this way raises a red flag.\n\nThen there are other entries about svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe performing registry value sets and image loads. Some of these are normal, like svchost.exe managing services, but the repeated registry changes might be suspicious. However, the majority of the events are the PowerShell commands modifying timestamps. \n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell commands with the same pattern (changing LastWriteTime) across different file paths suggests a possible automated script or malicious activity. The timestamps being set to a specific date could be an attempt to alter file metadata for evasion. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or network activity here. The other processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe are common and might not be suspicious on their own. But combined with the PowerShell activities, it's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious behavior. \n\nI should check if the PowerShell commands are using legitimate paths or if they're in unusual locations. The paths given are a mix of what look like system directories and some that might be user-specific. The fact that the user is using '..' in the paths could indicate directory traversal, which is common in scripts trying to access parent directories to find files. \n\nSince the main suspicious activity is the repeated modification of file timestamps via PowerShell, and considering that this is a pattern that's not typical in normal user behavior, I'd classify this as interesting. The confidence is medium to high because while some events are normal, the PowerShell activities are suspicious and could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Interesting\",\n  \"REASON\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands to set file LastWriteTime to 01\/01\/1970 (Unix epoch), a common tactic to obscure file timestamps.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them involve 'chrome.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded'. There are a few other processes like 'winlogbeat.exe' and 'powershell.exe' creating files, but those seem normal. The main thing here is the repeated registry events and image loads from chrome.exe.\n\nWait, the 'Image loaded' events mention amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. But why would chrome.exe be loading these files? Normally, these DLLs are part of the system's security features. However, if a legitimate process is loading them, that's normal. But if it's a malicious process masquerading as chrome.exe, that could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, there's no indication here that these files are being modified or that there's any unusual activity beyond the normal operations. The registry events are just setting values, which can be normal for Chrome as it runs. The repetition of the same events might be normal behavior, but maybe too many of them could indicate something. However, the presence of legitimate system files being loaded by Chrome might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nWait, but looking at the confidence, the user might be expecting that if there's a pattern of Chrome doing a lot of registry changes and loading specific DLLs, that could be part of an attack. However, without more context, like unusual registry keys being modified, or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. The events here don't show any clear malicious activity. The other processes like winlogbeat and powershell creating files are normal user activities.\n\nSo, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The events are either normal operations or benign. The repetition of Chrome events might be normal for the browser's operation. Unless there's a specific rule that triggers an alert on these events, but based on the given data, there's no clear indication of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal Chrome operations (registry modifications and loading legitimate system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll), with no clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior. Other events (e.g., winlogbeat and powershell file creation) appear benign.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
