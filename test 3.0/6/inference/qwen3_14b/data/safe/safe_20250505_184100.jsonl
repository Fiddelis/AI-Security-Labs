So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: DiscordSetup.exe is being created. That's a normal setup file for Discord. Then, there's an image loaded for the same executable. That seems okay too. Next, the setup process creates an Update.exe in the SquirrelTemp directory. Squirrel is a framework used for updating apps, so this might be part of a legitimate update process.\n\nThen, Update.exe is executed with an install command. The image load events include .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. That's typical for applications that use .NET. There are several image loads, which might be normal for the update process.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. ProcessAccess can indicate that another process is interacting with Update.exe, which might be normal during an update, but if there are too many, it could be a sign of something suspicious. But in this case, since it's part of the Squirrel update framework, which does manipulate processes during installation, maybe it's legitimate.\n\nThen, the Update.exe creates a new Discord.exe in the AppData directory. That's part of the installation process. The command line for Discord.exe includes --squirrel-install, which is a known parameter used by Squirrel during installation. This seems legitimate.\n\nBut wait, there's also a FileCreate event for a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but that's separate from the Discord installation. However, the user didn't mention anything about Winlogbeat, so maybe that's unrelated. Unless that's part of some configuration that's unexpected.\n\nLooking at all the events, the main activity is around installing Discord via Squirrel. The use of Squirrel is common for auto-updaters, so the creation of Update.exe and the subsequent process activities are typical. However, the high number of ProcessAccess events might be a red flag. But considering the context, if the user is installing a legitimate application, those events are part of the normal process.\n\nAnother point is that all the files are in expected locations: Downloads, AppData, and the .NET framework directories. The executable names match known legitimate files for Discord and its updater. There's no mention of unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this seems to be a legitimate installation and update process. The events are consistent with normal behavior for installing an application using Squirrel. Therefore, the batch is not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent a legitimate Discord installation via Squirrel framework, with typical process creation, image loading, and file operations.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to Discord.exe and Update.exe. There's a lot of Image Load events, which is normal for applications starting up and loading their components. For example, Discord.exe loading ffmpeg.dll and its own executable. Also, there are Pipe Created events, which might be part of normal communication between processes, like for IPC (Inter-Process Communication). \n\nThen there's the Update.exe process. It's creating a shortcut and running some .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That seems like part of a legitimate update process. The command line for Update.exe includes creating a shortcut for Discord.exe, which is a common action during software updates. \n\nLooking at the command line arguments for Discord.exe, there are parameters like --type=crashpad-handler and --type=gpu-process, which are typical for Electron applications (since Discord is built on Electron). These are normal operations for the application to handle crashes and GPU rendering. \n\nThe paths mentioned are all within the user's AppData directory, which is standard for application data. The use of .NET assemblies in Update.exe is also expected for an update process. There's no mention of any unexpected or malicious files being loaded. \n\nHowever, I should check for any anomalies. Are there any unusual files being loaded? The ffmpeg.dll is loaded twice, but that's likely part of the application's normal operation. The Pipe Created events are frequent but again, not necessarily suspicious unless there's an unusual number or unexpected context. \n\nNo events indicate unauthorized access, unexpected network activity, or any signs of malware. All processes are related to Discord and its update mechanism. The command line parameters are standard for the application's various processes (crashpad-handler, gpu-process, etc.). \n\nSo, considering all these points, the events seem to be part of normal application behavior. There's no indication of malicious activity here. Therefore, this batch of events is not interesting for investigation as they appear legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events observed appears to be **legitimate and consistent with normal application behavior**, specifically related to the operation of **Discord** and its **update process**. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Discord.exe Activity:**\n   - **Image Load Events:** \n     - Discord.exe loads its own executable (`Discord.exe`) and `ffmpeg.dll`, which is common for applications to initialize components (e.g., media processing).\n     - Multiple `Pipe Created` events are logged, which are typical for **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** in Electron-based applications (Discord uses Electron). These pipes facilitate communication between the main application, GPU processes, and crash handlers.\n   - **Command-Line Parameters:** \n     - Parameters like `--type=gpu-process` and `--type=crashpad-handler` are standard for Electron apps to manage GPU rendering and crash reporting.\n\n2. **Update.exe Activity:**\n   - **Legitimate Update Process:** \n     - The `Update.exe` process is creating a shortcut for Discord.exe and loading .NET assemblies (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clr.dll`). This is consistent with a **software update mechanism** (e.g., updating Discord).\n     - The use of .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) is expected during update operations.\n\n3. **File Paths and Context:**\n   - All files are loaded from the user's **AppData directory** (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\...`), which is standard for application data and updates.\n   - No suspicious or non-standard files (e.g., unknown DLLs, executables from unexpected locations) are referenced.\n\n---\n\n### **No Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n- **No Anomalies Detected:** \n  - The events align with expected behavior for a running application and its update process.\n  - No signs of **unauthorized access**, **unexpected network activity**, or **malicious payloads** are present.\n  - The frequency of `Pipe Created` events and `Image Load` events is consistent with normal IPC and application initialization.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events does **not indicate malicious activity** or require further investigation. The observed behavior is **typical for Discord** and its update process, and all activities are consistent with legitimate application operations.\n\n**Final Verdict:** ‚ùå **Not Interesting for Investigation** (Legitimate Application Behavior)."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: Discord.exe is being created with a long command line. The command line has various flags, but it seems normal for a Discord process. The task is \"Process Create,\" which is typical for legitimate applications starting up.\n\nThen there are several \"Process accessed\" and \"Image loaded\" events for Discord.exe. These are common during normal operation as the application loads necessary DLLs like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, and libGLESv2.dll. These DLLs are often used for multimedia and graphics, which makes sense for Discord.\n\nNow, looking at the entries involving Update.exe. There are multiple \"File created\" events for Discord.lnk shortcuts in different locations, like the Start Menu and the Desktop. Also, there are numerous \"Process accessed\" events for Update.exe. While creating shortcuts isn't inherently malicious, the high frequency of these events might be suspicious. However, Update.exe is a legitimate process for software updates, so this could be part of a normal update process.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many \"Process accessed\" events for Update.exe? That's a lot. Maybe it's just a normal update, but the repetition could indicate something. However, without more context, like unexpected network activity or unauthorized changes, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple shortcut creations might be part of a legitimate update, but it's worth checking if the user initiated an update.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events don't show clear signs of malware, like unusual network connections, unauthorized file modifications, or privilege escalation. All the processes mentioned are related to Discord and its updates. The high number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe might be a red flag, but without more data, it's hard to confirm. Since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, and there's no explicit malicious activity detected, it's probably not interesting. However, the justification should note the unusual frequency of events for Update.exe, even though it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events relate to legitimate Discord application behavior, including process creation, image loading of expected DLLs (e.g., ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll), and shortcut creation during updates.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to analyze them as a whole.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's Discord.exe and Update.exe. The initial events show Discord loading some DLLs like libEGL.dll, vulkan-1.dll, and vk_swiftshader.dll. Those are legitimate files for Discord, especially related to graphics, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a lot of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. That's a lot of entries‚Äîlike 13 times. That seems unusual. Why would Update.exe be accessing processes so many times?\n\nThen there's the part where reg.exe is adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for Discord, pointing to Update.exe with a parameter to start Discord.exe. That's a red flag because adding to the Run key can be a way to persist malware. Also, there's another reg.exe event adding a registry entry under Software\\Classes\\Discord for a URL protocol. That might be part of creating a custom protocol handler, which could be benign but sometimes used by malware.\n\nAlso, the creation of Discord.lnk shortcuts in the Start Menu and on the Desktop. Creating shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but if done in a way that's not user-initiated, it could be suspicious. The fact that Update.exe is creating these files might be part of an installation or update process, but combined with the registry changes and the numerous process accesses, it might indicate something more.\n\nThe Pipe Created events for Discord.exe could be normal communication between processes, but again, the high frequency of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe is concerning. The confidence here is medium because while some activities are normal for software updates, the combination of registry modifications, shortcut creation, and excessive process accesses might indicate a potential malicious behavior, like a trojan or backdoor. However, without more context, it's not certain. So, the classification might be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'Update.exe' creates multiple shortcuts and triggers numerous 'ProcessAccess' events, which may indicate persistence mechanisms or lateral movement. 2) 'reg.exe' modifies registry keys to add Discord to the Run registry hive and creates a custom protocol handler, which could be used for persistence or phishing. 3) High frequency of 'ProcessAccess' events for 'Update.exe' suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events here are related to Discord.exe. There are multiple entries of \"Pipe Created\" events, which might be normal for a running application, but I should check if there's anything unusual. Then there are some reg.exe commands modifying the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That's about associating file types or URLs with Discord. The commands add URL Protocol, DefaultIcon, and the shell open command. That seems like part of setting up a protocol handler, which is common for applications like Discord to handle custom URLs. But maybe that's part of a legitimate installation or update?\n\nThen there's the Update.exe process. It's loading some DLLs, creating a shortcut in the Start Menu, and accessing the process. The ImageLoad events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll might be normal, but the Update.exe creating a shortcut could be part of a legitimate update process. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events for Update.exe might indicate some unusual activity. Also, the fact that reg.exe is being used to modify the registry could be a red flag if it's not part of a known legitimate process. \n\nWait, looking at the command lines for reg.exe, they are adding entries to the registry for Discord's URL protocol. That's typically done by applications to handle custom URLs, like when you click a Discord link. But the user might be concerned if this is done without user consent or if it's part of a malicious payload. However, the presence of Update.exe and the creation of a shortcut might be part of a legitimate update. But why are there so many ProcessAccess events for Update.exe? That might be normal if it's communicating with a server, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, the fact that the same process, Discord.exe, is being accessed multiple times and creating pipes could be normal, but if it's creating too many or if the pipes are being used for unexpected communication, that might be suspicious. However, the logs don't show any network activity or unusual file access beyond the registry changes and shortcut creation.\n\nAnother point: the presence of ffmpeg.dll being loaded by Discord.exe. Is that normal? Discord might use ffmpeg for some media processing, but it's worth checking if that's a legitimate library. However, without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious elements are the registry modifications by reg.exe and the multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. However, these could be part of a legitimate update process. The repetition of events might be normal for a running application, but the combination of registry changes and process accesses might indicate some form of installation or update. However, since all the processes are related to Discord and Update.exe (which might be part of the Discord update mechanism), it might not be malicious. But I'm not entirely sure.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the entries are about \"Update.exe\" with ProcessAccess events. That's a lot of them. But then there's one entry where \"Update.exe\" creates a file called \"Discord.lnk\" on the desktop. That seems a bit odd. Why would an update process create a shortcut? Maybe it's just a normal operation, but sometimes malware creates shortcuts to execute malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there's a Registry value set event by \"Update.exe\" and then a ProcessTerminate. Also, \"Discord.exe\" is involved in several events, including DNS queries, pipe creations, and image loads. The command line for one of the Discord.exe processes has a URL that's \"https:\/\/f.a.k\/e\", which looks like a placeholder or fake URL. That's suspicious because it might be a phishing attempt or pointing to a malicious server.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple ImageLoad events for Discord.exe, which is normal for a legitimate application. But the presence of \"ffmpeg.dll\" being loaded might be okay if it's part of Discord's dependencies. However, the fake URL in the command line raises a red flag. Also, the fact that Update.exe is creating a shortcut and modifying the registry could be signs of malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nBut wait, some of these events could be normal. For example, processes accessing each other and creating shortcuts might be part of legitimate software updates. However, the combination of the fake URL, the shortcut creation, and registry changes might indicate something malicious. The confidence here is a bit tricky.

The paths mentioned are all within the default installation directory for Discord, which is expected. There's also a \"File created\" event for a Discord.lnk shortcut on the desktop and in the Start Menu. Creating shortcuts is normal during installation or when setting up shortcuts manually.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of \"Process accessed\" events.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to Discord.exe. There are a bunch of \"Process accessed\" and \"Pipe Created\" events. But what's unusual is that there are also entries involving reg.exe, which is a Windows utility for modifying the registry. Let me check those specific lines.\n\nLooking at the reg.exe entries, there's a command line that adds a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. The command is adding a value \"URL:Discord Protocol\" and another entry for \"URL Protocol\". This seems like it's setting up a protocol handler for Discord. While setting up protocol handlers isn't inherently malicious, it's something that could be done by malware to hijack URLs or redirect traffic. However, Discord is a legitimate application, so maybe this is part of its normal installation process.\n\nBut wait, there are multiple entries of the same process being accessed repeatedly. The high frequency of \"Process accessed\" and \"Pipe Created\" events might be normal for Discord, which is a complex application with many components. However, the presence of reg.exe modifying the registry could be a red flag if it's not part of a legitimate update or installation. \n\nAnother point is the command line for Discord.exe. The command line includes various flags and parameters, which is typical for applications, but the presence of certain flags might be worth checking. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're suspicious.\n\nThe key thing here is whether the reg.exe activity is legitimate. If Discord is installing or updating, it's possible that it's modifying the registry. But if this is happening in an unexpected context, like on a system where Discord wasn't installed before, or if there are other signs of compromise, that would be concerning. However, in the given logs, there's no indication of other malicious activities like file modifications, network connections to suspicious IPs, or unexpected process creations beyond what's related to Discord.\n\nSo, considering all this, the batch has some suspicious elements, but they might be part of normal operations. The repeated process accesses and pipe creations could be normal for Discord's operation. However, the registry modifications by reg.exe might be a point of interest. But without additional context or other indicators of compromise, it's not conclusive enough to classify this as definitely interesting.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to the Discord application. The user is running Discord, which is a legitimate application, but the logs show some activity that might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a reg.exe command modifying the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. This is setting the default icon and the command for opening Discord. That seems normal for a regular installation, but I need to check if there's any unusual parameters. The command line shows the path to the Discord executable, which is in the AppData folder. That's typical for user-installed applications.\n\nThen there are several entries of Discord.exe being accessed, creating pipes, and network connections. Creating multiple pipes might be normal for inter-process communication, but the repetition could be a sign of something. However, Discord does use network connections for its services, so that's expected.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set by reg.exe. The command line here adds a shell command for Discord, which again seems normal. But maybe the way it's being added is suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe most suspicious part might be the process creation of Discord.exe with a long command line that includes parameters like --type=utility and --utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper. This could indicate that Discord is being used to unzip files, which is not typical for a regular application. The presence of --secure-schemes and other flags might be normal, but the unzip parameter is a red flag. Also, the path to the executable is in the AppData folder, which is common, but the command line arguments are unusual.\n\nThen there's an image loaded event for ffmpeg.dll. While ffmpeg is a legitimate library, its presence in the context of Discord might be unexpected unless the user is using features that require it. However, the file is in the AppData directory, which could be a sign of a legitimate installation or a potential malicious payload.\n\nAnother event shows a file executable detected for Google.Widevine.CDM.dll in the Temp folder. Widevine is a DRM system, but the fact that it's being executed from the Temp directory might be suspicious. Legitimate software usually places such files in more standard directories.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of registry modifications, unusual command line arguments, and execution of files from the Temp directory could indicate a potential security issue. However, since Discord is a legitimate application, some of these events might be normal. The key is whether the activities are consistent with normal Discord behavior. The presence of multiple network connections, pipe creations, and the unzip parameter might suggest that something is being unpacked or executed, which could be malicious. But without more context or known indicators of compromise, it's a bit ambiguous. I need to check if these activities align with typical Discord operations. If the user has installed Discord normally, some of these events are expected. However, the Temp file execution and the unzip parameter might still be concerning. It's possible that this is a legitimate process, but the logs do show some elements that could be indicative of a security threat. Therefore, further investigation would be needed to confirm if this is malicious or just normal application behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs show activity related to the **Discord** application, with a mix of **legitimate** and **potentially suspicious** behaviors. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Registry Modifications (Potential Indicator of Interest)**\n- **`reg.exe`** is used to modify the registry under `HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord`, setting the default icon and command for launching Discord.\n  - **Legitimate Context**: This is typical during software installation or configuration.\n  - **Suspicious Aspect**: While not inherently malicious, **registry modifications** can sometimes be used to **persist malware** or **redirect execution paths**. Further context (e.g., user consent, source of the registry changes) is needed to assess risk.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Discord.exe Activity (Mixed Signals)**\n- **Repeated Process Creation\/Access**: Multiple entries show `Discord.exe` being accessed, creating pipes, and executing network connections.\n  - **Legitimate Context**: Discord is a communication tool that uses **network connections** and **inter-process communication (pipes)** for its core functionality.\n  - **Suspicious Aspects**:\n    - **Unusual Command-Line Arguments**: The process creation includes flags like `--type=utility` and `--utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper`, which are **uncommon for a regular Discord session**. This could indicate **unauthorized unpacking or execution** of files.\n    - **Execution of `ffmpeg.dll`**: The log shows `ffmpeg.dll` being loaded. While `ffmpeg` is a legitimate library, its presence in the context of Discord (which is not traditionally associated with video encoding) may warrant further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **3. File Execution from Temp Directory (High Risk)**\n- **Event**: A file named `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` is executed from the **`C:\\Users\\...Temp\\`** directory.\n  - **Legitimate Context**: `Widevine` is a DRM system used by some media platforms. However, **execution from the Temp directory** is often associated with **malware** or **suspicious payloads**.\n  - **Suspicious Aspect**: If this file is not part of a known, legitimate software (e.g., Chrome or YouTube), it could be **malicious** or **downloaded without user consent**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Image Load Events (Potential Red Flags)**\n- **`ffmpeg.dll` and `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll`** are loaded as part of the process.\n  - **Legitimate Context**: These files are used by some applications for media processing or DRM.\n  - **Suspicious Aspect**: The **absence of clear user context** (e.g., user initiating media playback) and **execution from non-standard paths** (e.g., Temp directory) raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Network Connections (Normal for Discord, but Context Matters)**\n- **Multiple network connections** are logged for `Discord.exe`.\n  - **Legitimate Context**: Discord requires network connectivity for chat, voice, and data transfer.\n  - **Suspicious Aspect**: If **unusual domains** or **high volumes of traffic** are observed, this could indicate **data exfiltration** or **malicious communication**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Summary of Risk Assessment**\n| Activity | Legitimate? | Suspicious? | Risk |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|------|\n| Registry modifications | Yes | Yes (if unauthorized) | Low-Medium |\n| Unusual command-line args | Yes (for utility features) | Yes | Medium |\n| Execution from Temp directory | No | Yes | High |\n| Loading `ffmpeg.dll`\/`Widevine` | Yes | Yes (context-dependent) | Medium |\n| Network connections | Yes | Yes (if anomalous) | Low-Medium |\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate Temp Directory Files**:\n   - Verify the legitimacy of `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` and its source.\n   - Check for **unauthorized installations** or **malware signatures** in the file.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**:\n   - Determine if the `--unzip` parameter is part of a **known Discord feature** or a **tampered executable**.\n\n3. **Monitor Network Traffic**:\n   - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Zscaler** to inspect the **domains** and **data** being transmitted by `Discord.exe`.\n\n4. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a **full system scan** with up-to-date antivirus tools.\n   - Use **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to check for **behavioral anomalies**.\n\n5. **User Context**:\n   - Confirm if the user **intended to install or use Discord** and whether **unusual behavior** was observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., network connections, registry updates) aligns with **normal Discord operation**, the **execution of files from the Temp directory** and **unusual command-line parameters** raise **red flags**. Further investigation is required to determine if this is **malicious activity** or a **legitimate but uncommon use case**."}

Normally, applications like Discord would have network activity, but if it's happening repeatedly in a short period, that could indicate something unusual. However, I should check if there's any other suspicious activity. The other events are ProcessTerminate and RegistryEvent, but they are also related to Discord.exe. \n\nWait, but if Discord is terminating itself and modifying the registry, maybe that's part of normal operations. However, the high number of network connections might still be concerning. But since all events are from a legitimate process, maybe it's just normal behavior. However, the high frequency of NetworkConnect events could be a sign of data exfiltration or communication with a C2 server. But without more context, like IP addresses or unusual destinations, it's hard to tell. \n\nOn the other hand, if Discord is just running normally, it's expected to have network connections. The user might be using Discord actively. But the same process terminating and modifying the registry could be part of updates or normal operations. \n\nSince all the events are from a legitimate application and there's no indication of malware or unusual activity beyond the normal network connections, maybe this isn't interesting. But the repetition might still be worth looking into. However, without additional info, it's hard to classify as definitely malicious. So, maybe the classification is not interesting because the events are from a legitimate process and don't show clear signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Discord.exe process performing normal operations (network connections, process termination, registry modifications). No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
