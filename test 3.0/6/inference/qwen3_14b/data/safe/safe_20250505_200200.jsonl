{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe creating a file at .winlogbeat.yml.new. That's a normal configuration file for Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe part of setting up the tool. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed, but no file path. Then ssh.exe making a network connection. That could be normal if someone is using SSH, but maybe suspicious if unexpected.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file again. Maybe it's a configuration change or a reinitialization. Then, powershell.exe is involved several times. There's a process create event for PowerShell, which is common, but then image loads of various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so that's normal for PowerShell scripts.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1. Creating and deleting a temporary script file might be part of a legitimate process, like testing script policies. However, sometimes attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection. But in this case, the filename suggests it's related to PowerShell script policy testing, which could be part of a legitimate administrative task.\n\nAlso, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell. These events are related to the PowerShell engine's lifecycle, which might be normal during script execution. However, the repetition of these events could indicate something unusual, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the network connection from ssh.exe. If this is a user's normal activity, it's fine. But if ssh.exe isn't typically used on this system, that might be a red flag. However, the logs don't provide information about the destination of the connection, so it's hard to assess.\n\nThe presence of multiple FileCreate and FileDelete events for temporary files could be part of normal operations, but the fact that a script is created and then deleted might be worth looking into. Also, the fact that Winlogbeat is creating configuration files multiple times might indicate a misconfiguration or a potential issue with the tool.\n\nHowever, there's no evidence of malicious activity here. All the processes involved (winlogbeat, powershell, ssh) are legitimate. The events don't show any unusual command-line arguments, unexpected network connections to suspicious IPs, or any signs of privilege escalation. The files created are either configuration files or temporary scripts related to PowerShell policy testing.\n\nSo, while some events might be a bit unusual (like the repeated file creation and deletion), they don't necessarily indicate a security threat. It's possible that the user is performing legitimate administrative tasks, testing script policies, or configuring Winlogbeat. Without additional context or indicators of compromise, these events might not be significant enough to warrant an investigation. But it's something to monitor, especially if similar events occur more frequently or in combination with other suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events observed does not strongly indicate malicious activity, but there are **moderate indicators of potential interest** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Benign Activity (Likely Normal)**\n- **Winlogbeat Configuration File Creation**:  \n  Multiple entries show `winlogbeat.exe` creating `.winlogbeat.yml.new` (a configuration file). This is **expected behavior** during Winlogbeat setup or reinitialization. No suspicious command-line arguments or unusual file paths are noted.\n\n- **PowerShell Execution with .NET DLLs**:  \n  PowerShell processes loading `.NET` runtime DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) are **normal** for script execution. These are standard components of the .NET framework.\n\n- **SSH Network Connection**:  \n  `ssh.exe` initiating a network connection is **common** for legitimate remote access or DevOps workflows. However, the **destination IP\/domain** is not logged, so this alone is inconclusive.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Interesting Activity**\n- **Temporary Script File Creation and Deletion**:  \n  A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory and immediately deleted. While the filename suggests **script policy testing** (a legitimate administrative task), this pattern is also **commonly used by malware** to evade detection.  \n  - **Why it matters**:  \n    - The file is created and deleted **quickly**, which could indicate an attempt to avoid leaving traces.  \n    - The script name includes a random string (`raz5sdjq`), which might suggest automation or obfuscation.\n\n- **Repetitive \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:  \n  Multiple PowerShell \"Engine Lifecycle\" events are logged. While this is **normal during script execution**, the **frequency** and lack of context (e.g., script content, user intent) could indicate **unusual automation** or **unauthorized activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. No Clear Malicious Indicators**\n- **No Suspicious IPs\/Hosts**:  \n  No network connections to known malicious IPs or domains are logged.  \n- **No Privilege Escalation**:  \n  No events suggest elevation of privileges (e.g., `secretsdump`, `PsExec`, etc.).  \n- **No File Tampering**:  \n  The deleted script is **not associated with known malicious payloads** (e.g., no references to `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**:  \n  Check if the temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) is linked to other events (e.g., process execution, network activity, or registry changes).  \n- **Monitor PowerShell Scripting**:  \n  Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** to analyze script content or detect obfuscation.  \n- **Review User Context**:  \n  Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) is authorized to perform script policy testing or SSH operations.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but the **creation and deletion of a temporary script** and **repetitive PowerShell activity** are **moderately suspicious**. These could be part of **legitimate administrative tasks** (e.g., testing script policies), but they also align with **malicious patterns** (e.g., evading detection). **Further analysis** is recommended to rule out compromise.  \n\n**Verdict**: **Low to Moderate Risk** â€“ Investigate the temporary script and PowerShell activity for context."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Both events are about files being created by svchost.exe in the XboxLive directory under the systemprofile's AppData. The first entry is a directory, and the second is a specific file, AuthStateCache.dat.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also a common vector for malware because attackers can inject malicious code into it. The fact that two files are being created in the XboxLive folder might be normal if it's part of a legitimate application, like Xbox-related services. But why are these files being created? The first entry is a directory, which is usually created once, and the second is a file that might be part of the application's normal operation.\n\nWait, but the justification for being interesting would be if there's something suspicious. However, in this case, the activity seems to be within a legitimate user profile directory. The XboxLive folder is part of the system profile, which is expected for certain applications. Also, the file names don't look like typical malware files. There's no mention of any other suspicious activities like network connections, unusual process behavior, or other security events. The confidence here is low because the events alone don't indicate malicious activity. They might be part of normal operations, so the classification is likely not interesting. But I should check if there's any pattern or if multiple events in the same location could be a red flag. However, with only two events and no other context, it's hard to say. So the conclusion is that it's not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show svchost.exe creating files in a legitimate system directory (XboxLive) under the systemprofile AppData. This is consistent with normal Windows application behavior and lacks indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
