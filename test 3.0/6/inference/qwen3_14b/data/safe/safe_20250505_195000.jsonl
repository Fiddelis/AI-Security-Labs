{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: SDXHelper.exe is loading several DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These are legitimate Windows DLLs, so that might not be a problem. But then I notice that SDXHelper.exe is making multiple DNS queries. That's a bit odd because while DNS queries are normal, a high number of them could indicate something like command and control traffic. But I need to check how many times it's happening here.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries where SDXHelper.exe is performing Dns query (rule: DnsQuery). There are about 8 instances of that. That's a lot. Even if it's a legitimate process, making that many DNS queries might be a red flag. Also, the process name SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a third-party application, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that it's repeatedly querying DNS could be indicative of malicious activity, like exfiltrating data or communicating with a C2 server.\n\nThen there's the PowerShell activity. The logs show PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell's operation. But there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be related to script execution. However, the deletion of the file after creation could be part of a normal process, but it's something to note. Also, the Pipe Created event might be part of legitimate PowerShell operations, but again, could be used maliciously.\n\nAnother thing is that the user is using winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The log entry about the file created in the Downloads directory for winlogbeat might be normal if they're setting up the tool, but not necessarily suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of events. SDXHelper.exe's multiple DNS queries stand out. If this is a benign process, it's unusual to see so many DNS queries. Also, the fact that the same process is loading DLLs and making DNS queries could be part of a larger pattern. The presence of PowerShell activities might be related to scripting, but unless there are commands that are suspicious, it's hard to say. However, the repeated DNS queries by SDXHelper.exe are more concerning.\n\nI should check if there are any other anomalies. The services.exe and taskhostw.exe events are normal system processes, so they don't seem suspicious. The registry changes by svchost.exe and Explorer.EXE might be part of normal operations, but without more context on what registry keys were changed, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flag is the high number of DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe. That's a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some of the other events are normal, the combination of repeated DNS queries from a non-standard process is enough to flag this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains **multiple suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation, particularly focusing on the **repeated DNS queries** and **unusual process behavior**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **High Volume of DNS Queries from `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **8 instances** of `SDXHelper.exe` performing `DnsQuery` (rule: `DnsQuery`).\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Windows process, and its repeated DNS activity could indicate **C2 communication**, **data exfiltration**, or **malicious reconnaissance**.\n   - Normal processes typically do not perform this many DNS queries unless explicitly configured for a legitimate purpose (e.g., a custom application), which is not indicated here.\n\n2. **Unusual File Operations via PowerShell:**\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1`) is **created and immediately deleted** in the `Temp` directory. While this could be part of a legitimate script execution, it may also indicate **obfuscation or cleanup** after malicious activity.\n   - The presence of `Pipe Created` events (rule: `PipeEvent`) could be related to **inter-process communication (IPC)**, which is common in PowerShell but may be exploited in attacks.\n\n3. **Lack of Context for `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - No metadata or process tree context is provided to confirm whether `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate application (e.g., a third-party tool) or a **malicious payload**.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious but Noteworthy:**\n- **PowerShell DLL Loads:** Loading DLLs like `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) and .NET components is **normal** for PowerShell execution.\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation:** The temporary file created for Winlogbeat is likely **legitimate** if the user is configuring the log shipper, but should be cross-verified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **highly suspicious** and requires further investigation. The **repeated DNS queries from `SDXHelper.exe`** and **anomalous file operations** suggest potential **malicious activity**. Immediate actions should include:\n- Checking the **process tree** of `SDXHelper.exe` to identify its origin and parent processes.\n- Analyzing **network traffic** associated with the DNS queries (e.g., domain destinations, frequency, timing).\n- Investigating the **PowerShell script** (if available) to determine its purpose.\n- Verifying whether `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate application or a **dropped payload**.\n\n**Recommendation:** Flag this for deeper analysis by a security team or SOC."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with PowerShell.exe being executed, and the task is \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". Normally, PowerShell is a common tool, but if it's being used repeatedly for certain tasks, that might be suspicious. However, just seeing PowerShell alone isn't necessarily malicious. The logs don't show any unusual command-line arguments here, just the default path. So maybe not too concerning yet.\n\nThen, there's an entry where PowerShell loads \"MpClient.dll\" from the Windows Defender directory. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender uses that DLL. Another entry shows loading \"urlmon.dll\", which is part of Internet Explorer and used for URL handling. These are both normal system files, so probably not a red flag.\n\nNext, there's \"HxTsr.exe\" setting a registry value. I'm not familiar with that executable off the top of my head. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the task here is \"Registry value set\", which is a common activity, so maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are entries related to Python. The user runs \"py.exe\" and \"python.exe\", which is normal if they're using Python for scripting. The logs show process creation and image loading for Python and its dependencies. These are all standard DLLs that Python requires, like vcruntime140.dll and python313.dll. So that seems legitimate. The presence of Python might be part of the user's normal activities, like development or automation.\n\nThere's also \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating a configuration file (.winlogbeat.yml.new), that's part of its normal operation. But the fact that it's creating a file in the Downloads folder might be a bit odd. Typically, configuration files would be in a more standard location, but maybe the user is setting it up manually. Not sure yet, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's \"SDXHelper.exe\" performing DNS queries. Again, without knowing what SDXHelper is, it's hard to say. If it's part of a legitimate application, then it's normal. But if it's an unknown or suspicious application, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't provide much context about this process.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, the majority of the events seem to be normal system and application activities. PowerShell and Python are both common, and the DLLs loaded are standard. The registry changes and DNS queries are also typical for various applications. The only potential red flags might be the \"HxTsr.exe\" and \"SDXHelper.exe\" processes, but without more information or additional suspicious activities, they don't stand out as malicious.\n\nHowever, the repeated entries for PowerShell with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks might be worth noting. If this is part of a larger pattern of unusual PowerShell activity, it could be a sign of something malicious. But on its own, with no other indicators like unusual command-line arguments or network activity, it's not conclusive.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are a few unusual processes, the overall batch doesn't show clear signs of a security threat. It's more likely to be normal system and user activities. So, I'd say this isn't particularly interesting for investigation unless there's more context or additional suspicious events not shown here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of normal system and user activities, with no clear evidence of malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show `PowerShell.exe` executing with tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle.\" These are standard operations for PowerShell and do not indicate suspicious behavior unless accompanied by unusual command-line arguments (not present here).\n\n2. **Legitimate DLL Loads:**\n   - PowerShell loads `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender) and `urlmon.dll` (Internet Explorer), both legitimate system components. No signs of malicious code injection or unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **Python Execution:**\n   - Processes like `py.exe` and `python.exe` are standard for scripting or automation. The loaded DLLs (e.g., `vcruntime140.dll`, `python313.dll`) are legitimate Python dependencies. No anomalies detected.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates a configuration file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`) in the Downloads directory. While non-standard, this could be part of manual configuration or setup. No direct security threat unless tied to other suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Unusual Processes:**\n   - **`HxTsr.exe`** and **`SDXHelper.exe`** are not widely recognized, but their activities (registry changes, DNS queries) are not inherently malicious. Further investigation would be needed to confirm their legitimacy.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **No immediate security threats** are evident. The logs reflect typical system operations (e.g., PowerShell, Python, Winlogbeat) and benign process interactions.\n- **Potential areas for further scrutiny**:\n  - Unusual processes (`HxTsr.exe`, `SDXHelper.exe`) if their origins or behaviors are unclear.\n  - Repeated PowerShell activity if tied to other suspicious indicators (e.g., obfuscated scripts, lateral movement).\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Monitor** the uncharacteristic processes (`HxTsr.exe`, `SDXHelper.exe`) for additional context (e.g., file paths, parent processes).\n- **Correlate** with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user behavior) to rule out stealthy attacks.\n- **No action required** at this time, as the logs do not indicate a clear security incident.\n\n**Final Verdict:** *Not interesting for investigation at this stage.*"}
