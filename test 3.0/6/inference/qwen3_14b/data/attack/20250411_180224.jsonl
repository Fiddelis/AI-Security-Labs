{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' activity. One of the entries shows a command line that uses 'schtasks' to create a scheduled task with the command 'cmd \/c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The path here is a non-existing script, which might be a red flag. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is unusual and could indicate a persistent backdoor.\n\nAnother entry has 'schtasks.exe' creating a task with a similar command, pointing to another non-existing script. The fact that the scripts don't exist might mean the attacker is trying to execute commands directly without a file, or maybe they're planning to deploy the script later. \n\nThere's also a 'File created' event for '.winlogbeat.yml.new' and some text files, but those might be benign unless they contain malicious content. However, the main concern here is the scheduled tasks and the use of PowerShell with bypassed execution policies. \n\nThe repeated 'Registry value set' events for 'chrome.exe' and 'svchost.exe' could be normal, but when combined with the scheduled tasks, it might indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes. \n\nThe 'whoami.exe' command is standard for checking user context, but in this case, it's part of a larger pattern of activities that seem to be setting up a scheduled task with elevated privileges. \n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell, using the system account, and bypassing execution policies is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high, but not 100% certain without more context. However, the presence of these elements makes the batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell commands using -ep bypass (indicative of bypassing execution policies), non-existing script paths suggesting potential malicious intent, and repeated registry modifications. These patterns are commonly associated with adversarial behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
