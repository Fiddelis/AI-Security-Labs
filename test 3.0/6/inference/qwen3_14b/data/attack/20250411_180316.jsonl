Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe with Registry value set events. Those are normal processes, maybe just regular operations. Then there's powershell.exe with Process accessed, which could be benign or malicious. But then calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, but loading it from System32 seems normal. However, I notice that Calculator.exe is mentioned here, which might be a typo or a different process. \n\nLooking further, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably normal, but the path is in the Downloads folder. Then, whoami.exe is run, which is a standard command to check user context. But then there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems suspicious because deleting processes might be part of a cleanup after an attack. \n\nThen, WMIC.exe is involved in creating processes and loading dlls like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are part of Windows Defender, but loading them might be normal. However, the use of WMIC to delete processes is a red flag. Also, multiple instances of powershell.exe and Process accessed events could indicate someone trying to manipulate processes. \n\nI also notice that some events have the same process names but different tasks. The combination of wmic commands, process deletions, and multiple registry changes might suggest an attempt to hide activities or tamper with the system. Even though some processes are legitimate, the pattern of events, especially the deletion of notepad.exe processes and the use of WMIC, points towards potential malicious activity. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any clear evidence of compromise.

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. Now, some of these might be normal, but I need to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nWait, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like someone is copying a backup executable to a system file. That's a red flag because sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys executable, and replacing it with a backup could be part of a malicious activity, like a backdoor.\n\nAnother line has \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", which is deleting a scheduled task. Maybe the attacker was trying to remove traces of their own scheduled tasks. Also, there's a process create event for schtasks.exe with the command line to delete the task. That seems suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used, and registry value sets. While PowerShell and CMD are common, the combination with registry changes and scheduled task deletions might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or hide their activities.\n\nAdditionally, the 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times could be part of reconnaissance, checking user privileges. The 'conhost.exe' and 'svchost.exe' entries might be normal, but the frequency and combination with other events could be concerning.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any clear malicious activity. The copy command replacing sethc.exe is a known technique used in attacks, like the \"Sticky Keys\" backdoor. Also, deleting a scheduled task might be an attempt to remove evidence. The repeated use of PowerShell and CMD with registry changes could be part of a larger attack.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of these specific commands and the combination of events suggest potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. First, I need to look for any suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Image loaded, Process accessed, and File created. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the file paths in the Image loaded events. For example, there's a reference to 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll'. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, but why is it being loaded by chrome.exe and powershell.exe? That might be normal, but I should check if there are any other unusual paths.\n\nAnother entry is the File created event with a path in the Temp directory: 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1'. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like a script that's testing execution policies. However, the presence of a script in the Temp folder could be a red flag, especially if it's being created by PowerShell. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is normal for checking user context. The PowerShell processes have commands like '& {}', which is a no-op, but maybe part of a larger script. The repetition of Process accessed and Registry value set events might indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to overreact. Some of these events could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll is normal during script execution. The Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be part of legitimate security operations.\n\nBut the combination of multiple PowerShell processes creating a temporary script file, along with frequent registry changes and process accesses, might suggest an attempt to execute malicious code or bypass security measures. The Temp file creation is particularly concerning because it's a common tactic for malware to drop payloads there.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators, like unexpected network activity or unusual process trees, but those aren't present here. The logs don't show any obvious malicious payloads or network connections. \n\nConsidering all this, while some activities are normal, the combination of the Temp file creation and the multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe events might warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a File Delete logged by powershell.exe, deleting a script file in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because deleting a script might be part of cleaning up after an attack. But maybe it's just a normal operation? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. The command line is 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an empty command. Those might be benign, but maybe they're part of some automated process or a script that's not doing anything. However, having multiple similar events could indicate something's wrong, like a loop or a failed attempt.\n\nLooking further, there's a File created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably normal, part of its operation. Then another File created by powershell.exe in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which could be used for persistence. Not sure yet, but worth noting.\n\nThere's also a Registry value set by powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malware configuration, but again, could be legitimate. The Process accessed events might indicate someone trying to manipulate processes, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are several PowerShell commands checking for the existence of various .bat files in different paths. The paths have some odd names with lots of underscores and slashes, like \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\". The use of '..' suggests they're navigating directories, maybe trying to access files in parent directories. The scripts have names like 'objeto_ativo_script.bat' which might be part of a larger attack, but again, could be a legitimate script if the user is doing something specific.\n\nThe repeated PowerShell commands checking for these .bat files might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files exist, possibly for conditional execution. If those files aren't present, the script exits with 1, which could be part of a larger malicious payload that's conditional on certain files being present. However, without seeing the actual content of those .bat files, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell events with different tasks (File Delete, File Create, Registry changes) might indicate some form of lateral movement or data exfiltration. However, the majority of the events don't show obvious signs of malicious activity. The key thing here is the combination of events: a file deletion in Temp, followed by multiple checks for .bat files in various locations. This could be part of a multi-stage attack where the initial script is deleted, and then the attacker checks for other files to proceed.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. The winlogbeat event is normal. The other PowerShell commands are checking for files, which could be part of a legitimate script, but the repetition and the specific paths might be indicative of something else. Also, the use of 'Test-Path' with those long, non-standard paths might be a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious parts are the file deletion in Temp, the multiple Test-Path commands for .bat files in unusual paths, and the repeated PowerShell events. These could be signs of an attacker trying to clean up after initial access and then probing the system for other entry points or files to execute. However, without more context or additional logs (like process creation, network activity, etc.), it's a bit hard to confirm. But given the combination, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though they may not definitively indicate malicious activity without additional context. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **File Deletion in Temporary Directory**:\n   - A PowerShell process deletes a script file (`objeto_ativo_script.bat`) in the system's **Temp directory**. While temporary files can be legitimate, deletion of scripts in this context may indicate cleanup after initial exploitation or obfuscation of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Repetitive `Test-Path` Commands**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `.bat` files in non-standard, deeply nested paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral\\registro_auxiliar\\..`). The paths contain:\n     - **Unusual naming conventions** (e.g., `modulo_geral`, `estrutura_geral`), which may hint at obfuscation or deliberate misdirection.\n     - **Parent directory navigation** (`..`), suggesting attempts to access files in higher-level directories, potentially to bypass restrictions or locate hidden payloads.\n\n3. **Conditional Execution**:\n   - The scripts exit with `exit 0` or `exit 1` based on whether the target `.bat` files exist. This could indicate **conditional execution logic** (e.g., triggering further actions if specific files are present), which is common in multi-stage attacks or payloads.\n\n4. **High Volume of PowerShell Activity**:\n   - The logs include repeated PowerShell events with tasks like **Registry modifications**, **file creation\/deletion**, and **lifecycle events**. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, such repetitive activity could signal **automation**, **exploitation**, or **persistence mechanisms**.\n\n5. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - The `.bat` files referenced in `Test-Path` commands are located in directories with names that appear **non-standard** or **localized** (e.g., `modulo_geral`, `estrutura_geral`). This may indicate **language-specific obfuscation** or **custom directory structures** used to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Hypotheses**\n- **Initial Access & Cleanup**: The deleted script in the Temp directory could be part of an attacker's attempt to **remove evidence** of initial compromise (e.g., a dropped payload).\n- **Persistence or Lateral Movement**: The `Test-Path` checks might be probing for **existing malicious files** or **entry points** to execute further commands (e.g., checking for user-specific scripts or misconfigurations).\n- **Obfuscation**: The use of non-English directory names and repetitive commands may be **designed to evade signature-based detection** or mimic legitimate scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Logs**:\n   - Check for **process creation events**, **network activity**, or **file modifications** related to the `.bat` files referenced in `Test-Path` commands.\n   - Investigate the **origin** of the PowerShell commands (e.g., parent processes, user context).\n\n2. **Analyze the `.bat` Files**:\n   - If the `.bat` files are found, examine their contents for **malicious payloads**, **command-line arguments**, or **references to external resources**.\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies in PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Monitor for **unusual PowerShell modules**, **script block logging**, or **uncommon verbs** (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`).\n\n4. **Review Registry Changes**:\n   - Investigate the **Registry keys modified** by PowerShell to determine if they relate to **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., Run keys, scheduled tasks).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs exhibit **patterned behavior** that could indicate **malicious activity**, particularly around **file probing, cleanup, and conditional execution**. While these actions are not inherently malicious, their repetition and context (e.g., Temp directory deletion, obfuscated paths) justify further scrutiny. A deeper dive into process trees, network traffic, and file contents is necessary to confirm or rule out a security incident."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The first event shows a process creation with a command line that checks if a certain batch file exists. The exit codes are 0 or 1 based on that. Then there are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events. The image loaded events include some .dll files from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and then immediately deleting it might be a red flag. Maybe the script was executed temporarily and then cleaned up. But why would someone do that? It could be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers do this to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events from chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry could be normal, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious. However, the logs don't show the specific registry keys, so it's hard to tell without more info.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of 'Engine Lifecycle' events. The command lines here are similar to the first one, checking for the existence of different batch files. This pattern might indicate that the PowerShell scripts are part of some automated checks or setup processes. However, if these scripts are part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of certain files before executing malicious code, that could be a concern.\n\nThe presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be normal, but sometimes attackers try to bypass or interact with antivirus components. However, just loading those DLLs isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThe file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory might be related to PowerShell profiles. If that's a legitimate configuration, it's okay, but if it's being used to inject malicious code, that's a problem. However, the log only shows the file creation, not its content.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes, creating and deleting temporary scripts, loading various DLLs, and registry changes. While some of these activities are normal, the combination might indicate something suspicious, especially the temporary script creation and deletion. However, without more context or evidence of malicious activity (like unusual commands, network traffic, or unauthorized access), it's hard to be certain. But enough to warrant further investigation. So, the answer is probably that it's interesting and needs more analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows **normal system activity** with some **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes are launched with commands checking for the existence of `.bat` files (e.g., `Test-Path`), which may be part of **legitimate conditional logic** (e.g., dependency checks). However, the repetitive nature of these checks (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`, etc.) raises questions about their purpose.\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created, which could be **legitimate** (e.g., configuration files) or **malicious** (e.g., stealthy execution). No content is visible in the logs.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A `.ps1` script (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and later deleted. This pattern is **common in malware** to avoid leaving traces, though it can also occur in legitimate scenarios (e.g., temporary execution).\n\n3. **Windows Defender DLLs**:\n   - Loading of `MpClient.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) is **normal**, but attackers sometimes interact with these modules to **bypass detection**. No evidence of malicious interaction is visible here.\n\n4. **Chrome Registry Modifications**:\n   - Chrome (`chrome.exe`) is associated with 18 `Registry value set` events. While this could be **legitimate** (e.g., updates, extensions), the lack of context (e.g., specific registry keys) makes it **ambiguous** and worth investigating further.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A `Pipe Created` event is logged, which could be part of **inter-process communication** (normal) or **malicious coordination** between processes. No additional details are provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Suspicious File Handling**: The creation and deletion of a `.ps1` script in a non-standard directory (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) may indicate **attempted obfuscation** or **post-exploitation activity**.\n- **Repetitive PowerShell Checks**: The repeated use of `Test-Path` with seemingly arbitrary file paths (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`) could be part of **custom scripts** or **malware probing for dependencies**.\n- **Lack of Context**: The absence of detailed command-line arguments (e.g., for `chrome.exe`) and network activity limits the ability to assess risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs shows **no definitive evidence of malicious activity**, but the **combination of PowerShell script handling, registry changes, and lack of context** raises **low-to-moderate suspicion**. Further investigation is recommended, including:\n- Analyzing the contents of the deleted `.ps1` script (if recoverable).\n- Correlating with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user behavior).\n- Checking for anomalies in Chrome's registry modifications.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for further analysis**, but not conclusive of malicious intent at this stage."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there's a lot of 'Registry value set' and 'Process Create' events. But the key thing here is the command_line in one of the entries. Let me check that again. Oh, there's a line where the command_line shows creating a new item and setting content to a batch file with the command \"dir\". Wait, that seems odd. Creating a batch file with just \"dir\" might be a placeholder, but the paths are all over the place, like C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\.. which could be trying to obfuscate the actual path. The use of .. might be to navigate up directories, but why would they do that? Maybe to hide the real location or to make it harder to track.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events with .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. But combined with PowerShell activities, it could indicate something is trying to use .NET for code execution, which is common in malware.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File created' event in the Temp directory. The file name is a random string, which is a common tactic for malware to leave temporary files that are hard to detect. The fact that it's in the AppData\\Local\\Temp folder is a red flag because that's a common place for malicious files.\n\nAlso, there are several entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. Those might be related to PowerShell's own processes, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they could indicate something is trying to manipulate the execution environment.\n\nNow, considering all these points: multiple PowerShell commands creating files with obfuscated paths, loading .NET assemblies, and creating temporary files with random names, this seems like a pattern that could be associated with malicious activity. Even though some of these actions could be legitimate, the combination and the obfuscation techniques used in the file paths make me think this is worth investigating further.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators, like unusual process trees, network activity, or user account involvement. But based on the given logs, the main red flags are the PowerShell command lines, the file creation in Temp, and the loading of .NET DLLs. So, yes, this batch of events is suspicious and should be flagged for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit multiple suspicious patterns indicative of potential malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n### 1. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage**\n   - **Command-Line Obfuscation**: Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating files with paths containing `..` (directory traversal) and arbitrary directory names (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..`). This obfuscation is commonly used to evade detection or hide the true intent of the script.\n   - **Suspicious File Creation**: A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory, a common location for malware to store transient malicious payloads.\n\n### 2. **Unusual .NET Assembly Loading**\n   - **Image Load Events**: The logs show PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscoreei.dll`. While these are legitimate .NET components, their presence in conjunction with PowerShell scripts may indicate the use of .NET for code execution (e.g., PowerShell remoting, reflective loading of malicious DLLs).\n\n### 3. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events**\n   - **Unusual Task Names**: The `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events are not standard for typical PowerShell usage. These could signal attempts to manipulate PowerShell's execution environment (e.g., bypassing execution policies or injecting code).\n\n### 4. **Lateral Movement or Persistence Indicators**\n   - The repeated creation of batch files with `dir` commands (a basic shell command) in non-standard paths may be a precursor to more complex operations, such as:\n     - **Persistence**: Establishing long-term access via scripts or registry entries.\n     - **Lateral Movement**: Using PowerShell to interact with remote systems or escalate privileges.\n\n### 5. **Contextual Red Flags**\n   - **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose**: The scripts do not appear to perform routine administrative tasks. The use of `New-Item` and `Set-Content` with obfuscated paths suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n   - **Unusual File Naming**: The temporary file name (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...`) mimics a benign PowerShell test script, which could be a social engineering tactic to disguise malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, anomalous .NET assembly loading, and the creation of transient files in sensitive directories strongly suggests **malicious intent** (e.g., initial access, persistence, or data exfiltration). Further analysis should include:\n- **Network Traffic Inspection** (for C2 communication).\n- **Process Tree Analysis** (to identify parent processes or unexpected execution chains).\n- **File Content Examination** (to confirm the presence of malicious payloads).\n\n**Recommendation**: Isolate the affected system, block suspicious network activity, and conduct a full forensic analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if they're relevant for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together, not individually. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like file creation, deletion, image loading, and registry changes. There are several instances where files are created or deleted in temporary directories or user-specific paths. For example, the first event is a file delete of a PowerShell script in the Temp folder. Then there's a file creation in C:\\componente_geral... which might be a common directory.\n\nI notice that multiple events have the 'File created' task, which could be normal, but when combined with other activities, it might indicate something. Also, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET framework DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe if there's an unusual DLL, but here they're all standard ones like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. So that's probably legitimate.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some of them are checking if certain files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. These might be part of scripts that are verifying the presence of files. However, the paths mentioned are a mix of system directories and some custom-looking paths like C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base... which might be part of an application's structure. But without knowing the context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nAnother thing is the number of events. There are multiple PowerShell processes creating files, modifying the registry, and loading images. However, none of the events seem to indicate obvious malicious activity like downloading from the internet, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive files. The files being created are .bat scripts, which could be benign or part of a legitimate process.\n\nBut wait, the first event deletes a script in the Temp directory. That's common for PowerShell scripts to clean up after themselves. The other file creations might be part of the same process. However, the repetition of similar command lines checking for the existence of files in different directories might be part of a larger script that's being run multiple times, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nAlso, the use of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events might be part of normal PowerShell operations. However, if these events are occurring in an unusual frequency or context, it could be a sign of something. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies. For example, if a user account is performing a lot of these actions, or if there's a high volume of file creations\/deletions. But in the given data, there's no mention of user accounts or timing, so I can't assess that.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are multiple PowerShell activities, they don't seem to indicate obvious malicious behavior. The events could be part of normal operations, especially if the system is running applications that use PowerShell scripts. However, the lack of clear indicators of compromise (like suspicious network activity, unusual commands, or access to sensitive files) makes it hard to label this as interesting. But maybe the fact that there are so many file creations and deletions in various directories could be a point of concern, warranting further investigation. However, based on the information provided, I think it's leaning towards not being a clear threat, but possibly needing more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves **PowerShell activities** with a mix of **file operations, registry changes, and .NET image loading**. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple **file creation\/deletion** events in temporary\/user-specific directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`), which is common for PowerShell scripts to clean up after execution.\n   - **Script checks** for file existence (e.g., `Test-Path`) with conditional exits (`exit 0\/1`). These are typical in legitimate scripts (e.g., pre-flight checks, dependency validation).\n\n2. **File Paths:**\n   - Files are created in **custom directories** (e.g., `C:\\modulo_comum\\...`, `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`), which could be part of application-specific logic or user-defined workflows. However, the lack of context makes it hard to determine if these paths are benign or suspicious.\n\n3. **Image Loading:**\n   - **.NET framework DLLs** (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are loaded, which is **expected behavior for PowerShell** when executing .NET-based scripts or modules.\n\n4. **No Clear IOC:**\n   - No **malicious indicators** (e.g., network connections to C2 servers, execution of obfuscated code, access to sensitive files, or elevation of privileges) are present.\n   - The **command-line arguments** are focused on file checks and do not involve suspicious commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process` with malicious payloads).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Likely Benign:** The events align with **normal PowerShell usage** for scripting tasks, such as file management, application setup, or automation. The absence of clear malicious activity (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration) reduces the urgency for immediate investigation.\n- **Context Needed:** If these events occur in an environment where **PowerShell is not routinely used** or if the files\/paths are associated with **unauthorized applications**, further analysis (e.g., checking user context, timing, or correlating with other logs) would be warranted.\n\n### **Verdict:**\n**Not Clearly Interesting** (benign behavior), but **monitoring** is recommended if PowerShell usage is atypical in the environment."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes. There's a lot of command lines that check if certain files exist using Test-Path, then exit 0 or 1. These paths have a pattern: they seem to be checking for .bat files in various directories with names like \"modulo_geral\", \"elemento_auxiliar\", etc. The structure of the paths is a bit odd, with parts like \"..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\" which might be navigating up directories. But I need to check if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there are some file creation and deletion events. For example, a temporary PowerShell script is created and then deleted. That's common in normal operations, but maybe if it's happening frequently or in unusual locations, it could be a red flag. However, in this case, it's just one instance.\n\nThere are also entries about image loaded (like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender), which are legitimate system files. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file is probably part of a monitoring tool, which is normal.\n\nOther events include registry value sets and process accesses, which are typical system activities. The whoami.exe command is just checking the user, which is harmless.\n\nLooking at all the PowerShell commands, they all seem to be checking for the existence of specific .bat files. If these files don't exist, the script exits with 1. But why would someone do that? Maybe they're trying to determine if certain files are present as part of a larger process, like checking for prerequisites before running a more complex script. However, the repetition of similar commands across different paths might indicate an automated check, possibly part of a legitimate application or a script that's trying to ensure dependencies are met.\n\nBut wait, the paths have a pattern that seems to be constructed with multiple levels of directories, some of which might be obfuscating the actual location. For example, the use of \"..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\" could be an attempt to make the path look more complex, which is sometimes done in malicious scripts to avoid detection. However, without seeing the actual content of the .bat files or other actions taken after these checks, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nAnother point is that all these checks are using PowerShell, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The fact that there are multiple instances of similar commands might suggest a scripted process, but again, without more context, it's hard to determine intent.\n\nConsidering the presence of Windows Defender modules and the temporary script being created and deleted, it's possible that this is part of a normal system operation or a benign script. However, the repetitive nature of the Test-Path commands could be a sign of something more, especially if these are part of a larger attack chain where the presence of certain files triggers further actions.\n\nBut since there's no evidence of malicious activity beyond the checks (like downloading files, executing other scripts, or modifying system settings), it's possible that this is just a series of legitimate checks. The key here is that the logs don't show any clear signs of exploitation or data exfiltration. They're just checking for files.\n\nSo, the main question is: are these checks suspicious on their own? In isolation, they might not be, but if they're part of a larger pattern or if the system is otherwise compromised, they could be part of a larger issue. However, based solely on the provided logs, the activity seems to be within normal operational boundaries, even though the repetitive checks might warrant further investigation to confirm their purpose.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs consist primarily of PowerShell commands checking for the existence of specific `.bat` files across various directories, with no clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripts with `Test-Path`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for `.bat` files in directories with obfuscated or nested paths (e.g., `..\\\\elemento_auxiliar`). These scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on the file's presence.\n   - **Potential Legitimacy:** Such checks could be part of a script ensuring dependencies exist before proceeding (e.g., verifying prerequisites for an application).\n   - **Suspicious Pattern:** The repetitive structure and use of nested directories may indicate obfuscation, though this alone is not conclusive.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`entrada_base.exe`) is created and deleted. This is common in benign scenarios (e.g., temporary execution).\n\n3. **Legitimate System Activity:**\n   - Entries involving Windows Defender modules (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and `winlogbeat.exe` (a monitoring tool) are normal.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Registry modifications and process access events are typical system operations and not inherently suspicious.\n\n5. **Lack of Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No evidence of data exfiltration, unauthorized downloads, or system modifications is present.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low Immediate Risk:** The logs do not show clear signs of exploitation or malicious intent. The activity appears to be routine or part of a legitimate process.\n- **Potential for Further Investigation:** The repetitive `Test-Path` commands and obfuscated paths may warrant closer scrutiny if:\n  - The system is part of a high-security environment.\n  - Additional anomalous activity (e.g., lateral movement, unexpected network traffic) is detected elsewhere.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **not clearly indicative of a security threat**. However, the repetitive nature of the PowerShell checks and obfuscated paths could be part of a larger process requiring contextual analysis (e.g., correlating with other logs, checking for hidden files, or monitoring for follow-up actions). **Further investigation is recommended** if the system is under active monitoring or if these patterns are part of a broader suspicious trend. \n\n**Verdict:** **Not immediately suspicious**, but **monitoring for additional context** is advised."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is running a command that checks if a specific file exists. The command line uses Test-Path to check for \"C:\\registro_ativo\\...\" and exits 0 or 1 based on that. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script that's verifying if a file is present. But why is this relevant? Well, sometimes attackers use similar checks to see if certain files are in place before proceeding with malicious activities.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Process accessed and Image loaded events. The Image loaded events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That's normal because PowerShell often uses these libraries. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Loading those might be part of legitimate processes, but it's worth noting if there's any unusual behavior around them.\n\nNext, there's a File created and then immediately deleted event. The file is a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1) in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of a script's normal operation, but sometimes attackers create temporary files to execute malicious code and then delete them to avoid leaving traces. However, the name here seems to be related to PowerShell script policy testing, which might be a legitimate process, like when PowerShell is checking execution policies.\n\nThere are also several entries with \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be part of PowerShell's normal operations. The command lines here are similar to the first one, checking for different file paths. These could be part of a script that's checking for the presence of various executables. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just a routine check.\n\nThe Registry value set events don't have specific details, so they might not be suspicious on their own. The whoami.exe process is also normal, as it's just retrieving user information. The cmd.exe process runs a command to check if a file exists in the temp directory, which is similar to the PowerShell checks. This could be part of a batch script that's checking for the presence of a file, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of these events seem to be part of normal system operations, like checking file existence, loading necessary libraries, and creating\/deleting temporary files. However, the repeated checks for specific files and the use of temporary files might be something to look into further. Attackers sometimes use similar techniques to check for the presence of tools or to execute payloads. But without more evidence, like unusual network activity, unexpected processes, or changes in the registry that aren't documented, it's hard to confirm malicious intent here.\n\nSo, the key points are: multiple file existence checks, temporary file creation and deletion, and loading of legitimate DLLs. These could be part of a legitimate process, but they might also be indicative of something more if there's a pattern or if other suspicious activities are present. Since the logs don't show clear signs of compromise, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation, I'd say this is a moderate risk. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough red flags that a security analyst should look into it more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of **normal system operations** and **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Recurring File Existence Checks**:\n   - PowerShell repeatedly checks for the existence of files (e.g., `registro_ativo\\...`, `objeto_auxiliar\\...`, `entrada_auxiliar.exe`) using commands like `Test-Path`. \n   - **Potential Concern**: These checks could be part of **legitimate scripts** (e.g., pre-flight checks), but they may also be used by attackers to verify the presence of tools or payloads before executing them.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and later deleted. Another file (`objeto_logico.txt`) is checked for existence via `cmd.exe`.\n   - **Potential Concern**: While temporary files are common in scripting, **creation and deletion of files with obfuscated\/names** (e.g., `objeto_logico.txt`) could indicate **attempts to evade detection**.\n\n3. **Legitimate DLL Loading**:\n   - PowerShell loads standard DLLs (e.g., `.NET`, `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender). These are **normal** for PowerShell operations but may be **exploited in advanced attacks** (e.g., DLL hijacking).\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple **Registry value set** events are logged, but no specific keys or values are detailed. Without context, these are **ambiguous** and could relate to **legitimate configuration changes** or **malicious persistence mechanisms**.\n\n5. **Command-Line Activity**:\n   - The `cmd.exe` process runs a script to check if `objeto_logico.txt` exists. This is a **common administrative task** but could also be part of **malicious scripting** (e.g., conditional execution of payloads).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**:\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity**: **Low to Moderate**. \n  - The logs do not show clear signs of compromise (e.g., network connections to C2 servers, unauthorized binaries, or privilege escalation).\n  - However, the **recurring file checks** and **temporary file handling** are **consistent with adversarial techniques** used in **initial access** and **lateral movement** phases.\n\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n  - **Unusual File Paths**: Paths like `C:\\registro_ativo\\...` or `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...` may be **custom or obfuscated** (though not necessarily malicious).\n  - **Lack of Context**: Without additional logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity), it's challenging to confirm intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Data Sources**:\n   - Check **network logs** for unusual outbound connections (e.g., to known malicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Review **user activity** (e.g., login times, privilege levels) to determine if these actions align with **expected behavior**.\n\n2. **Analyze File Content**:\n   - If `objeto_logico.txt` or the temporary PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) exist on disk, **examine their contents** for malicious code (e.g., encoded payloads, obfuscation).\n\n3. **Monitor for Persistence**:\n   - Investigate **Registry changes** for signs of persistence (e.g., startup entries, scheduled tasks).\n\n4. **Check for PowerShell Logging**:\n   - Enable **PowerShell transcript logging** or **ETW tracing** to capture more detailed context around these commands.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile the logs **do not confirm a breach**, the **recurring file checks** and **temporary file behavior** are **notable deviations** from typical system activity. These patterns should be **investigated further** to rule out adversarial activity. The risk is **moderate**, and additional forensic analysis is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe. That's common, but I know that PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious purposes. There are multiple entries where 'Process accessed' is logged, which might be normal, but the repetition could be a red flag. Then there's 'cmd.exe' and 'whoami.exe' being used. Whoami.exe is usually benign, just checks the user context, but when combined with other commands, it might be part of something more.\n\nWait, there are a few instances where the command_line parameter is present. For example, the PowerShell commands are checking if certain files exist. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\...\" don't look standard. They have a lot of \"src\" directories and .cs files, which are C# source files. That's unusual. Why would someone be checking for the existence of these files? Maybe they're trying to see if certain directories are present as part of a setup or installation, but in a malicious context, it could be checking for the presence of a payload or a configuration file.\n\nThen there's the 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms. If an attacker is modifying the registry to ensure their malware runs at startup or persists across reboots, that's a bad sign. However, there's only one entry for that here, so maybe not conclusive on its own.\n\nAnother thing to note is the 'Image loaded' events. The DLLs being loaded are all part of the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate, but if there are unexpected or unknown DLLs, that's a problem. Here, the DLLs are standard, so maybe not a direct indicator of malware, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger picture.\n\nLooking at the 'Provider Lifecycle' events, they're associated with PowerShell commands that check for the existence of specific files. The paths mentioned are all in different directories and have similar naming patterns. This might be part of a script that's trying to locate or verify certain files, possibly as part of a deployment or a check for the presence of a specific environment. However, if these files are not standard or are part of a malicious payload, that could be an issue.\n\nI need to consider the possibility of obfuscation. The use of multiple Test-Path commands in different directories might be an attempt to avoid detection. Also, the repetition of similar commands in different paths could indicate a script that's being run multiple times, perhaps as part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events with different paths might be part of a legitimate application's setup, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in a security context, any unusual or repetitive behavior with PowerShell and file checks should be investigated further.\n\nPutting it all together: while some of these activities are normal, the combination of frequent PowerShell usage, checking for non-standard files, and registry modifications could indicate a potential security threat. The lack of obvious malicious indicators like known malware hashes or network activity makes it a bit tricky, but the suspicious file paths and repeated checks might be enough to flag this for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, as they may indicate **malicious activity** or **unusual behavior** that could be part of an attack chain. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage**:\n   - **Repeated `Test-Path` Commands**: PowerShell scripts repeatedly check for the existence of files in non-standard, obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\...` and `C:\\estrutura_comum\\objeto_padrao\\...`). These paths resemble **C# source files** (`.cs`) and lack clear purpose, which is unusual in legitimate scenarios. This could indicate:\n     - **File existence checks** for payloads, configuration files, or staging directories.\n     - **Obfuscation** to avoid detection by static analysis.\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - The paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\...`) are non-standard and lack clear association with typical system or application directories. This could suggest **custom malware** or **setup scripts** for malicious tools.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - A single log entry for **\"Registry value set\"** (via `cmd.exe`) could indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries). While isolated, this may be part of a broader strategy to ensure post-exploitation access.\n\n4. **Repetitive \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands with similar structures (e.g., `Test-Path` checks) are logged under **\"Provider Lifecycle\"**, which is typically associated with **Windows Event Log** or **WMI** activity. This repetition may indicate **scripting** or **automated probing** for system vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **No Clear Legitimate Purpose**:\n   - The combination of **PowerShell**, **file checks**, and **registry modifications** without clear context (e.g., application installation, system updates) raises concerns. Legitimate scripts would typically have more structured logging or purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Deployment**: The `Test-Path` checks may be probing for the presence of files to determine if a system is \"ready\" for a payload or to confirm the success of prior stages of an attack.\n- **Persistence**: The registry modification could be part of an effort to **persist on the system** (e.g., adding a scheduled task or registry key).\n- **Command-and-Control (C2) Setup**: The repetitive checks might be part of **preparing for communication** with a C2 server, though no network activity is visible here.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Network Logs**:\n   - Check for **outbound connections** to suspicious IPs or domains that might be associated with the `Test-Path` file paths.\n   - Look for **data exfiltration** or **C2 traffic**.\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Investigate the files referenced in `Test-Path` (e.g., `unidade_principal.cs`, `componente_auxiliar.cs`) to determine if they are legitimate or malicious.\n\n3. **Check for Persistence**:\n   - Audit the registry for **unusual entries** related to the observed `cmd.exe` activity.\n\n4. **Monitor PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **SIEM** to detect further obfuscated scripts or lateral movement.\n\n5. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - If this is part of a larger attack, look for **similar patterns** on other systems or **credential theft** attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile no definitive proof of malicious intent is present, the combination of **obfuscated PowerShell scripts**, **unusual file paths**, and **registry modifications** strongly suggests **potential compromise** or **preparation for an attack**. Further investigation is **highly recommended**."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe, which is normal, but I should check for any unusual activities. The first event mentions the loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe there's something else. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... and then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of a script execution, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nLooking further, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The filenames like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 might be a red flag. Keystroke logging is often associated with keyloggers, which are malicious. Even though the scripts are checking for the existence of these files and exiting, the presence of such filenames in multiple paths could indicate an attempt to locate or execute malicious scripts. \n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger attack. The repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories might suggest that the attacker is trying to find where the script is located, possibly to execute it. \n\nHowever, none of the events directly show the execution of the script, just the checks.

That's normal, right? PowerShell often uses those DLLs. But then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it quickly might be a red flag. Maybe it's trying to execute something and then clean up.\n\nLooking further, there are some commands in the command_line fields. The first one checks if a certain Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script exists. If it doesn't, it exits with 1. The second one does something similar with another path. Wait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds suspicious. That name might indicate a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. But the command here is just checking if the file exists. However, the presence of such a script name in the paths could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThen there's a 'File created' event for a .yml.new file related to Winlogbeat. That might be a legitimate configuration file, but if it's being created in a Downloads directory, maybe that's part of an installation. However, the user is focusing on PowerShell events, so maybe that's not the main issue here.\n\nAnother point: multiple 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell. That's common, but combined with the other events, it might indicate something. Also, the 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which could be benign or malicious.\n\nLooking at the other processes: whoami.exe and calc.exe are normal, but the presence of notepad.exe and svchost.exe with registry changes might be normal too. However, the repeated 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell could be part of something trying to modify settings.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the creation and deletion of the .ps1 file in Temp, the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in the paths (even if just checked), and multiple image loads related to .NET which might be part of a malicious payload. However, some of these could be legitimate. For example, checking for the existence of a script might be part of a conditional execution. But the name of the script is a red flag. Also, the fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to hide the script's presence.\n\nI should also check if there are any other anomalies. The 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell might be modifying permissions or other settings. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of these events does seem suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, I think this batch is interesting and should be flagged for review.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious indicators that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activity**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in a temporary directory and later deleted. While temporary file creation is common, the **immediate deletion** may indicate an attempt to obscure malicious activity (e.g., executing a script and cleaning up traces).\n\n2. **Presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in Paths**:\n   - The command-line logs reference paths containing `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, a script name strongly associated with **keylogging** (a common malicious behavior). Even though the script is not explicitly executed here, its presence in the path raises concerns about potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Unusual Image Loads**:\n   - PowerShell loads multiple `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While normal for PowerShell, the **volume** of these events combined with the script creation\/deletion may suggest **payload execution** or **malware activity**.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for PowerShell and other processes (e.g., `notepad.exe`, `svchost.exe`) could indicate **configuration changes** or **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., altering startup scripts, registry keys for persistence).\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A `Pipe Created` event for PowerShell may indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)**, which could be used for **data exfiltration** or **covert communication** between processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Standard DLL Loads**: PowerShell and Windows processes (e.g., `calc.exe`, `svchost.exe`) loading system DLLs (e.g., `urlmon.dll`) is normal.\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: The `.yml.new` file creation for Winlogbeat may be part of a **configuration update** or **installation**.\n- **Whoami.exe**: A benign utility for checking user context.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events contains **multiple red flags** (e.g., suspicious script names, file creation\/deletion, registry changes) that **strongly suggest potential malicious activity**. While some events could be legitimate, the **combination of indicators** warrants further investigation, including:\n- Analyzing the contents of the deleted `.ps1` file (if available).\n- Correlating these events with network traffic or user behavior.\n- Checking for signs of **Persistence** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks).\n\n**Recommendation**: Flag the events for deeper analysis and consider isolating the affected system until the threat is confirmed or ruled out."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I should check if there's anything suspicious there.\n\nThen there's a bunch of powershell.exe processes. The first one is a ProcessAccess event, which is just accessing a process. Not sure yet. Then there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a common command to check user context. That's usually benign unless it's part of something else.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple NetworkConnect events from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome connecting to the internet is normal, but svchost.exe might be part of some background service. However, a lot of connections might be normal too, depending on the system's usage.\n\nThe interesting part might be the PowerShell activities. There's a ProcessCreate event for PowerShell with a command line that's using ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. That's just listing files recursively, which could be part of a script, but maybe not malicious. However, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework, which is normal. But the Windows Defender DLL (MpOAV.dll) being loaded might be relevant. Wait, Windows Defender is a legitimate process, so that's probably okay.\n\nWait, but the first event is about a new .yml file being created in the Downloads directory. If that's part of a configuration file for winlogbeat, that's normal. However, if there's any indication that this file was created by an unexpected process or if there's other suspicious activity around it, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell command line again: the user is running a script that recursively lists files. That could be part of a legitimate script, but combined with multiple ProcessAccess events and Registry changes, maybe there's something else going on. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like downloading files from suspicious domains, executing malicious code, or modifying critical system files.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. There's a mix of normal system activities and some PowerShell commands. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior—like unexpected network connections to known bad IPs, execution of unknown scripts, or modifications to system settings—it might not be interesting. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events and the creation of a new file might warrant further investigation. But without more context, it's hard to say.

So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the whole batch is interesting for investigation. The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through the events to see what's going on. The first few entries involve PowerShell creating and then deleting a script file in the Temp directory. That seems suspicious because creating a file and then deleting it quickly might be part of an attack, like dropping a malicious script and then cleaning up. But then there's a lot of other events with PowerShell executing commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse'. These are just regular PowerShell commands for listing files recursively, which might be part of normal user activity or maybe reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file is created in the Downloads folder called 'estrutura_secundario.txt'. That's a regular text file, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. Also, there are entries about the Windows Defender's MpClient.dll being loaded, which is normal. Then there are multiple entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory, which might be part of a legitimate installation or configuration process.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are entries where PowerShell and conhost.exe set registry values. Changing registry settings can be a sign of malware trying to persist or modify system behavior, but again, it could be a legitimate action.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events from PowerShell might indicate that the process is running scripts or modules that are part of normal operations, but if done in an unusual way, they could be suspicious. However, the commands here are basic file listing commands, which are common.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, I need to see if there's a pattern that suggests malicious activity. The initial file creation and deletion might be a red flag, but followed by a lot of normal PowerShell operations and file creations. The presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could be part of a larger attack, but without more context or other indicators like network activity, unusual process behavior, or known malicious files, it's hard to be certain.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple events involving PowerShell creating files in temporary and download directories, along with registry changes, might be enough to consider this interesting. Attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement and data exfiltration, and creating files in temporary directories is a common tactic. The deletion of the script file could be an attempt to hide evidence.\n\nBut on the other hand, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, the user might be running scripts to manage files, and the registry changes could be part of a configuration tool. The winlogbeat entries are related to log shipping, which is a legitimate activity.\n\nSo, I'm a bit torn. The presence of multiple PowerShell activities and file operations could be benign or malicious. However, the combination of file creation, deletion, and registry changes might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation. The confidence isn't extremely high because there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent, but the suspicious patterns are present.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities involving file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior or reconnaissance. The temporary file creation\/deletion pattern is commonly associated with attack chains.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
