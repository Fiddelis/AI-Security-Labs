{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a command-line tool that displays user information. That's usually benign, but maybe in context it's part of something else.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. One of the entries has a command line that includes \"ls -recurse\", \"get-childitem -recurse\", and \"gci -recurse\". These are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. That could be part of a script that's exploring the file system, which might be normal, but if done excessively or in a suspicious context, it could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple image load events for PowerShell, including some .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1. The creation and deletion might be part of a script execution that's trying to clean up after itself, which is sometimes seen in malicious activities to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events, which might relate to PowerShell's internal operations. However, the repetition of these events could indicate a script that's running multiple times or being triggered repeatedly.\n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events are normal, like browser activity and standard PowerShell operations. However, the combination of creating and deleting a temporary script file, along with multiple PowerShell commands that recursively list files, might indicate an attempt to explore the system or execute a script that's not fully visible. While not conclusive, these patterns are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. The presence of these events together could be indicative of a malicious actor trying to gather information or execute a script without leaving persistent files. Therefore, the batch is interesting but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show recursive file listing commands, temporary script creation\/deletion, and potential script execution attempts. While not definitively malicious, these patterns suggest possible system exploration or obfuscation techniques warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe loaded an image from a Defender DLL. Wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\... That's a legitimate path for Windows Defender. So maybe that's just a normal process. But I should note that.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But there are multiple entries of winlogbeat creating the same .yml.new file. Maybe that's just part of its setup, but maybe it's being tampered with? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a powershell command that's doing recursive ls and get-childitem. That's just listing files, which isn't necessarily malicious, but could be part of reconnaissance. But alone, it's not a red flag.\n\nAnother powershell.exe created a file called objeto_principal.txt in the user's Downloads. That's a normal file name, but without knowing the content, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's benign, but maybe not.\n\nThere are several registry value set events from powershell.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, etc. Registry changes can be suspicious if they're modifying key settings, but without knowing the specific keys or values, it's hard to say. However, svchost.exe and conhost.exe are system processes, so their registry changes might be part of normal operations, but could also be part of a compromise.\n\nThe logon events and user account management tasks are probably normal system activities, especially if they're related to user logins or account management. But there are a lot of them, which might indicate something, but maybe not.\n\nLooking at the confidence: the presence of multiple registry changes, file creations, and the use of PowerShell could be indicative of something. However, many of the events are from legitimate processes like winlogbeat and Defender. The repetition of the same file creation by winlogbeat might be normal during setup. The PowerShell activities don't seem overly suspicious on their own. However, the combination of multiple file creations, registry changes, and the use of PowerShell might suggest some level of activity that's worth investigating. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like downloading executables, connecting to suspicious IPs, etc.), it's not a clear-cut case. So, I'd say it's interesting but not highly confident. Maybe around 0.6 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and svchost.exe activities involving file creation, registry modifications, and process access could indicate potential reconnaissance or configuration changes. While some events (e.g., Windows Defender DLL load, winlogbeat file creation) appear legitimate, the frequency of registry events and PowerShell usage warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: calc.exe (which is a legitimate Windows calculator) loaded urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of the Windows system, so that's normal. But wait, the process name is 'calc.exe' but the next event has 'Calculator.exe'â€”they might be different, but maybe a typo or case sensitivity? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are two events with svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and setting registry values isn't unusual, but if it's done multiple times, maybe something's going on. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys or unusual parameters, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe third event is another svchost.exe registry change. Since there are two identical events here, maybe it's a repetition or a log error. But the user said to consider the entire batch. \n\nThe fourth event again has Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Now, Calculator.exe isn't a standard name; usually, it's calc.exe. That might be a red flag. Also, if urlmon.dll is being loaded by different processes, but it's a system file, so that's normal. But if there's a mismatch in process names, maybe that's suspicious.\n\nWait, the first event's process is 'calc.exe' (lowercase 'c'), while the fourth is 'Calculator.exe' (capitalized). That might be a case sensitivity issue, but in Windows, process names are case-insensitive. However, the presence of both could indicate different processes or maybe a typo. But if both are legitimate, then it's not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: The events involve normal system processes and standard system files. The registry changes by svchost.exe are common. The process names vary slightly but are likely legitimate. There's no indication of malicious activity like unexpected file paths, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation. So, the batch doesn't seem to have anything suspicious. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with medium confidence, since there's no clear evidence of an attack, but the slight variations in process names could be a minor red flag.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve standard system processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe) and legitimate system files (urlmon.dll). Registry modifications by svchost.exe are common for Windows services. No signs of suspicious activity, unauthorized access, or malicious payloads detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
