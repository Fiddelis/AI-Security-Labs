{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is being accessed, creating processes, and loading images. Some of the image loads are standard system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so maybe that's normal. But then there's one entry where it's loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Wait, Windows Defender's DLLs might be part of legitimate operations, but maybe in this context, it's being used in a way that's not typical.\n\nThen there are several events where PowerShell is creating files in the temporary directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1, and then immediately deleting them. That's suspicious. Creating and deleting files quickly could be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The file names have \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" in them, which might be a red herring, but the fact that they're created and then deleted is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, looking at the command lines, there are multiple instances of Compress-Archive being used with paths that have a lot of obfuscation. The paths are like \"C:\\\\modulo_temporario\\\\objeto_principal\\\\unidade_secundario\\\\bin\\\\entrada_logico\" and so on. These paths seem to be using non-English terms, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual location or purpose. The use of Compress-Archive could be part of a larger operation, maybe to package files for exfiltration or to execute code in a compressed format, which is sometimes seen in malicious scripts.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of events. There are multiple ProcessCreate events for PowerShell, and several ImageLoad events. While PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, the sheer number of events might indicate something is wrong. Also, the presence of the Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which could be legitimate but in this context, combined with other suspicious activities, it's worth looking into.\n\nThe Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks might be related to the PowerShell provider or engine, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of these events with the file creation and deletion, and the obfuscated paths, makes me think this could be part of a malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the creation and deletion of temporary files, the use of Compress-Archive with obfuscated paths, and the loading of a Windows Defender DLL (though that might be a false positive) all point towards potential malicious behavior. Even though some of the events could be normal, the combination and the patterns here are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity**  \n   - **Multiple `ProcessCreate` and `PipeCreated` events** for `powershell.exe` suggest extensive use of PowerShell, which is often exploited by attackers for command execution, data exfiltration, or lateral movement.\n\n2. **Obfuscated File Paths and Compression**  \n   - **`Compress-Archive` commands** with highly obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_temporario\\objeto_principal\\...`) are repeated across multiple events. This could indicate **data packaging** for exfiltration or execution of obfuscated payloads, a common tactic in malware.\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**  \n   - Files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1` are **created and immediately deleted** in the `%TEMP%` directory. This behavior is often used to **hide malicious scripts** or avoid detection by loggers.\n\n4. **Unusual DLL Loading**  \n   - **`MpOAV.dll`** (from Windows Defender) is loaded via `ImageLoad`. While this DLL is legitimate, its presence in this context may be **exploited for malicious purposes** (e.g., hooking into Defender's processes).\n\n5. **Repetition and Automation**  \n   - The repetitive use of `Compress-Archive` with similar structures suggests **automation or scripting**, possibly for **data exfiltration, persistence, or evasion**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Execution via PowerShell**: The use of `Compress-Archive` and temporary files could be part of a **payload delivery mechanism** (e.g., compressing and executing malicious code).\n- **Data Exfiltration**: The repeated compression of files in obfuscated paths may indicate **sensitive data being packaged for exfiltration**.\n- **Evasion Techniques**: File creation\/deletion and obfuscation are classic evasion tactics to avoid detection by antivirus or logging systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for network traffic (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs) or registry changes that may indicate persistence.\n- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: Extract and analyze the contents of deleted temporary files (if possible) for malicious code.\n- **Check Windows Defender Logs**: Investigate the `MpOAV.dll` load for signs of tampering or unexpected behavior.\n- **Monitor User Activity**: Determine if the user account executing these commands has **unusual privileges** or access to sensitive systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **highly suspicious** and likely part of **malicious activity** (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement, or persistence). Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm the threat and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender is a trusted component. The file path is in the ProgramData directory, which is common for system files. But maybe the version number is odd? 4.18.25030.2-0. Not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, there are several entries where powershell.exe is used with Compress-Archive. The command lines look like they're compressing directories into temporary files. The paths being compressed have names like \"componente_auxiliar\" and \"modulo_temporario,\" which are in Portuguese. That might be a red flag if they're part of obfuscation or if the actual content is malicious. However, just compressing files isn't inherently bad. But the fact that multiple compressions are happening could indicate something, like preparing to move files or maybe packing payloads.\n\nLooking at the file paths for the Compress-Archive commands, they all reference the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module. That's a standard module, so using it is normal. But the repetition of similar commands might be noteworthy. Are these all part of the same process or different ones? The logs don't specify, but multiple instances could be part of a larger operation.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal. But the same entry appears twice, which might be a duplication error or just a log repetition. Not sure yet.\n\nSeveral registry events are logged, with processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, etc., setting registry values. Registry changes can be benign, but if done by unexpected processes, they might be a concern. However, many of these processes are common system utilities, so it's hard to say without more context.\n\nThere's also an image loaded event for calc.exe (Calculator) loading urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL, so probably not malicious. The same for Calculator.exe in another entry. These seem normal.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell compressions, some registry changes, and standard system processes. The key point here is whether the PowerShell activities are part of normal operations or something more sinister. Compressing files into temporary directories could be part of legitimate tasks, but if done in a way that's evading detection or part of a larger attack chain, it's suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file. If this is part of a log collection setup, that's fine. But if the file is being modified or created in an unusual way, it could be a sign of tampering. However, the logs don't show any anomalies in that specific entry beyond the file creation.\n\nI should also check for any unusual combinations. For example, the first entry with Windows Defender's DLL being loaded by PowerShell. That might be a sign of something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe a false positive.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious parts are the repeated Compress-Archive commands using PowerShell, possibly moving or hiding files, and the registry changes by various processes. However, without additional indicators like network activity, unexpected processes, or known malicious hashes, it's hard to confirm. The logs don't show clear signs of malware or attacks, but the repetitive PowerShell actions could warrant further investigation to ensure they're not part of a larger scheme.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of legitimate system activity and potential indicators of interest that may warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Compression Activities:**\n   - **Multiple instances** of `powershell.exe` executing `Compress-Archive` commands to compress directories (e.g., `componente_auxiliar`, `modulo_temporario`) into temporary files. \n   - **Context:** While compressing files is normal, the **repetition** of such commands and the use of **non-English directory names** (e.g., Portuguese terms) could indicate obfuscation or preparation for lateral movement\/data exfiltration. \n   - **Risk:** Requires correlation with other logs (e.g., network traffic, file destinations) to determine if this is part of a benign task or a malicious payload.\n\n2. **Legitimate System Activity:**\n   - **Windows Defender (`urlmon.dll`)**: Loading `urlmon.dll` by `calc.exe` or `Calculator.exe` is standard for Internet Explorer\/Windows components and not inherently suspicious.\n   - **Winlogbeat**: Creating a `.yml` configuration file in the `Downloads` directory is typical for log shippers and not malicious unless anomalous context (e.g., unexpected file modifications) is present.\n\n3. **Registry Activity:**\n   - **Multiple processes** (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `notepad.exe`) modifying registry values. \n   - **Context:** Registry changes are common for system utilities, but **unusual changes** by non-system processes (e.g., `powershell.exe` modifying registry keys unrelated to its function) could indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering.\n\n4. **No Clear Malware Indicators:**\n   - No entries show **malicious file hashes**, **unexpected network connections**, or **unusual process behavior** (e.g., `calc.exe` or `svchost.exe` executing non-standard tasks).\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- The **repeated use of PowerShell for compression** could be a red flag if these operations are part of a larger attack chain (e.g., packing malicious payloads, evading detection).\n- **Lack of context** (e.g., network activity, user behavior) makes it difficult to confirm if these actions are benign or part of a threat.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with network logs** to check if compressed files are being exfiltrated or used in lateral movement.\n- **Investigate PowerShell scripts** (if available) to determine the purpose of the compression commands.\n- **Monitor registry changes** by non-system processes for anomalies (e.g., unauthorized modifications to critical keys).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **do not clearly indicate a security incident**, but the **repeated PowerShell compression activities** and **registry modifications** warrant further investigation. This could be a false positive, but without additional context, these patterns merit closer scrutiny. \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Low to Medium Risk** – Further analysis is recommended to rule out potential malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are about chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of them. But chrome.exe is a common browser, and it's possible that it interacts with the registry normally. However, if there's a sudden increase in such events, that might be suspicious. But I need to check if there's anything else.\n\nLooking further down, there's an entry where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll from the System32 directory. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Normally, this file is signed and comes from Microsoft. But if it's being loaded by chrome.exe, that might not be normal. However, maybe it's part of some legitimate process. But then there's another entry where chrome.exe loads MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender Platform. That's also a legitimate file. Hmm, maybe those are just normal operations?\n\nWait, but then there's another event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new. Maybe that's just a temporary file during setup. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are two events with powershell.exe accessing processes. Process access can be normal, but if it's done multiple times or in a way that's unusual, it could be a red flag. But in this case, there are only two entries, and no specific details about what's being accessed.\n\nAnother entry is whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get the current user, so that's probably benign unless done in a suspicious context. But there's no other info here.\n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events are chrome.exe doing registry modifications. While that's not inherently malicious, if it's happening a lot, it might indicate something. However, the other events involve legitimate system files and processes. The presence of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll being loaded by chrome.exe might be normal if, for example, the browser is interacting with Windows Defender. But I should check if that's typical. Also, the winlogbeat file creation seems like a normal setup activity. The powershell events are minimal and not detailed enough to be suspicious.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format, and I need to consider the entire batch. The repetition of chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times might be more concerning. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple registry events from chrome.exe could be part of a legitimate process, like updating settings, but could also be part of a malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nBut the other events don't seem to indicate any obvious malicious activity. The files loaded are legitimate, and the processes are standard. The winlogbeat event is probably just installing or configuring the tool. The whoami.exe is a simple command. The powershell events are not detailed enough to be alarming.\n\nSo, considering all that, the batch might not be highly suspicious. The majority of events are from chrome.exe, which is common, and the other events are normal. However, the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe could be worth investigating further. But without more context, it's not a strong indicator of a security incident. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe \"INTERESTING\" because of the multiple registry changes, but I need to weigh the evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe) performing normal operations like registry modifications, file creation, and process access. No clear indicators of malicious activity (e.g., unexpected binaries, suspicious paths, or anomalous behavior) are present across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
