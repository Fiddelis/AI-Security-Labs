So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a powershell.exe process that's downloading files from GitHub. The command line shows DownloadFile being used with URLs from raw.githubusercontent.com. That's a common technique for downloading files, but sometimes it's used in malicious scripts to fetch payloads.\n\nLooking further, there's a lot of Image Load events for PowerShell, which includes some .NET DLLs and even the Windows Defender MpOAV.dll. Loading legitimate system files might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger process. Also, there are File Create and Delete events for temporary files. The pattern of creating and then deleting a file might be an attempt to hide activity, which is suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes using WebClient to download LICENSE.txt files from various GitHub repositories. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the fact that so many downloads are happening, especially with different repositories, might indicate that someone is trying to execute scripts or download malicious content under the guise of fetching license files. The use of $env:TEMP to store the downloaded files is also a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these activities are benign. For example, some GitHub repositories might legitimately have LICENSE.txt files. But the repetition and the combination with other events like registry changes and image loads might indicate something more. Also, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes with different command lines could be part of a script that's performing multiple actions.\n\nThe classification here would depend on whether the activities are typical or if they indicate a potential security threat. Since PowerShell is often used in attacks, and the events include downloading files and modifying the registry, this seems suspicious. However, without more context, like the presence of known malicious hashes or unexpected network destinations, it's a bit tricky. But the fact that there are multiple downloads from different repositories, along with the file creation and deletion, makes me lean towards \"INTERESTING\" as the classification.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a favorite tool for attackers. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a PowerShell command that downloads a file from a GitHub URL using WebClient's DownloadFile method. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is normal for hosting text files like LICENSE.txt. However, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from different repositories might be a red flag. \n\nWait, the first few entries show PowerShell downloading LICENSE.txt from various GitHub repos. But why so many? Typically, a legitimate user might download a file once, but multiple downloads from different locations could indicate something automated or malicious. Also, the filenames are things like \"estrutura_temporario.txt\" and \"tarefa_ativo.txt\" which are in the TEMP directory. That's a common tactic for malware to store temporary files.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for \"elemento_padrao.txt\" in the Downloads folder. Not sure if that's suspicious yet. But the repeated Registry value set events for chrome.exe might be normal if Chrome is being configured, but there are eight of them in a row. That's a lot. Maybe Chrome is being manipulated, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating configuration files, that's normal. But the same file is created multiple times, which might be redundant or part of a setup process.\n\nThe Network connection detected event for MpDefenderCoreService.exe (Microsoft Defender) might be normal, but if there's a lot of network activity from Defender, that could indicate something's trying to bypass it. However, there's only one such event here.\n\nThe Dns query event is from a process that's None, which might be a placeholder or an error in the log. Not sure, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nLooking back at the PowerShell commands, they're all using the same method to download files. The URLs are from GitHub, which is a legitimate source, but the fact that they're downloading LICENSE.txt files might be a way to execute code. Wait, LICENSE.txt is usually a plain text file, but if the attacker is using a different file type or executing a script, that's bad. However, in the logs provided, the command_line shows DownloadFile with a .txt file, which is less likely to be malicious. But maybe the attacker is using a different method to inject code.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple File created events for PowerShell, which might be normal, but combined with the registry changes and the downloads, it could be part of a larger attack. However, without seeing the content of the downloaded files or more network activity, it's hard to confirm.\n\nSo, the main red flags here are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, the numerous Registry changes for Chrome, and the repeated file creation by winlogbeat. However, some of these could be legitimate. The key is that the PowerShell downloads are using a method that's commonly abused in attacks. Even though the files are from GitHub, the pattern might still be suspicious. \n\nI think the answer here is that while some activities are normal, the combination of multiple PowerShell downloads and registry changes could indicate a potential security incident worth investigating further. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several activities that warrant further investigation, though not all are definitively malicious. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **PowerShell Download Activity**:\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands to download files from **GitHub raw URLs** (e.g., `https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...\/LICENSE.txt`) using `WebClient.DownloadFile`. \n   - **Why this matters**: While GitHub is a legitimate source, using PowerShell to download files from external repositories is a common tactic in **malware delivery** or **script-based attacks**. The repeated use of this method (across different URLs) raises concerns about **automated execution** or **payload delivery**.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation**:\n   - Files like `estrutura_temporario.txt` and `tarefa_ativo.txt` are created in the **TEMP directory** (common for malware to store transient data). This aligns with patterns seen in **exploits** or **payload staging**.\n\n3. **Excessive Registry Modifications**:\n   - **8+ instances** of `chrome.exe` triggering `Registry value set` events. While Chrome configuration changes are possible, this volume of activity could indicate **tampering** (e.g., injecting malicious code or altering behavior).\n\n4. **Repeated File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`**:\n   - The same file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is created **multiple times**. This might suggest **configuration errors**, **redundant operations**, or **unauthorized modifications** to a log-shipper tool, which could be exploited.\n\n5. **Network Activity from `MpDefenderCoreService.exe`**:\n   - A single event logs a **network connection** from Microsoft Defender. While normal, it could indicate **Defender bypass attempts** if correlated with other suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activities**\n- **Winlogbeat file creation**: Normal during configuration or setup.\n- **Chrome registry changes**: Could reflect legitimate user or application behavior (e.g., extension updates).\n- **Notepad\/Other processes**: Common system tools; no immediate red flags.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**This batch is interesting for investigation** due to:\n- **PowerShell-based downloads** from external repositories (a common attack vector).\n- **Unusual volume of registry changes** and **repeated file creation**.\n- **Potential misuse of log-shippers** (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`).\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Correlate the downloaded files with known malicious hashes or content analysis.\n- Investigate the `chrome.exe` registry modifications for unauthorized changes.\n- Monitor `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` for unusual network behavior.\n- Check for **unauthorized PowerShell scripts** or **exploits** leveraging GitHub URLs.\n\nWhile not conclusive proof of compromise, the combination of these indicators suggests a **low-to-moderate risk** incident requiring deeper analysis."}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe the fact that it's loading a system DLL isn't suspicious on its own. Then there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a normal host process, but frequent registry changes could be a red flag, especially if they're modifying key areas.\n\nNext, there's a Calculator.exe (which is just another name for calc.exe) loading the same urlmon.dll. That might be redundant, but maybe it's just a normal process. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, so that's something to note. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\" with the \/F flag, which forces deletion without confirmation. That could be part of removing a malicious task. Then, another cmd.exe command uses REG DELETE to remove entries from the Run key in the registry. Deleting registry entries might be an attempt to clean up after installing a backdoor or malware.\n\nThere's also a schtasks.exe process that deletes the same \"spawn\" task. Scheduled tasks can be used by attackers to persist, so deleting them might be an evasion technique. The use of reg.exe to delete registry values is another point. \n\nMultiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events could indicate someone is trying to manipulate the system. The repetition of certain commands, like deleting registry entries and scheduled tasks, suggests a pattern that might be part of a larger attack. \n\nHowever, I should check if these are all legitimate. For example, svchost.exe and cmd.exe are normal processes, but their actions here are more frequent than usual. The presence of multiple registry modifications and the use of PowerShell and CMD to delete tasks and registry entries could be signs of an attacker trying to remove traces. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of registry deletions, scheduled task removals, and multiple PowerShell\/cmd.exe activities seems suspicious.

There are several entries with \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" tasks. But what stands out are the \"Image loaded\" events. Let me check those. The files loaded here include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to the .NET Framework. That's normal for PowerShell, as it uses .NET, so maybe not suspicious. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so loading that might be normal too. \n\nWait, but there's a file created and then immediately deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1.

For example, PowerShell using .NET assemblies is common. The file creation and deletion might be part of a legitimate process, like a script that's testing permissions or cleaning up.

That might be part of a normal process, but sometimes attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of Remove-Item commands in the Temp directory. The user is deleting various .zip and .txt files. This could be part of cleaning up after some activity, but if those files were malicious, that's a concern. However, the commands are using -ErrorAction Ignore, which might be to prevent errors if the files don't exist. That's a common tactic in scripts to avoid logging.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but sometimes pipes are used in malicious scripts.

That's a bit suspicious because usually, deleting files in TEMP might be part of normal operations, but combined with other actions, it could be something else.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and then deleting files in the TEMP directory.

It could be part of a script that's trying to clean up after itself or avoid detection. The presence of multiple similar events makes me think this is worth investigating further. So, I'd say this batch is interesting and should be looked into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n### **1. Repeated File Manipulation in Temporary Directories**\n- **Multiple `Remove-Item` Commands**: PowerShell processes repeatedly attempt to delete files (e.g., `unidade_base.txt`, `registro_auxiliar.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`) in the `%TEMP%` directory using `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore`. This behavior is often seen in malware to evade detection by removing evidence of temporary files or scripts.\n- **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**: A PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in the `AppData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell` directory and later deleted. This suggests an attempt to execute a script or configuration file without leaving persistent traces.\n\n### **2. PowerShell as a Vector for Suspicious Activity**\n- **High Frequency of PowerShell Events**: Over 20 PowerShell-related events are logged, including file operations, registry modifications, and process access. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its frequent use in this context—particularly with file deletion and registry changes—raises concerns about potential misuse (e.g., executing malicious scripts or bypassing security controls).\n- **Windows Defender DLLs Loaded**: PowerShell loads `MpClient.dll` and `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender. This could indicate an attempt to interact with or bypass antivirus components, though further analysis is needed to confirm malicious intent.\n\n### **3. Potential for Evasion or Data Exfiltration**\n- **Use of `-ErrorAction Ignore`**: This parameter suppresses error messages, which is commonly used in malicious scripts to avoid alerting users or systems to failed operations.\n- **File Naming Patterns**: Files like `pacote_ativo.txt` and `objeto_padrao.txt` (translated from Portuguese as \"active package\" and \"default object\") may hint at attempts to manipulate system configurations or exfiltrate data under the guise of legitimate operations.\n\n### **4. Contextual Red Flags**\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose**: The repeated deletion of files in `%TEMP%` and the creation of transient scripts lack a clear, legitimate justification. Such behavior is often associated with malware or post-exploitation activities.\n- **Unusual Registry Modifications**: The `Registry value set` events (multiple instances) could indicate attempts to alter system settings or inject malicious configurations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries **strongly suggest a potential security incident**. The combination of repeated file manipulation in temporary directories, PowerShell misuse, and evasion techniques (e.g., suppressing errors) aligns with tactics used by malware or attackers to operate covertly. Further investigation is warranted, including:\n- **Analyzing the deleted files** (if possible via forensic tools) for remnants of malicious content.\n- **Correlating with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine if data exfiltration or lateral movement occurred.\n- **Checking for unauthorized registry changes** or persistence mechanisms.\n\n**Recommendation**: Treat this as a high-priority alert for incident response and security team review."}
