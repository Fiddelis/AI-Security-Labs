{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not suspicious. But then I see entries about powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used for scripting, which can be legitimate, but combined with other actions, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line for cmd.exe that uses sc.exe to create a service with a path that looks like it's pointing to some executable files. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe\", seem a bit generic and possibly not standard Windows paths. Creating services with custom executables can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if those executables are not known or trusted.\n\nThen there are entries about registry value sets by services.exe and sc.exe. Modifying the registry is a common technique for persistence, which is a red flag. Also, the use of sc.exe to start services might be part of installing a backdoor or a persistent mechanism.\n\nThe image load events mention loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate .NET components, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context or from unexpected locations, that could be suspicious. However, the paths here are standard Windows directories, so maybe that's okay. But combined with the service creation and registry changes, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. This could indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which might be part of an attack or just normal system monitoring. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of service creation with custom executables, registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe with non-standard commands could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code. The fact that these events are not all from the same process and involve multiple system components might suggest a coordinated attack. However, some of these activities (like normal DNS queries and network connections by Chrome) are benign. The key is whether the suspicious activities are part of a larger pattern.\n\nI need to weigh the benign activities against the potentially malicious ones. The service creation and registry changes are more concerning. Even though some of the DLLs are legitimate, the combination of events could be indicative of a security incident. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, with several indicators that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlights**\n1. **Unusual Service Creation**:\n   - **`cmd.exe`** and **`sc.exe`** are used to create services with custom executables (e.g., `unidade_base.exe`, `modulo_secundario.exe`). These paths (`C:\\elemento_geral\\...`) are non-standard and not typical of legitimate Windows services. This could indicate **malware persistence** or **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events by **`services.exe`**, **`cmd.exe`**, and **`conhost.exe`** suggest attempts to modify system settings. This is a common technique for **persistence** or **disabling security controls**.\n\n3. **Unusual Image Loads**:\n   - **`.NET DLLs`** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded by processes like **`estrutura_principal.exe`**. While these are legitimate components, their association with non-standard executables (e.g., `modulo_secundario.exe`) raises concerns about **unauthorized code execution** or **malware masquerading as .NET components**.\n\n4. **PowerShell and Command-Line Activity**:\n   - **`powershell.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** are involved in **`ProcessAccess`** events, which could indicate **scripting for lateral movement**, **data exfiltration**, or **payload execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Benign Activity**\n- **Chrome.exe** performing **DNS queries** and **network connections** is normal for a browser.\n- **Legitimate .NET DLLs** (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are loaded in standard paths, which is typical for .NET applications.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Indicator of Compromise (IoC)**: The combination of **non-standard service creation**, **registry modifications**, and **unusual image loads** suggests **potential malware activity** or **post-compromise behavior**.\n- **Context Needed**: Further analysis (e.g., process tree, network traffic, file hashes) is required to confirm if these activities are malicious or part of a legitimate application.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the presence of **suspicious service creation, registry changes, and unusual process behavior**. While some activities are benign, the overall pattern raises **red flags** that could indicate **malware persistence**, **exploitation**, or **post-compromise activity**. A deeper dive into the context (e.g., file integrity, network behavior, user context) is recommended. \n\n**Recommendation**: Prioritize this batch for further analysis using threat intelligence, file reputation checks, and behavioral analysis tools."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze the batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key is to look at all events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each entry. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of Elastic's Winlogbeat, which is used for log collection. But then there's a powershell.exe process with Registry value set events. PowerShell is common, but when combined with registry changes, that could be suspicious. \n\nWait, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe accessing the registry. However, some of these might be normal. For example, svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, and RuntimeBroker.exe is related to UAC. But the repetition of registry events might indicate something. \n\nThen there are ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL part of Windows. But why are they being loaded? The process names here are Calculator.exe and calc.exe. Wait, Calculator.exe is a normal app, but calc.exe is the actual process. However, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is correct. So those might be normal.\n\nBut looking back, the main thing is the creation of the .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That's a configuration file for Winlogbeat. If that's being created, maybe it's part of a setup. However, if there are other events like registry changes from PowerShell, maybe someone is trying to modify settings. \n\nBut are there any signs of malicious activity? The events don't show any obvious malicious actions like downloading files from suspicious sources, unexpected network connections, or process injections. The processes involved are mostly legitimate, though PowerShell is often used in attacks. However, without more context, like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected file modifications, it's hard to say.\n\nSo, the justification would be that while there are some events that could be benign (like Winlogbeat creating a config file and PowerShell modifying the registry), there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. However, the repetition of registry access by PowerShell might warrant further investigation. But since the confidence is a bit low, maybe it's not interesting. Alternatively, if the registry changes are part of a known good process, then it's not interesting. But without more info, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate processes (winlogbeat, svchost, powershell) performing standard operations (file creation, registry access, image loading). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
