{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the processes and their associated tasks. There are several instances of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' being used. The command lines in some of the 'cmd.exe' entries stand out. For example, there's a command that adds a user with 'net user \/add' and adds them to the administrators group. That's a red flag because creating new user accounts and adding them to admin groups can be part of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\nThen there are multiple 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' processes. The 'net1.exe' might be a typo or a malicious version of 'net.exe', especially since it's using a path like 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1'. The fact that both 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' are being used to add users and modify groups suggests potential tampering with system tools.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' tasks, there are several 'User Account Management' and 'Security Group Management' events. This could indicate changes to user permissions, which is suspicious if done without authorization. Also, the 'Registry value set' events might be part of configuring the system for persistence or altering security settings.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File created' event for '.winlogbeat.yml.new'. While this might be part of a legitimate configuration, it's worth checking if this file is part of a known tool or if it's unusual. However, the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' is a log shipper, so maybe it's part of monitoring, but combined with other events, it might be a false positive or part of a larger attack.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for 'BitsProxy.dll' by 'svchost.exe' and 'OneDrive.exe' could be benign, but sometimes malicious software uses legitimate DLLs. However, without more context, it's hard to tell, but combined with other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe repetition of 'Registry value set' by various processes like 'chrome.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' might be normal, but if these processes are doing unexpected registry changes, that's a problem. However, the justification here is more about the user account and group management changes, which are high-risk actions.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple attempts to create user accounts, modify security groups, and use potentially malicious processes. These activities are typically associated with attackers trying to gain persistent access or escalate privileges. Therefore, the batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of new user accounts (e.g., 'modulo_geral_Admin', 'modulo_principal_Admin') with potential weak passwords, addition of users to administrator groups, use of 'net1.exe' (likely a malicious variant of 'net.exe'), and repeated registry modifications by non-system processes. These patterns are indicative of privilege escalation or unauthorized system access attempts.\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION DETAILS\": \"Key indicators include: 1) 'cmd.exe' executing 'net user \/add' commands with potential admin group memberships, 2) 'net1.exe' (malicious tool) used for network configuration, 3) excessive registry writes by 'chrome.exe', 'Calculator.exe', and 'powershell.exe' (unusual for these applications), 4) creation of a potential configuration file (.winlogbeat.yml.new) which may be part of a larger attack chain.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but when it happens multiple times, it could be a sign of something. However, just repeated registry changes might not be enough on their own. I need to check if there's anything else going on.\n\nLooking further, there are a couple of image loaded events. One is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading this DLL from the System32 directory seems normal. But then there's another image loaded from a path under Windows Defender's Platform, specifically MpOAV.dll. That's part of Microsoft Defender's real-time protection. Loading these DLLs might be normal if they're part of legitimate processes, but I should check if they're being loaded in an unusual context.\n\nWait, the process here is chrome.exe. Chrome typically doesn't need to load amsi.dll or MpOAV.dll directly. Those are usually loaded by security software or the operating system itself. If chrome.exe is loading these DLLs, it could be a sign of something malicious trying to hook into the security features or bypass them. That's a red flag.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of its setup. However, the filename has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file that's being written to. Not sure if that's suspicious yet, but not the most concerning.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating a text file named \"componente_secundario.txt\". The name is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring, but creating a file via PowerShell isn't inherently bad. However, if there's no clear reason for this file, it could be part of data exfiltration or something else. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering all the events together. The majority are chrome.exe modifying the registry. If that's part of normal operation, like updating settings, it's fine. But if it's modifying security-related registry keys, that's a problem. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed. The task is just \"Registry value set\", so we don't know the exact key or value. That's a bit of a gap in the data.\n\nThe image loaded events from chrome.exe for security-related DLLs are more concerning. If an attacker is trying to inject code or bypass security measures, they might load these DLLs in an unexpected way. However, without more details on the context, like the parent process or the nature of the load, it's hard to be certain. But the fact that chrome.exe is loading these DLLs is unusual and could be a sign of compromise.\n\nThe other events, like the file creations, might be benign. The winlogbeat file is part of a log shipper, and the PowerShell-created file could be part of a user's activities. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are security-related components, and having them loaded by a browser process is not typical. This could indicate that someone is trying to manipulate or bypass security features. The repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe could be part of that effort, such as changing settings to disable security features.\n\nHowever, since the logs don't provide the exact registry keys or more context on the image load events, the confidence isn't 100%. But there's enough here to warrant further investigation. The combination of unusual process behavior (chrome.exe loading security DLLs) and multiple registry changes could be indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing registry modifications combined with loading security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) raises suspicion. Chrome typically doesn't interact with these security components directly, which could indicate process injection or evasion techniques. The volume of registry events also suggests potential configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
