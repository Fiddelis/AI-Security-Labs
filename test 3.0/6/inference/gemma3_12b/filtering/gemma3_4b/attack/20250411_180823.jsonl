These tasks use suspicious naming conventions (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon', 'unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup'). The frequent network connections from 'chrome.exe' and the process access events for 'powershell.exe' further contribute to the suspicion. While `calc.exe` itself isn't malicious, the repeated scheduling and use of it within scheduled tasks could be a diversion tactic to conceal malicious activity, or indicate a persistent threat.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
