These commands use hardcoded file paths with suggestive names like 'objeto_secundario', 'pacote_base', 'registro_principal', indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious activity. The use of `Compress-Archive` combined with the frequency of PowerShell executions raises suspicion. There's also activity related to DLLs (clr.dll, clrjit.dll, MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll), WindowsPowerShell modules, and other processes, suggesting a complex operational sequence. Finally, the presence of `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` is an unusual and potentially suspicious event.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
