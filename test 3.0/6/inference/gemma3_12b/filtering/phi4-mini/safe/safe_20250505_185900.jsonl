The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script ('__PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1') strongly suggests a script policy bypass attempt, which warrants investigation. Additionally, the frequent PowerShell executions with lifecycle events and image loads raise suspicion, particularly in conjunction with the winlogbeat.exe activity. While winlogbeat is expected, its file creation activities and correlation with PowerShell events is noteworthy.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
