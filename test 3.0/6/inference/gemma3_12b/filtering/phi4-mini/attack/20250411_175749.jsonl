Repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks are concerning. The presence of 'powershell.exe' process creation, access, and a file created by it ('modulo_temporario.txt') are strong indicators of potential malicious scripts being executed. Image loads of amsi.dll and MPOAV.dll within Chrome could suggest attempts to evade detection.
