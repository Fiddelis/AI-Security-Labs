This pattern is strongly indicative of potential malicious activity, specifically persistence mechanisms.  Multiple tasks are created with different names ('unidade_ativo', 'registro_geral', etc.), suggesting an attempt to evade detection through task diversification. The subsequent loading of .NET framework components by PowerShell further reinforces concerns about potentially complex malicious payloads.
