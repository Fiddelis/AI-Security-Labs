The usage of 'cmd.exe' to invoke PowerShell with bypass execution policy is a common technique for evading detection. Additionally, other PowerShell instances are accessing files. The presence of suspicious scheduled tasks with non-existent script paths and the techniques used to execute them are indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
