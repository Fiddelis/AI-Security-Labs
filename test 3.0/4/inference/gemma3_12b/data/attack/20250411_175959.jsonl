It includes registry modifications, numerous .NET framework DLL loads (often a sign of malware), file creation\/deletion in a temporary directory, and repeated execution of a command line including user and group enumeration commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe`, and file system enumeration.

Repeated 'Security Group Management' tasks are unusual, and the presence of PowerShell usage (process access, file creation, registry modification) combined with SDXHelper.exe image loading, 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' executions, and the creation of PowerShell startup profile data points to a possible attacker leveraging system tools.
