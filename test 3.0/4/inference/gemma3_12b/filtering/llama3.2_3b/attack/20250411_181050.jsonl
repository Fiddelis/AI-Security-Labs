The use of temporary files and filenames like 'componente_base_calc', 'modulo_logico_calc_decoded', and similar patterns is indicative of a staged deployment or extraction of a payload.  Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` alongside the `certutil` commands suggest a likely malicious workflow. The presence of `SDXHelper.exe` and `urlmon.dll` loading further suggests potential download or injection activity.  Finally, frequent registry modifications from `chrome.exe` may indicate malware persistence or information theft.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
