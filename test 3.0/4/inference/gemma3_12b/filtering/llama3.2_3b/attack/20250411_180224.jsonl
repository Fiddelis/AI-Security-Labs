This suggests an attempt to run unsigned or untrusted PowerShell code with elevated privileges. Multiple instances of scheduled task creation and queries, along with PowerShell script execution, strongly indicate potential malicious activity. The usage of `whoami.exe` further suggests reconnaissance activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
