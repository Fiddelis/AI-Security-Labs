These scripts appear to be non-existent, suggesting a potential attempt to obfuscate malicious activity or test persistence mechanisms. The use of `schtasks` to create scheduled tasks run as `SYSTEM` is highly suspicious. Multiple registry modifications and process creations by `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `schtasks.exe` combined with numerous Chrome registry modifications further warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
