The use of unusual task names (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon') combined with `system` user and `onlogon`\/`onstart` triggers is suspicious. The creation of files in `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks` further elevates concern, as this is a common location for malicious persistence mechanisms. While `calc.exe` is present, it could be a decoy. The repeated registry modifications across multiple processes also warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
