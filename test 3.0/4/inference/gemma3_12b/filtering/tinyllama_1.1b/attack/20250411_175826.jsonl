The pattern of manipulating file last write times suggests an attempt to evade detection or alter timestamps for malicious purposes. The repetitive file path patterns in these commands also hint at a potentially automated process.  While some events seem benign (e.g., Calculator.exe), the combination of PowerShell activity and file timestamp manipulation warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
