{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' setting registry values repeatedly without additional context could indicate persistence mechanisms or misuse. Additionally, the loading of system libraries by 'chrome.exe' and file creation actions by 'winlogbeat.exe' and 'powershell.exe' are noteworthy as they could be indicative of legitimate activity or exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repetitive Registry Modifications**: The frequent registry modifications associated with `chrome.exe` suggest potential persistence mechanisms, which is a common tactic in malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Image Loading by Chrome**: The loading of system libraries (`amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) by `chrome.exe` is unusual and could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures or exploit legitimate processes for execution.\n\n3. **File Creation Activities**: Actions by `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` creating files can be benign but might also signal unauthorized scripting or automation activities, especially if occurring in a pattern without clear justification.\n\n4. **Lack of Contextual Clarity**: The events lack additional context that could clarify whether these actions are part of legitimate operations (e.g., software updates) or potential threats.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests the batch warrants further investigation to determine whether any malicious activity is taking place, hence the classification as \"INTERESTING\". The confidence level reflects a high likelihood of interest but acknowledges some uncertainty due to possible benign explanations."}
