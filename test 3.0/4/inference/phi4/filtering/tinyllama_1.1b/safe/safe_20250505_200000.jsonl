The frequent setting of registry values suggests potential unauthorized modifications. Additionally, there are image load events from WindowsCamera.exe and other processes loading urlmon.dll, raising suspicion due to the uncommon use of this DLL in typical applications like cameras. Special logon events without clear process information may indicate unauthorized access attempts or misuse of system credentials.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
