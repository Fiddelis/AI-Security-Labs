These are typically associated with runtime environments, not standard Excel operations. Additionally, there is repeated creation of a file named real_values.csv.LNK in the user's AppData directory, which could indicate an attempt to manipulate or create shortcuts for unauthorized access. The DNS query from EXCEL.EXE further raises suspicion as it suggests potential network communication that is uncommon for regular Excel usage.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
