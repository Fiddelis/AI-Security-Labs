So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is common, but the command lines might be important. One of them has a command that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems like a potential red flag because it's looking for sensitive information, which could be part of a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, which is normal, but the presence of Windows Defender DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll might be okay. However, the deletion of a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1) could be an attempt to clean up after running a script, which is sometimes done by malicious actors.\n\nAlso, there are several Registry value set events, but they're spread across different processes, including chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome's registry changes might be benign, but if they're part of a larger pattern, they could be concerning. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with the same command line might indicate that the PowerShell script is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a persistent mechanism or to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this together, the key points are the search for passwords in files, the deletion of a temporary script, and the multiple PowerShell executions. These could be signs of an attacker trying to find sensitive data and then covering their tracks. However, there's not enough evidence to confirm it's definitely malicious, but the combination of these events makes it worth investigating further. The confidence is moderate, so I'd say \"INTERESTING\" with around 0.7 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for sensitive data (e.g., 'password' in files) combined with file deletion and registry modifications suggest potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's a legitimate process, part of the Beats framework, so probably normal. Then there's chrome.exe doing various things like setting registry values, loading images, and network connections. Some of these might be normal, but the repeated registry events could be a red flag. However, chrome.exe is a common browser, so maybe it's just regular behavior.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creating files. The paths are in the Downloads folder, which is typical for user activities. But then there's a command line in cmd.exe that uses schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. That seems suspicious because deleting scheduled tasks might be part of a cleanup, but if done without user knowledge, it could be malicious. The command line uses \/c to run a command and deletes two tasks. The names \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\" are a bit generic, but maybe they're just regular tasks. However, the use of schtasks in this way could be part of an attack to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe, which is a normal command to get user info. The WMIC.exe processes are loading dlls like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. AMSI is related to antivirus, so maybe that's part of a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers use WMIC for malicious purposes. Also, the use of wmic to delete notepad.exe processes might be an attempt to remove something, but not sure if that's malicious here.\n\nLooking at the repeated ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. That could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate processes, which is a common attack vector. Also, the svchost.exe and conhost.exe registry events might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, they could be part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother point is the multiple instances of winlogbeat.exe creating the same file. That might be a normal log file creation, but if it's happening multiple times, maybe it's being tampered with or there's some issue.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a mix of normal processes and some suspicious activities like deleting scheduled tasks, multiple registry changes, and process accesses. The use of cmd.exe and WMIC to manipulate processes and tasks might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or set up persistence. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including deletion of scheduled tasks via schtasks, repeated process access attempts by powershell.exe, and WMIC commands that could indicate process manipulation or cleanup. These activities may suggest an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or evade detection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems odd because WMIC is typically used for WMI commands, and loading a Defender DLL might be part of legitimate processes, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with cmd.exe and powershell.exe. The command lines show deletion of user accounts like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\". Deleting user accounts isn't inherently malicious, but when combined with other actions, it could be part of a larger attack, like removing access points or cleaning up after an exploit.\n\nThere's also a use of net.exe and net1.exe to delete users, which might be part of the same activity. The sc.exe command deleting a service called \"win32times\" is suspicious. Deleting services can be a step in compromising a system, maybe to remove monitoring tools or other security services.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent rules suggests that someone is trying to access or modify processes and registry settings. The \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with empty commands might be noise or part of some automated tooling, but they don't seem harmful on their own.\n\nThe most concerning part is the combination of user deletions and service deletion. Legitimate administrative tasks sometimes involve deleting users or services, but the frequency and the specific commands here might indicate an attempt to manipulate the system. However, without more context like unusual network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit hard to be certain. But considering the multiple suspicious commands and the use of tools like WMIC and PowerShell, this batch does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of user accounts via 'net user \/del', deletion of a system service ('sc delete win32times'), and use of WMIC.exe loading a Defender DLL (potentially legitimate but contextually unusual).

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe loading various system files like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are all .NET Framework files, which are legitimate. But why are they being loaded by PowerShell? Typically, PowerShell is used for scripting, but loading these DLLs might be part of normal operations, like running .NET applications. However, I should check if there's any suspicious activity here. The paths are all standard Windows directories, so that's probably okay.\n\nThen there's an event where PowerShell sets a registry value. Registry changes can be benign, but if done in a way that's unusual, it might be a red flag. However, without more context, like what the registry key is or what value was changed, it's hard to say. The same goes for the ProcessAccess events. These might just be normal process monitoring, but if there's a pattern, like repeated access to certain processes, that could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. However, the filename has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file. Not sure if that's significant here.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a standard command to display user information, so that's usually harmless. But if it's being run in a context where it shouldn't be, like from a malicious script, that could be an issue. However, the logs don't show any unusual command-line arguments beyond the standard.\n\nOther processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe have registry events. These are common system processes, and registry changes can be part of their normal functioning. However, again, without knowing the specifics of the registry changes, it's hard to determine if they're malicious.\n\nThe Chrome entries show DNS queries and network connections. This is normal for a browser, so unless there's an unusual domain being queried or a connection to a known malicious IP, it's probably not a concern.\n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events seem to be related to normal system operations and legitimate processes. The PowerShell activities involve loading system DLLs, which is common in .NET environments. The registry and process access events don't have clear indicators of compromise. The winlogbeat activity is part of its normal setup. The whoami.exe calls are standard. The Chrome activity is typical.\n\nHowever, there's a concentration of PowerShell events, which could be a point of interest. But since all the files involved are legitimate and the tasks are standard, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. Without additional context like unexpected command-line arguments, unusual network activity, or changes to critical registry keys, it's hard to classify this as suspicious.\n\nSo, the classification here would likely be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show signs of malicious activity. The confidence is moderate, around 0.6, since while there's a lot of PowerShell activity, it's all within normal system boundaries. The justification is that the events involve standard system processes and legitimate file paths without clear indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve standard system processes (e.g., PowerShell loading .NET DLLs, Chrome DNS queries) and legitimate operations (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation). No clear indicators of compromise, malicious payloads, or anomalous behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
