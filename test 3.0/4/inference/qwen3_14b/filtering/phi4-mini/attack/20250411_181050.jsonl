{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, maybe browsing. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a legitimate command to check user identity, but sometimes used in attacks. Then powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes. The cmd.exe entry has a command line with certutil -encode and -decode. Wait, certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding files, but in malicious contexts, it can be used to execute payloads. The command line here is using certutil to encode calc.exe into a temp file and then decode it back. That's suspicious because encoding and decoding files can be part of obfuscating malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of certutil.exe being run with encode and decode commands. Also, there's a file created in the temp directory named modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe. That's a red flag because decoded files might be malware. The event with File Executable Detected points to that temp file, which is unusual. \n\nThen there's rundll32.exe executing a DLL, which can be a sign of DLL hijacking or malicious code. SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll—those are legitimate system DLLs, but if they're being loaded from unexpected places or in unusual contexts, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so maybe that's normal. \n\nChrome.exe has several registry value set events and network connections. Multiple network connections from chrome might be normal if it's browsing, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate something else. The powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder named componente_auxiliar.txt—maybe that's benign, but if it's part of a larger attack, it's concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding, the creation of a decoded executable in the temp folder, multiple process creations and registry changes, and network activity. These could indicate an attempt to execute a payload, possibly malware. Even though some processes like chrome and whoami are normal, the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the certutil usage and decoded files are strong indicators of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (common in malware obfuscation), creation of decoded executable in temp directory, registry modifications, and unusual process executions (e.g., rundll32 with PcaSvc.dll). These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it might be setting up configuration files. The path is in the user's Downloads folder, which is common for installations.\n\nThen there are three events related to powershell.exe. The first is a registry value set, and the other two are process accesses. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but those events could also be part of malicious activity. However, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected registry changes, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe key point here is that all events are related to normal system processes. Winlogbeat creating a config file and PowerShell performing standard operations don't immediately indicate a security threat. There's no mention of suspicious file paths, unexpected network activity, or other red flags. The classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" since there's no clear malicious behavior in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events relate to normal system processes (winlogbeat configuration file creation and PowerShell operations) without indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
