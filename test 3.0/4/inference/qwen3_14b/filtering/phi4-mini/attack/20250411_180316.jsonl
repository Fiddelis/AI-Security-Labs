Then there's powershell.exe appearing multiple times. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be a vector for attacks. The events mention 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set', which might be normal, but I need to check for anomalies.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there's a mention of urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. These are system files, so loading them might be normal. However, the presence of WMIC.exe and cmd.exe with commands like deleting processes (notepad.exe) could be suspicious.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them involve PowerShell and other processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and chrome.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. \n\nHmm, I notice that there's a lot of activity with PowerShell. Specifically, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is accessing processes, modifying the registry, and loading images. One of the entries shows a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1, and then immediately deleted. That seems suspicious. Creating and deleting a script file in the Temp folder could be part of an attack where the script is executed and then cleaned up to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are several instances of the \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks with PowerShell commands like \"& {}\", which might be placeholders or test commands. But combined with the file creation and deletion, this might indicate someone testing or running a script that's supposed to be temporary.\n\nAnother thing is the Image loaded events pointing to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET files, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a red flag. However, since PowerShell is a legitimate process, this might not be malicious on its own.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe being executed could be part of a normal process, but if it's done in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of an attack to gather information.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these events are normal. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating temporary files is normal. But the combination of multiple registry changes, process accesses, and the creation\/deletion of a script file might indicate something more. \n\nWait, the script file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which sounds like a test script, maybe related to testing script policies. If this is part of a legitimate test, then it's not malicious. But without more context, the fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly might be a sign of an attacker trying to execute a script and remove evidence.\n\nAlso, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command might be part of a tool or process that's being monitored, but again, could be benign. However, the overall pattern of multiple suspicious activities in a short time frame could be worth investigating.\n\nI need to balance between normal operations and potential threats. Since there's a file created and deleted in Temp, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces, this might be a sign of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. The classification should be \"interesting\" because there are indicators that could be related to an attack, even if they might be benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several **suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation, though they may not definitively indicate a security breach. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A PowerShell process creates a script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`) in the user's Temp directory, then deletes it shortly afterward. This pattern is common in **malware or attacker activity** to execute scripts and remove traces.\n\n2. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries involve PowerShell executing commands (`& {}`), accessing processes, modifying the registry, and creating\/deleting files. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, **excessive or unusual usage** (especially with temporary files) can signal exploitation or script-based attacks.\n\n3. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Repeated entries with tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" using the same command (`powershell.exe & {}`) may indicate **tooling or monitoring activity**, though this could also be benign.\n\n4. **Image Load Events:**\n   - PowerShell loads .NET assemblies (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). While legitimate, this could be part of **exploiting PowerShell for malicious purposes** if combined with other anomalous behavior.\n\n### **Contextual Considerations:**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases:** \n  - Temporary script creation\/deletion could be part of **legitimate testing** (e.g., checking script policy enforcement). \n  - PowerShell is widely used for administrative tasks, and the .NET image loads are normal for many applications.\n\n- **Red Flags:**\n  - The **lack of clear context** (e.g., no explicit user action or documentation) makes the activity ambiguous.\n  - The **script file's name** (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...`) suggests a test, but the combination with deletion and repeated PowerShell activity raises suspicion.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **interesting enough for investigation** due to the combination of temporary file creation\/deletion, PowerShell activity, and lifecycle events. While these actions could be benign, they **align with patterns seen in adversarial activity** (e.g., script execution followed by cleanup). Further analysis (e.g., correlating with user behavior, checking for additional logs, or inspecting the script content if recovered) is recommended. \n\n**Recommendation:** Flag for review by a security analyst or SOC team to determine if this represents a legitimate test or potential compromise."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the entries, there are several PowerShell.exe processes with various winlog tasks. The first event mentions an image loaded from the Windows Defender path, which seems legitimate. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData directory, which could be normal, but maybe not always. Then there are registry value sets and process accesses. \n\nWait, there are multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The command lines use Test-Path to check if these scripts exist, then exit 0 or 1. That seems odd because why would someone check for these scripts? Maybe trying to see if they're present before doing something else. \n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events pointing to .dll files related to .NET Framework, which are normal for PowerShell. But the repeated checks for specific .bat files in different directories might indicate probing or looking for existing scripts. The user might be trying to determine if certain files are present, possibly as part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of a payload or a backdoor.\n\nAnother thing is that the user is using PowerShell in a way that's not typical for regular operations. The use of Provider Lifecycle events might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but combined with the Test-Path checks, it could be part of an attack chain. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, like downloading files, executing payloads, or connecting to external IPs. It's more about checking for the existence of files. But the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are doing this across different paths might be suspicious. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the pattern of checking for specific scripts in various locations could be a red flag.

There's a file deletion of a script in the Temp directory, which might be normal, but then there's a file creation in Downloads. However, the more concerning parts are the registry value sets by chrome.exe. Wait, chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much. But looking at the logs, there are multiple registry events from chrome.exe. That's unusual. But maybe it's just a lot of legitimate activity? However, the number of registry events is high, which could indicate something malicious.\n\nThen, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. That's normal, but there's also a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might be benign, but in combination with other events?\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of certain files and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a larger script, but not necessarily malicious. However, there's an entry where PowerShell is creating a new item and setting content to a file, which could be writing a script. The path here is \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\componente_temporario_script.bat\" and another one with \"dir\" as the content. That seems suspicious because creating a batch file with \"dir\" isn't harmful on its own, but the pattern of creating files and modifying the registry might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the repetition of registry events from chrome.exe is a red flag. Chrome shouldn't be setting registry values that frequently. It could be a sign of a compromised browser or a malicious extension. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be worth investigating.\n\nI need to check if there's any pattern of malicious activity. The creation of temporary scripts, registry modifications, and multiple image loads might indicate a multi-stage attack. The presence of both file creation and deletion could be part of cleaning up after an attack.

Each command uses New-Item and Set-Content to create or modify .bat files. The paths mentioned seem to be in various directories, some of which might be unusual or part of a pattern. The command lines are similar, with a structure that creates a file and then sets its content to \"dir\". \n\nWait, the paths have \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. That might be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created in different locations could indicate an attempt to persist or spread malicious activity. \n\nThen there's the File created and File Delete logged events. A temporary file is created and then deleted. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger scheme. \n\nThe registry value set events and image loaded events (like mscoree.dll, clrjit.dll) are part of .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, but if there's unexpected loading, it could be a sign of something malicious. \n\nHowever, I don't see any direct evidence of malware here, like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or executing malicious code. The commands are creating batch files with \"dir\" commands, which is a basic directory listing.

The use of ..\\ could be trying to access parent directories, possibly to evade detection or to place files in unexpected locations. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, the activities are somewhat suspicious due to the file creation and registry changes. On the other hand, without more context like actual malicious payloads or network activity, it's hard to confirm. However, the multiple PowerShell events with directory traversal and file creation might be enough to flag this as potentially malicious. \n\nSo, I think the answer would be that this is interesting for investigation because of the suspicious file operations and potential persistence mechanisms, even though there's no direct evidence of malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs presents **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, though it does not definitively indicate malware. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity with File Creation:**\n   - Multiple `PowerShell` processes execute commands to **create or modify `.bat` files** across various directories (e.g., `C:\\modulo_comum\\...`, `C:\\componente_geral\\...`). \n   - The commands use `New-Item` and `Set-Content` to write files with the content `\"dir\"` (a basic directory listing). While this alone is not inherently malicious, the **repetition across different paths** and the use of `..\\` (directory traversal) raises concerns about **potential persistence mechanisms** or **testing access to restricted directories**.\n\n2. **Directory Traversal (`..\\`):**\n   - The use of `..\\` in file paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base\\..\\entrada_base\\...`) suggests an attempt to **traverse directory structures**, which could be an attempt to evade detection or access sensitive areas of the file system.\n\n3. **Registry and Image Load Events:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events and `Image loaded` events (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are logged. While these are normal for PowerShell\/.NET operations, their **frequency** and **lack of clear purpose** (e.g., no associated process creation or network activity) could indicate **unusual behavior**.\n\n4. **File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted, which could be part of **legitimate PowerShell profile setup** but may also be a tactic to **obfuscate malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- The **pattern of file creation** across multiple directories with `..\\` may indicate **attempts to persist or escalate privileges**.\n- The **absence of clear benign context** (e.g., no user interaction, no legitimate script execution) raises concerns about **potential lateral movement or reconnaissance**.\n- The **repetition of similar PowerShell commands** could suggest **automation or testing** (e.g., checking if certain directories are writeable).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation**. While no direct evidence of malware is present (e.g., no network exfiltration, no payload execution), the **unusual file operations, registry changes, and PowerShell usage** suggest potential **malicious intent** or **misconfigured scripts**. A deeper dive into the context (e.g., user accounts, network traffic, file contents) is recommended. \n\n**Classification:** 🟡 **Suspicious – Investigate Further**."}

There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist, like \"Test-Path\" with various paths. For example, the first event checks if \"tarefa_ativo.exe\" exists and exits 0 or 1 based on that. Similar patterns repeat with different filenames. \n\nNow, why would someone do that?

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe' entries. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool that displays user information, so that's probably normal. But the repeated 'powershell.exe' events might be more concerning. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks: most are 'Process accessed', 'Process Create', 'Image loaded', and some 'Registry value set'. The 'Image loaded' events mention files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but then there's an entry for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file too, but maybe the fact that it's being loaded by PowerShell could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there are several 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events. The file created is a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating and then immediately deleting a temp file could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious scripts. However, the script content isn't shown here, so it's hard to tell. The command lines in some processes involve Test-Path commands checking for specific CS files.

Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Use:** Multiple `powershell.exe` processes are logged, including `File created`, `File Delete logged`, and `Pipe Created` events. This is common in environments with scripting, but the combination with temporary file creation\/deletion (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) raises mild concern. Such files are often used in script execution, but their deletion afterward suggests transient operations (could be benign or obfuscation).\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created and deleted in the user's `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. While this could be part of normal PowerShell policy testing or automation, the lack of context (e.g., no script content, no clear purpose) makes it ambiguous.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:**\n   - `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component) is loaded by PowerShell. While legitimate, this could indicate an attempt to interact with security software (e.g., bypassing protections, checking defender status).\n\n4. **Path Patterns:**\n   - Multiple `Test-Path` commands check for `.cs` files in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\...`). These paths are not typical for system files and may indicate custom applications or potential malicious activity (e.g., probing for sensitive files).\n\n5. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No direct evidence of malware (e.g., network connections, suspicious binaries, or privilege escalation) is present. The activity appears to be limited to file checks and temporary script handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict:**\n**Potentially Interesting (Moderate Risk)**  \nThe logs exhibit behaviors that are **not inherently malicious** but **deviate from typical user activity** and could indicate **exploratory or obfuscation tactics**. The repeated use of PowerShell for file checks, temporary script handling, and interaction with security-related DLLs warrants closer scrutiny, especially if this is part of a larger pattern of anomalous behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional context (e.g., network activity, user behavior, or system changes) around the timestamps of these events.\n- **Inspect Script Content:** If possible, analyze the contents of the deleted temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) to determine its purpose.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage:** Implement logging or monitoring for PowerShell commands, especially those involving file system operations or interaction with security tools.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 65% (Moderate) – The logs are not definitively malicious but show patterns that merit further investigation."}

However, in these logs, the Test-Path commands are just checking if the file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a legitimate script, but it's also a common technique used by malware to check for presence of payloads.\n\nThe repeated checks in different directories might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a specific script, possibly to execute it later. Also, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are creating and deleting temporary files could be part of an attempt to obfuscate their activities or execute scripts without leaving traces.\n\nHowever, none of the events show actual execution of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script, just checking for its existence. The presence of Windows Defender files being loaded is normal. The confidence here is moderate because while the behavior is suspicious, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity yet. It's more of a potential indicator that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' across various paths, which is a common pattern in malware reconnaissance.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a task \"Pipe Created\". Not sure about that yet. Then there are a couple of processes where the command line checks if a certain PowerShell script exists. The paths mentioned are \"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\\\unidade_logico...\". These paths look a bit odd. They don't seem like standard directories. Maybe the attacker is using non-standard paths to hide files?\n\nNext, there's winlogbeat creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's normal, but maybe if there's a lot of such activity, but here it's just one instance. Then, multiple entries about PowerShell processes being accessed, which could be normal, but combined with other events might be suspicious.\n\nThe \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" script name stands out. Keystrokes usually relate to keylogging, which is malicious. The fact that the PowerShell commands are checking for the existence of this script might indicate that the attacker is trying to determine if the script is present, possibly to execute it later. However, in these logs, the commands just exit 0 or 1 based on the presence, not actually running the script. But that could be a precursor to execution.\n\nOther events include whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool for checking user identity, but if used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. There are also entries for notepad.exe and calc.exe, which are normal, but the image loaded events for urlmon.dll are standard as well.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries show network connections and DNS queries. Multiple network connections could be normal browsing, but if there's a pattern or connection to known malicious IPs, that would be a red flag. However, the logs don't specify the destination IPs or domains, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThe repeated \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which could be part of a compromise. However, without more context, it's hard to confirm.\n\nPutting this all together: The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests potential keylogging, which is malicious. The PowerShell commands checking for the script's existence might be part of an attack lifecycle. However, the logs don't show the script being executed, just checked. The other events are mostly normal system activities. The confidence level is moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they aren't conclusive on their own.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be suspicious. The first event is 'whoami.exe' which is a legitimate command to get user info, but maybe not a big red flag on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for 'powershell.exe' with tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Image Loaded. The Image Load events mention loading .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET framework, which is normal. However, there's also a mention of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That might be a legitimate file, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate files.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute something and then clean up. The file name is a PowerShell script, which could be benign, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the command line for powershell.exe includes 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These commands are used to list files recursively, which could be part of a script that's searching for something on the system. That's not inherently malicious, but combined with other activities, it might indicate reconnaissance.\n\nThere's also an entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's normal if someone is using it for monitoring, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be part of PowerShell's normal operations, but without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple registry modifications and image loads could indicate that the system is being probed or that a script is modifying system settings.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell executing recursive commands, creating and deleting temporary files, loading various DLLs (some of which are from Defender), and multiple registry changes might be indicative of a script that's either benign (like a cleanup or diagnostic tool) or potentially malicious (like a script gathering information or preparing for an attack). However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like connecting to a C2 server, downloading files, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. But the suspicious pattern of file creation and deletion, along with the high volume of PowerShell activity, might warrant further investigation. So I'd say it's interesting enough to look into more.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown of key observations:\n\n### **1. PowerShell Activity (High Frequency)**\n- **Recursive File Enumeration**: Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing commands like `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, and `gci -recurse`. This could indicate:\n  - **Legitimate Use**: System diagnostics, file inventory, or script execution.\n  - **Suspicious Behavior**: Reconnaissance for lateral movement, data exfiltration, or identifying sensitive files (e.g., `.pem`, `.key` files).\n\n- **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n  - A temporary PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted. This pattern is commonly used by malware to execute payloads and avoid detection.\n\n### **2. Image Load Events**\n- **Legitimate DLLs**: References to `.NET` framework DLLs (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `MpClient.dll`) are normal.\n- **Windows Defender DLLs**: `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` are part of Windows Defender. While legitimate, their presence could be mimicked by malware to evade detection.\n\n### **3. Registry Modifications**\n- Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggest potential attempts to modify system settings or inject code. This requires correlation with specific registry keys to determine legitimacy.\n\n### **4. Winlogbeat Activity**\n- A file creation event for `winlogbeat.yml.new` (a log configuration file) is logged. While Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, unexpected changes to its configuration could indicate tampering or misuse.\n\n### **5. \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" Events**\n- These are internal PowerShell events and may not be inherently malicious. However, their repetition could indicate abnormal PowerShell usage patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Worth Investigating Further?**\n**Yes.** The combination of:\n- **High-frequency PowerShell activity** with recursive commands,\n- **File creation\/deletion in transient directories**,\n- **Unusual registry modifications**, and\n- **Potential mimicry of legitimate processes** (e.g., Defender DLLs),\n\nsuggests either:\n- A **malicious script** (e.g., data exfiltration, persistence setup), or\n- **Misconfigured tools** (e.g., accidental script execution, misconfigured logging).\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for network activity (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Look for additional file modifications or process injections.\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Examine the content of the deleted temporary script (if recoverable).\n   - Check for obfuscation or use of `Invoke-Expression`\/`IEX`.\n3. **Inspect Registry Changes**:\n   - Identify which registry keys were modified and their purpose.\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Monitor for credentials dumping, Kerberos ticket manipulation, or SMB activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile not definitively malicious, the log entries exhibit **patterns consistent with adversarial activity**. Further analysis is required to confirm whether this represents a **legitimate operational task** or a **potential security incident**."}

Not suspicious yet.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. This seems legitimate too.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe setting a registry value. Registry changes can be risky, but again, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.
