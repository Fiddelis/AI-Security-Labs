The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not a red flag yet. But then I see several entries involving powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I need to check what's happening here.\n\nLooking at one of the PowerShell events, there's a command line that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub URL. The URLs mentioned are all from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is a common place for hosting text files. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files multiple times might be worth noting. But wait, the filenames downloaded are things like LICENSE.txt, which are common in repositories. That might be benign, but the repetition could be a clue.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell is creating and deleting files in the Temp directory. Creating a temporary file and then deleting it is something that can happen during normal operations, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be suspicious. Also, the fact that there are multiple downloads from different GitHub repos might indicate that someone is trying to execute scripts or download payloads.\n\nAnother point is the image loaded events for PowerShell. The DLLs loaded are part of the .NET Framework, which is standard. So that doesn't seem suspicious. However, the combination of multiple file creations, registry changes, and network activity could indicate something more. \n\nWait, there's also a registry value set event for PowerShell. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. The key thing here is the number of PowerShell-related events. There are several Process Create, Image Load, File Create, and File Delete events. That's a lot of activity for a single process, which might be indicative of malicious behavior, especially if it's doing multiple downloads and modifying the system.\n\nBut then again, some of these could be part of legitimate scripts. However, the repeated use of WebClient to download files from GitHub, combined with creating and deleting temporary files, might be a sign of something like a script that's trying to execute code or download payloads. The fact that the same pattern is repeated multiple times with different URLs could be a red flag. \n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry events and network connections might suggest that the system is being probed or that there's an attempt to establish persistence. However, I should also consider that some of these could be false positives or part of normal system operations. But given the volume and variety of events, especially the multiple downloads and file operations, this seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities involving downloading files, creating\/deleting temporary files, and registry changes is more than just normal behavior. It's likely worth looking into to determine if it's malicious or just a benign script that's being overzealous.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Suspicious Patterns:\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Multiple downloads** from `raw.githubusercontent.com` using `WebClient` (e.g., `LICENSE.txt` files). While GitHub is legitimate, downloading files repeatedly from different repositories raises concerns about **data exfiltration** or **script execution**.\n   - **File creation\/deletion** in temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`, `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Temp`), which could indicate **temporary payload storage** or **cleanup after malicious activity**.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for both `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe`. While registry changes are normal, **unauthorized modifications** could signal **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries).\n\n3. **Network and Process Behavior**:\n   - **Frequent DNS queries** and **network connections** from `chrome.exe` (normal for a browser) but combined with PowerShell's activity, it may indicate **coordinated lateral movement** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n4. **High Volume of Events**:\n   - The sheer number of PowerShell-related events (Process Create, File Create\/Delete, Pipe Created) suggests **automated or scripted behavior**, which is often associated with **malware** or **reconnaissance**.\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- **Unusual PowerShell usage** for downloading files from GitHub (common in benign contexts but risky when unexplained).\n- **Temporary file creation\/deletion** patterns that could mask malicious payloads.\n- **Registry changes** without clear justification.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- **Investigate the PowerShell scripts** being executed (e.g., check for obfuscation, command-line arguments, or loaded modules).\n- **Monitor the downloaded files** for malicious content (e.g., using antivirus tools or YARA rules).\n- **Check for unauthorized user activity** or lateral movement via network logs.\n- **Validate the legitimacy** of GitHub repositories referenced in the downloads.\n\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and merits immediate forensic analysis."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple instances of chrome.exe with registry value set events. That's normal, maybe part of regular operations. But then there's a powershell.exe event where it's loading a DLL from the Windows Defender path. Wait, that's a legitimate file, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a command line in powershell.exe that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. Hmm, GitHub can be used for legitimate purposes, but sometimes malicious scripts are hosted there. The filename is LICENSE.txt, which is common, but the path is temp, so maybe that's okay. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files could be a red flag, especially if it's not part of normal user activity.\n\nThen, there are several file creation events, like the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. That might be normal PowerShell startup scripts. But another entry shows winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files could be part of its normal operation. However, if this is unexpected, it might be worth looking into.\n\nLooking further, there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe, which might indicate someone trying to manipulate the process. Also, the cmd.exe command trying to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\" with \/F. Deleting a task could be part of cleaning up after a malicious activity, which is suspicious. The command is run with >nul 2>&1 to suppress output, which is often done to hide the action.\n\nOther entries include svchost.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for handling URLs. That seems normal. However, multiple registry value set events from various processes might indicate some configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: the most suspicious parts are the PowerShell download from GitHub, the attempt to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn,\" and the multiple process access events. The deletion of a task named \"spawn\" is particularly concerning because \"spawn\" could be a hint at a backdoor or persistent mechanism. The fact that the user is trying to delete it might indicate they're trying to remove evidence.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, and Winlogbeat creating configuration files is normal. But the combination of downloading a file, deleting a task, and multiple process accesses raises a red flag.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of schtasks.exe with the command to delete a task named \"spawn\".

The registry modifications, especially under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, are red flags. That's where malware often adds persistence. Also, the command line for reg.exe is deleting a registry value named \"pacote_auxiliar\" which might be part of removing traces. The repeated use of PowerShell and the loading of .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll could indicate malicious code execution.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, that's a legitimate file. Defender's MpOAV.dll is part of the antivirus, so that's normal. Maybe a false positive?\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script. Then immediately deleted. That could be a red flag. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. But sometimes temporary files are normal, so need to check more.\n\nThen there's a pipe created, but no file involved. Not sure yet. The command line with 'powershell.exe & {}' seems odd. That might be a way to execute commands without leaving a clear trail. The 'Provider Lifecycle' events repeated multiple times might indicate something, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of registry value sets and process accesses. PowerShell is involved in many of these. The user is running 'whoami.exe' which is normal for checking user context. But the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, including creating and deleting files, might be suspicious.\n\nThe key points here are the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, multiple PowerShell process creations, and the use of 'powershell.exe & {}' which could be a way to bypass security policies.

So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading DLLs like clrjit.dll, MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll, mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are all legitimate system files, part of .NET and Windows Defender. But why are they being loaded by PowerShell? Usually, PowerShell is used for scripting, but loading these DLLs might be part of normal operations, but maybe not always.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a temp file isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious code, that's a red flag. However, here it's just a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which sounds like a test script. But the fact that it's created and then deleted might be suspicious if it's part of an attempt to execute something temporarily.\n\nThere are also several registry value set events from PowerShell and Chrome. Registry changes can be benign, but if they're modifying security-related keys or adding persistence mechanisms, that's a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The Chrome entries are all registry changes, but since Chrome is a common application, maybe it's just normal operations. However, the repetition of registry events might indicate something.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a line that says 'powershell.exe & {}' which is an empty script block. That might be a placeholder or a test. Another entry has a command line that removes a zip file from the Temp directory. That's a normal operation unless it's part of a larger malicious activity, like cleaning up after an attack.\n\nThe presence of multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events from PowerShell could indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute code or load modules. However, PowerShell is a legitimate tool, so this isn't necessarily malicious. But when combined with other events, like file creation and deletion, it might be part of a more complex scenario.\n\nI also notice that some of the DLLs loaded are from Windows Defender, which could be part of a legitimate scan or update. However, if PowerShell is loading these DLLs in an unusual way, it might be an indicator of compromise.\n\nThe repetition of events, especially the registry changes from Chrome and PowerShell, might be normal, but the combination of file creation\/deletion and image loading could be suspicious. However, without more context, like network activity or other system logs, it's hard to be certain. But given that PowerShell is involved in creating and deleting files and loading various DLLs, it's possible that this is a legitimate script or test. However, the fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly might be a sign of an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nOverall, while some of these events are normal, the combination of file operations and registry changes by PowerShell could warrant further investigation. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but there are enough suspicious elements to consider it interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious activity**, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Legitimate DLL Loading**: PowerShell loads system DLLs like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscoreei.dll` (part of .NET runtime). This is common during script execution or .NET-based operations.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion**: A temporary PowerShell script (`objeto_principal.zip`) is created and deleted. While this could be a benign test, it aligns with patterns seen in **malicious scripts** that execute payloads and clean up traces.\n   - **Command-Line Indicators**: The command `Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip` suggests cleanup after execution, which is often seen in **malware** or **post-exploitation activities**.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple **registry value set** events from PowerShell and Chrome. While Chrome's activity could be normal, repeated PowerShell registry changes may indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries, modifying policies).\n\n3. **Windows Defender DLLs**:\n   - Loading `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components) might be part of **legitimate scans**, but PowerShell loading these DLLs directly is unusual and could hint at **DLL hijacking** or **tampering**.\n\n4. **Empty Script Block**:\n   - The command `powershell.exe & {}` (empty script) is ambiguous. It could be a **placeholder**, **test**, or a **malicious obfuscation technique**.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns**\n- **File Creation + Deletion**: The temporary script file (`objeto_principal.zip`) being created and deleted rapidly is a **common tactic in malware** to avoid detection.\n- **Repetitive Registry Changes**: Frequent registry modifications by PowerShell without clear context may indicate **persistence or configuration changes**.\n- **Unusual DLL Loading**: PowerShell loading Windows Defender DLLs directly (not via standard processes) could suggest **tampering** or **exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., .NET DLL loading) is normal, the combination of **file creation\/deletion**, **registry modifications**, and **unusual PowerShell behavior** raises **red flags**. These could indicate:\n- **Malicious scripting** (e.g., downloading and executing payloads).\n- **Persistence attempts** (e.g., modifying registry for long-term access).\n- **Indicator of compromise** (e.g., cleanup after execution).\n\n**Recommendation**: Correlate these logs with:\n- **Network traffic** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n- **User behavior** (e.g., unusual login times or user accounts).\n- **System integrity checks** (e.g., file hashes of involved DLLs and scripts).\n\nFurther analysis is required to confirm benignity or malicious intent."}

The files created are temporary scripts like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1.

Chrome having multiple Registry value sets might be normal, but it's worth noting. However, the majority of suspicious activity is still around PowerShell.\n\nWait, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That path is part of PowerShell's startup profiles, which could be a red flag if it's being modified without user knowledge.

If that's unusual for the environment, it might be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The key here is that the majority of events are related to PowerShell, which is a common vector for attacks. The combination of multiple ImageLoads, FileCreates, and Deletes could indicate a script being executed and cleaned up.

Therefore, I'd say this is a moderate risk and could be interesting for investigation, but not necessarily a clear-cut attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent File Operations:** Multiple `FileCreate` and `FileDelete` events in the **Temp directory** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`) suggest temporary script execution and cleanup. While common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., testing, automation), this pattern could also mask malicious activity.\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Repeated `Registry value set` events by `powershell.exe` may indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms (e.g., modifying startup policies or registry keys for persistence).\n   - **Process Access:** `ProcessAccess` events could signal attempts to interact with or monitor other processes, though this is not inherently malicious.\n\n2. **System File Loads:**\n   - **ImageLoad Events:** PowerShell loading system files like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `.NET Framework` components is typical for script execution. However, **unusual timing or volume** of such events might indicate exploitation (e.g., via PowerShell remoting or malicious payloads).\n\n3. **Other Processes:**\n   - **Chrome.exe Registry Changes:** Multiple `Registry value set` events by `chrome.exe` could be benign (e.g., extension updates) but may also hint at tampering if unrelated to user activity.\n   - **whoami.exe:** A standard utility for checking user context; no immediate concern here.\n\n4. **File Creation in PowerShell Directories:**\n   - A file created in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` might relate to PowerShell profile customization. While normal, modification of such files without user consent could indicate tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** **Moderate**. The logs do not conclusively prove malicious intent (e.g., no clear payloads, lateral movement, or exfiltration), but the **high volume of PowerShell-related file operations** and **registry changes** raises flags.\n- **Contextual Factors:** \n  - If this is part of a **known legitimate workflow** (e.g., automated testing, DevOps scripts), the activity may be benign.\n  - If **unusual for the environment** (e.g., unexpected PowerShell use, lack of user context), further investigation is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Data:**\n   - Check for **network traffic** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Review **process tree** or **parent-child relationships** to identify if PowerShell was spawned by unexpected processes.\n   - Analyze **script content** (if available) to determine if it contains malicious commands.\n\n2. **Check for Anomalies:**\n   - Investigate **unusual registry modifications** (e.g., keys related to persistence, credentials, or system configuration).\n   - Verify if **PowerShell profiles** were modified without user consent.\n\n3. **Monitor for Follow-On Activity:**\n   - Watch for **escalation of privileges**, **data exfiltration**, or **lateral movement** in subsequent logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs **merits further investigation** due to the **high volume of PowerShell activity** and **file operations** that could be indicative of either legitimate automation or early-stage malicious behavior. While not conclusive, the patterns observed align with **potential red flags** and should be analyzed in the context of broader network and system telemetry."}
