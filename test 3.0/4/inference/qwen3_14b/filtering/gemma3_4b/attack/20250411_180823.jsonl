{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me start by scanning each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not suspicious. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be okay, but notepad.exe modifying the registry could be a red flag if it's not expected. \n\nNext, powershell.exe being accessed and some process accesses. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. Then there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected place or in an unusual context, that might be an issue. However, in this case, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the standard location, so maybe that's normal.\n\nNow, looking at the cmd.exe entries. There's a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks named things like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command lines are creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon or startup. That's suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with names that look like random strings and triggering calc.exe might be part of an attack. Also, one of the tasks is set to run as the system user, which is a higher privilege. \n\nThen there's schtasks.exe creating another task called \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same pattern. The fact that multiple tasks are being created with similar naming and using calc.exe could indicate someone is trying to establish persistence. Also, the file creation events for the tasks in the System32\\Tasks directory might be normal, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it's a sign of potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries, they're modifying the registry multiple times. Svchost is a legitimate host process for Windows services, but excessive registry changes could indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The conhost.exe entry modifying the registry is also something to note, but again, it's a normal process.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious parts are the multiple scheduled tasks created by cmd.exe and schtasks.exe with unusual names, running calc.exe, and the associated registry changes. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of creating multiple tasks with seemingly random names and using calc.exe (which is a simple calculator but might be a red herring) could be a sign of an attacker trying to set up persistence. However, the confidence isn't 100% because some of these actions could be part of normal system behavior, but the pattern here is more indicative of a potential threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` processes are creating scheduled tasks with names like:\n     - `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`\n     - `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon`\n     - `pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup`\n   - These tasks are configured to execute `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe` on **system startup** or **user logon**, and some are set to run as the **system user** (high-privilege).\n   - **Why this is concerning**: The naming pattern (e.g., \"modulo_principal_005\") suggests a **non-standard, potentially malicious** task. The use of `calc.exe` as a payload is often a **red herring** (e.g., to avoid detection), but the persistence mechanism (scheduled tasks) is a clear indicator of **attempted persistence**.\n\n2. **File Creation in System32\\Tasks**:\n   - A `FileCreate` event logs the creation of a task file at `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup`. This directory is typically used by **legitimate scheduled tasks**, but the presence of an unusual file name raises suspicion.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are modifying the registry. While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate system process, **excessive or unexplained registry changes** could indicate **malware configuration** or **tampering**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Behavior**:\n- **Legitimate**: \n  - `chrome.exe` performing DNS queries and network connections is normal.\n  - `urlmon.dll` being loaded by `calc.exe` is legitimate (part of Windows Internet Explorer\/Windows Shell).\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - The **scheduled tasks** with obscure names and `calc.exe` execution are highly unusual and consistent with **malicious persistence techniques**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis activity is **likely malicious** and should be investigated further. The creation of scheduled tasks with unusual names and the use of `calc.exe` as a payload are strong indicators of **malware attempting to establish persistence** on the system. \n\n**Recommended Actions**:\n- Check the details of the scheduled tasks (e.g., their triggers, execution paths, and user context).\n- Analyze the registry changes for anomalies (e.g., unexpected keys or values).\n- Monitor for additional suspicious processes or network activity tied to these tasks.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **High** (but not 100%) â€” the pattern of activity strongly suggests a **security incident**."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are all performing registry value set operations. Some of these processes are normal, like svchost.exe and chrome.exe, but others like powershell.exe might be more concerning. However, just having registry changes isn't necessarily bad. But then I notice that there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing the same thing repeatedly. That's a lot of registry events from chrome, which might be unusual. Normally, chrome might modify the registry for its own settings, but doing it so frequently could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But then there's a file creation by powershell.exe named \"unidade_ativo.txt\" in the Downloads folder. That's a bit odd. Why would powershell create a text file there? Maybe it's just a normal user activity, but combined with other events, it could be part of something else.\n\nAnother point is the image loaded events. Chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that seems okay. But if these were loaded from unusual paths, that might be a problem. However, the paths here look standard.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event for whoami.exe. That's a standard command-line tool, so unless it's being used in an unexpected context, it's probably benign. But if it's part of a larger attack, like privilege escalation, that could be an issue. However, alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. The high number of registry changes by chrome.exe might indicate that it's being manipulated or that there's a malicious payload. Also, the creation of files via powershell.exe could be part of data exfiltration or setup. However, without more context, like network activity or unusual command-line arguments, it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple registry events and file creations might be indicative of an attacker trying to modify the system or leave behind files. But since some of these are normal processes, the confidence isn't 100%. However, the repetition and the combination of different processes accessing the registry and creating files could be a sign of something suspicious. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. There's enough activity that warrants further investigation, but not enough to be certain of a breach.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Chrome.exe repeatedly modifying registry values (unusual for a browser), 2) PowerShell.exe creating files in user directories, 3) Process access events for critical system processes. While some events may be benign, the combination of these activities suggests potential system manipulation or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
