{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and process creation events. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a whoami.exe command, which is usually benign, just checks the current user. But then I see a cmd.exe command line that's trying to create a service called win32times with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a red flag. Creating a service with a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nNext, there's sc.exe being used to create the same service again, and then querying it. Also, multiple registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to persistence. The services.exe and svchost.exe entries are normal system processes, but the repeated registry changes might be part of an attack. \n\nLooking at the image loaded events, both Calculator.exe and svchost.exe loaded urlmon.dll. While urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, loading it from an unexpected context could be a sign of something. But in this case, the paths are standard system paths, so maybe not. \n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but the .new extension suggests it's a temporary file. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the key suspicious points are the attempts to create a service with a non-existent script, multiple registry modifications, and the use of cmd.exe and sc.exe in ways that could be part of an attack. These activities could be indicative of someone trying to set up persistence or execute scripts. However, some events are normal system behavior. The confidence isn't 100% because some events are benign, but the combination of the service creation and registry changes makes this batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of a service with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), repeated registry modifications, and PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage patterns consistent with potential persistence mechanisms or malicious payload execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look through each event. All the first seven events are about chrome.exe performing a registry value set under the RegistryEvent rule. That's a lot of the same event. Then there are two more events where chrome.exe loads images, specifically amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. The last event is about powershell.exe being accessed via ProcessAccess.\n\nHmm, registry changes by chrome.exe might be normal, but multiple instances could indicate something. However, the key points here are the image loads. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is related to Microsoft Defender's real-time protection. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading these DLLs, that's unusual because those DLLs are typically loaded by the antivirus services themselves. \n\nBut wait, maybe it's a false positive? Sometimes, processes can load DLLs from different locations. However, the paths here are standard system paths. Another thing to consider: if chrome.exe is loading these DLLs, it might be trying to bypass security features. For example, if a malicious actor is trying to disable or interfere with antivirus components, they might inject code into these DLLs. \n\nHowever, the events don't show any obvious malicious activity beyond the loading of these DLLs. There's no mention of unexpected network activity, file modifications, or other signs of compromise. The classification depends on whether loading these DLLs by chrome.exe is considered suspicious. \n\nIn a typical scenario, the ImageLoad events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe could be benign if the process is legitimate. But since these DLLs are critical for security, any process other than the antivirus service loading them might be a red flag. However, without additional context like the process's parent, command-line arguments, or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe batch has multiple registry events, but they're all the same. The two image loads are more concerning. The presence of powershell.exe being accessed might be normal, but combined with the other events, it might not be enough. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch might be interesting because of the unusual image loads by chrome.exe. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity beyond the loading of those DLLs. So, I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing registry modifications and loading security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) which could indicate evasion techniques or tampering with security features.
