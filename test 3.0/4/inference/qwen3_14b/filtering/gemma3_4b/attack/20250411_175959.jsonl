{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a Pipe Created event. Not immediately suspicious, but PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if it's part of a monitoring setup. But the file path is .yml.new, which could be a temporary file during configuration. Maybe not a big red flag yet.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe command line that includes several commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. That's a lot of commands that gather system information. This could be part of reconnaissance by an attacker trying to map the system's users and groups. The same command line appears again later, so that's a repeat. That seems suspicious.\n\nAnother entry shows powershell.exe with an Image loaded event pointing to MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it could be a sign of something. Then there's a net.exe user command, which is checking user accounts. Again, part of gathering information.\n\nThere's a process named net1.exe, which is similar to net.exe but with a typo. That might be a typo, but could also be a malicious executable trying to mimic a legitimate one. The command line is similar to net.exe, so maybe that's a red herring or a mistake in logging.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates a file named pacote_ativo.txt in the Downloads directory. Not sure what that file is, but creating a file in Downloads might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be relevant.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all about Registry value set events. Multiple entries here. If Chrome is modifying registry values a lot, that might be normal for updates or extensions, but if it's part of a larger attack, maybe not. However, there are so many entries here that it might just be normal activity.\n\nThen, another Image loaded event for urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer. Not sure if that's relevant. SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll, which is part of Windows. Maybe normal.\n\nThe updater.exe process creates a pipe, which might be normal for communication, but the command line is long and includes parameters related to crash reporting. That might be part of Google's updater, so maybe legitimate.\n\nThe cmdkey.exe \/list command is used to list stored credentials, which could be part of reconnaissance to find saved passwords. That's a bit concerning.\n\nLooking back at the PowerShell commands, they are using various commands to gather user and group information, which is typical in initial phases of an attack. The repetition of the same command line suggests that this might be a script being run multiple times. Also, the presence of cmdkey.exe \/list indicates trying to find stored credentials.\n\nThe entries with \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" in the winlog event task might be related to the PowerShell activities, indicating that the system's security groups and user accounts are being manipulated or examined. However, the processes are listed as None, which could be a logging error or indicate that the event is not tied to a specific process, making it harder to trace.\n\nPutting it all together, the suspicious elements are the repeated PowerShell commands gathering system information, the use of cmdkey.exe to list credentials, and the possible typo in net1.exe. These activities could be part of an attacker's reconnaissance phase. However, some of these might be normal system activities depending on the environment. But given the combination of multiple information-gathering commands and the potential for credential extraction, this seems like a valid reason to flag the batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several activities that warrant further investigation due to potential signs of reconnaissance or unauthorized system probing. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance:**\n   - Repeated use of PowerShell commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, and `dir C:\\Users` suggests **system enumeration**. These commands are commonly used to gather user\/group details, stored credentials, and file system information—hallmarks of an attacker mapping a target.\n\n2. **cmdkey.exe \/list:**\n   - The use of `cmdkey.exe \/list` indicates an attempt to **extract stored credentials** (e.g., saved passwords for network resources). This is a red flag, as it could signal an effort to compromise user accounts or access sensitive systems.\n\n3. **Unusual Process (net1.exe):**\n   - The presence of `net1.exe` (a typo or potential malicious variant of `net.exe`) executing a `user` command raises concerns. While `net.exe` is legitimate, the typo or unusual process name could indicate **malware masquerading as a system tool**.\n\n4. **File Creation in Downloads Directory:**\n   - The creation of `pacote_ativo.txt` in the Downloads folder could be benign, but combined with other activities, it might be part of **data exfiltration** or temporary storage for malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Winlog Events Related to User\/Group Management:**\n   - Multiple `Security Group Management` and `User Account Management` events (with `process: None`) may indicate **unauthorized changes to system permissions** or user accounts, though further context is needed to confirm.\n\n### **Legitimate Activities:**\n- **Winlogbeat and Google Updater:** These are legitimate tools for log shipping and crash reporting. The `.yml.new` file and `updater.exe` command line appear to be part of normal operations.\n- **Chrome Registry Modifications:** Frequent registry changes by Chrome could be due to updates or extensions, though excessive modifications might warrant scrutiny.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **mixed activity**, with some legitimate processes and others that could indicate **reconnaissance or credential harvesting**. The repeated PowerShell commands, use of `cmdkey.exe`, and unusual process names are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. Further investigation (e.g., checking file contents, user account changes, and network traffic) is recommended to confirm whether this is a legitimate system event or part of an attack. \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation**—the combination of system enumeration, credential extraction attempts, and anomalous processes suggests potential compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the entries here are about 'Security Group Management' tasks, which might be normal system activities. But then there are some other events that stand out. For example, there's an entry with SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those DLLs are part of Windows, but if a process is loading them, maybe that's not unusual. However, I should check if there's any pattern here.\n\nThen there's the net.exe and net1.exe processes running 'localgroup' commands. The 'net localgroup' command is used to manage user groups, which could be part of normal administration. But if this is done in a suspicious context, like adding unauthorized users, that's a problem. However, the logs here don't show the actual group changes, just the process creation.\n\nPowerShell.exe is involved in several events: creating files, accessing processes, and setting registry values. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Creating files in user directories might be normal, but combined with registry changes and process access, it could indicate something like a script being run. The fact that there's a file created named 'modulo_base.txt' might be benign, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. However, if the configuration is being modified in a way that's not authorized, that could be an issue. But again, the log doesn't show the content of the file, so it's unclear.\n\nLooking at the 'Registry value set' events from svchost.exe and conhost.exe. These processes are typically part of Windows services, but changing registry values could be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. However, without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to assess.\n\nThe MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is running with a command line that includes '\/installsource scheduler'. This might be part of a scheduled update, which is normal. But if the installer is being manipulated, that could be a concern.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a mix of normal system processes and some activities that could be part of legitimate operations. However, the repeated use of PowerShell for file creation and registry changes, along with the loading of certain DLLs, might indicate a potential security incident. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or known malware signatures, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe confidence here is moderate. The events aren't clearly malicious, but they do have elements that warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6. The justification is that while many events are normal, the combination of PowerShell activities and certain process behaviors could be indicative of something more.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating files and modifying registry values, combined with suspicious image loads (e.g., SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll) and potential group management activities, suggest possible malicious behavior requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
