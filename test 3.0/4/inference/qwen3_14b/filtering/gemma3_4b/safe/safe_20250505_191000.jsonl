So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of normal activity like Excel opening a CSV file, winlogbeat creating a file, and some standard system processes like svchost.exe and rundll32.exe. But then I notice SDXHelper.exe loading several DLLs from System32, like combase.dll, urlmon.dll, and others. Wait, those are legitimate system DLLs, so just loading them might not be a problem. But why is SDXHelper.exe doing this multiple times? Maybe it's a red flag if it's loading the same DLLs repeatedly, but sometimes that's just part of normal operations.\n\nThen there's the rundll32.exe command line that's launching shell32.dll with a specific GUID. That GUID might be something unusual. I should check if that's a known malicious GUID or if it's part of a legitimate process. Also, the command line includes -Embedding, which is sometimes used in malicious contexts to bypass security checks.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple entries for \"User Account Management\" with process null. That might indicate some account management activities, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, if there are no actual process names associated with those events, it might be a sign of something odd, like a failed process creation or a logon attempt that didn't attach a process.\n\nThe Excel process is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's Platform might be okay too. However, if Excel is loading unexpected DLLs, that could be a problem. But in this case, the DLLs listed are all standard ones.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is involved in a secured embedding, which might be part of legitimate WMI activities, but again, the command line could be suspicious if it's not standard.\n\nLooking at the confidence, there are some suspicious elements like the repeated ImageLoad events for SDXHelper.exe and the rundll32 command with a GUID. However, without more context or known bad indicators (like specific hashes or network activity), it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple User Account Management events without processes might also be a point of interest.\n\nBut overall, the logs don't show clear signs of malware or attacks. The suspicious elements are there but not conclusive. So maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because there are some anomalies that warrant further investigation, but not enough to confirm malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Image loaded' events for SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (e.g., combase.dll, urlmon.dll) may indicate legitimate behavior, but repeated loading of the same DLLs could suggest process injection or abnormal execution. Additionally, rundll32.exe executing with a GUID-based command line (-Embedding) raises suspicion, as this pattern is sometimes associated with malicious activity. The presence of multiple 'User Account Management' log entries without associated processes also warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are five events here. The first two are about files being created in the Recent folder under Microsoft Office, specifically a .LNK file named real_values.csv.LNK. The process involved is EXCEL.EXE. Then, the next three events are DNS queries initiated by EXCEL.EXE, but the file field is null here.\n\nHmm, creating a .LNK file in the Recent directory might be normal, but sometimes attackers use such files to maintain persistence or for other malicious purposes. However, just creating a shortcut isn't necessarily bad. The fact that it's happening twice might be a bit suspicious, but maybe it's just a user action.\n\nThen there are three DNS queries from Excel. That's unusual because Excel typically doesn't perform DNS lookups. Maybe the user is accessing a network resource, but three times in a row? That seems odd. Could be a sign of something like a malicious macro trying to communicate with a C2 server. But without more context, like the domains being queried, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of file creation and DNS queries from Excel might indicate a potential security issue. \n\nWait, but the user might be doing something legitimate. Maybe they're using Excel to access a shared network drive, which could cause DNS queries. But the fact that the same process is involved in both file creation and DNS queries could be a red flag. Also, the file path is in the AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent folder, which is where Windows stores recent files. A .LNK file here is a shortcut, so maybe the user is just saving a shortcut, but the repeated DNS queries are still concerning.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern here. The same process (Excel) creating a file and then making DNS queries. Maybe the DNS queries are part of a larger attack, like exfiltrating data or connecting to a malicious server. However, without more data points, like the actual DNS domains or other suspicious activities, it's a bit hard to be certain. \n\nBut the presence of both file creation and DNS queries from Excel could be interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence might be around 0.6 or 0.7. The justification would be the combination of unusual file creation and multiple DNS queries from Excel, which is not typical behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE combined with creation of a .LNK file in the Office Recent directory may indicate suspicious behavior, such as potential persistence mechanisms or network communication attempts by a malicious process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
