First, I'll scan through the events to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nI notice several entries related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. Not sure yet, but maybe part of normal operations.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks. The command line has \"calc.exe\" being run on logon and startup. That seems odd because calc.exe is just the calculator. But creating scheduled tasks with system permissions might be a red flag. Also, the command line has some weird names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" which might be obfuscated or part of a malicious payload.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. That's similar to the previous one. Then, there's a file created in the Tasks directory under System32, which is a common place for scheduled tasks. However, the names of the tasks are suspiciously named with numbers and underscores, which might be an attempt to hide their purpose.\n\nAlso, multiple svchost.exe processes are modifying registry values. While svchost is a normal host process, excessive registry changes could indicate something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting this together, the creation of scheduled tasks using calc.exe with system permissions and the unusual task names might indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code at startup or logon. This could be part of a persistence mechanism used by malware. The presence of multiple schtasks commands and the creation of task files in the System32 directory adds to the suspicion. However, there's no direct evidence of malware here, just suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon') using calc.exe as payload, which is unusual for legitimate system processes. 2) cmd.exe executing schtasks commands with system-level permissions. 3) Unusual registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanism attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Some of these are normal system processes, like svchost and chrome. But powershell.exe being used multiple times might be a red flag, especially if it's doing things like creating files or accessing processes.\n\nWait, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be normal if it's part of configuration. But I should check if that's expected. Also, there's a file created by powershell.exe called unidade_ativo.txt. That's a text file, maybe just a regular file, but depending on context, it could be something else.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events. Chrome.exe modifying the registry repeatedly could be normal if it's updating settings, but if it's doing so in a way that's unusual or in specific keys, that might be suspicious. Also, the Image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender components. Loading them might be normal, but if chrome is loading them, maybe there's an issue.\n\nAnother thing is the Process accessed events for powershell.exe. If a process is being accessed, that might indicate someone is trying to manipulate it. Also, the whoami.exe process is present, which just outputs user info. That's usually benign, but if it's being used in a script, maybe.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a lot of activity from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. The file creation by winlogbeat might be part of normal operations, but the repeated registry changes and process accesses could be signs of something. However, without more context, like specific registry keys modified or unusual file paths, it's hard to say. But the presence of multiple events that are typically not common for those processes (like chrome modifying registry values many times) might indicate a potential issue. However, since the justification needs to be concise, maybe the fact that there are multiple registry changes and file creations by processes that aren't typically involved in those actions could be a reason to flag it as interesting. But I should check if there's any clear malicious activity. Since there's no obvious malicious file paths or commands, but the volume of certain events might be suspicious. Alternatively, maybe it's just normal activity. The confidence might be around 0.6, as there are some suspicious points but not definitive evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with file creation events (e.g., unidade_ativo.txt) and process access attempts, suggest potential anomalous behavior that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
