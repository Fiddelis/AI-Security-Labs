{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. Wait, the command line shows DownloadFile with URLs from GitHub. GitHub is a common place for legitimate code, but sometimes attackers use it to host malicious scripts. However, just downloading a LICENSE.txt file might be benign, but the repetition here is a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, but then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of a script that's executing something temporarily, which is common in both legitimate and malicious activities. However, the fact that there are multiple such events might indicate automated or repeated actions.\n\nAlso, the command lines all involve downloading LICENSE.txt files from different GitHub repositories. The names of the repositories are a mix of seemingly innocuous terms like \"modulo_comum\" and \"componente_padrao,\" which might be Portuguese for \"common module\" or \"standard component.\" That could be part of a legitimate software distribution, but the pattern of multiple downloads from different repos might be suspicious. It could be that the attacker is using GitHub to host multiple payloads or scripts, which is a common technique.\n\nAnother point is the use of PowerShell with WebClient to download files. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, using it in this way without user interaction can be a sign of a malicious script. The fact that the files are being saved to the Temp directory and then deleted might be an attempt to avoid leaving traces, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of a legitimate software update or configuration process. But the combination of multiple downloads from GitHub, the use of PowerShell for network activity, and the temporary file creation\/deletion might indicate something more. The confidence here is a bit tricky. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a PowerShell command that uses WebClient's DownloadFile method to download a LICENSE.txt from a GitHub raw URL. The same pattern repeats in another event with a different GitHub URL. These URLs are from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is normal for downloading text files, but the fact that it's being done via PowerShell might be a red flag. However, sometimes developers do this for testing or automation.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to the creation of files. For example, a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt and another in the AppData directory. While file creation is normal, the combination with PowerShell downloads might indicate something. Also, there's a file creation related to winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe that's part of normal operations, but I need to check if there's anything unusual.\n\nThen, there are several registry value set events, mostly from chrome.exe and others. Chrome modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad, but repeated events could be a sign of something. However, the majority of these are from chrome.exe, which might be normal if the user is using extensions or updates.\n\nAnother point is the DNS query event. The process is listed as None, which might be an error or a system process. Not sure yet.\n\nThe presence of MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection is related to Windows Defender, so that's likely legitimate. However, if there were unexpected connections, that would be a concern.\n\nNow, looking at the PowerShell commands again. The DownloadFile method is used to fetch a LICENSE.txt from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the fact that these are being downloaded via PowerShell could be part of a script that's executing malicious code. However, the files are named LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign. But maybe the URLs are pointing to something else. Wait, the URLs in the examples are from repositories like \"objeto_padrao\/registro_comum\" and \"elemento_principal\/pacote_geral\". These names don't immediately ring a bell as malicious, but I should check if they're known repositories. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple PowerShell processes with different tasks: Pipe Created, File created, Registry value set, etc. The combination of these events might indicate that a script is being executed that's interacting with the file system and registry. But again, without seeing the actual content of the downloaded files, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple file creations in the Downloads folder and AppData might be normal, but if they're being created by PowerShell scripts that were downloaded, that's a potential risk. Also, the winlogbeat file creation is part of configuration, but if it's being modified unexpectedly, that could be an issue.\n\nHowever, I don't see any obvious signs of malware, like unusual network connections to known bad IPs, execution of suspicious binaries, or encryption activities. The events are mostly about file operations and registry changes, which can be part of legitimate processes.\n\nBut wait, the use of PowerShell for downloading files from GitHub might be a red flag. Typically, downloading files via PowerShell isn't inherently malicious, but in some contexts, it could be part of a larger attack. For example, if the downloaded file is a script that's then executed, but I don't see any events indicating execution of those files. The events only show the download and file creation, not execution.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be doing some legitimate automation, but the repetition of similar events could be a sign of something. However, without more data, it's hard to confirm. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub might be part of a script that's being run as part of a development or testing environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the events aren't clearly malicious, the repeated use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub and the associated file creations could be worth investigating further. It's not a clear-cut case of malware, but it's suspicious enough that an investigation might be warranted to ensure that these activities are legitimate and not part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns:**\n1. **PowerShell Downloads from GitHub:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `WebClient.DownloadFile` to fetch `LICENSE.txt` files from **raw.githubusercontent.com**. While GitHub is legitimate, this method is often abused in **malicious scripts** to execute arbitrary code or download payloads. \n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $wc.DownloadFile(\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_padrao\/registro_comum\/LICENSE.txt\", \"C:\\temp\\file.txt\")\n     ```\n   - **Risk:** The use of `DownloadFile` in PowerShell is a **common indicator of compromise (IoC)** for malware or phishing attempts, especially if the downloaded files are not properly validated.\n\n2. **File Creation in User Directories:**\n   - Files are created in **`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`** and **`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData`**, which could indicate **unauthorized script execution** or **data exfiltration**. The presence of files like `entrada_base.txt` and `elemento_padrao.txt` raises questions about their purpose.\n   - **Risk:** These files might be **staging areas for malicious payloads** or logs of user activity.\n\n3. **Repetitive Registry Modifications:**\n   - **`chrome.exe`** and **`powershell.exe`** frequently modify the registry. While this can be normal, repeated changes might indicate **registry-based persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries or modifying system settings).\n   - **Risk:** Could be an attempt to **persist malware** or alter system behavior.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - The **`winlogbeat.yml.new`** file is created multiple times in the **`winlogbeat`** directory. This might be part of **legitimate configuration updates**, but if the file is being overwritten or modified by an external process, it could indicate **tampering**.\n   - **Risk:** Potential **log tampering** or **misconfiguration** if the file is not properly secured.\n\n5. **Network Connection by Antivirus Service:**\n   - **`MpDefenderCoreService.exe`** (Windows Defender) has a network connection. While normal, this could be a **red herring** if the service is being **spoofed** or **compromised**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **PowerShell script execution** via `DownloadFile` from GitHub.\n- **Unusual file creation** in user directories without user interaction.\n- **Repeated registry modifications** by non-system processes.\n- **Multiple writes** to the same file (`winlogbeat.yml.new`), which might indicate **tampering**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the downloaded files** (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`, `entrada_base.txt`) for malicious content (e.g., embedded scripts, obfuscated code).\n2. **Check for unauthorized user activity** (e.g., login logs, process execution history).\n3. **Validate the integrity of the `winlogbeat.yml.new` file** and ensure it matches expected configurations.\n4. **Monitor for additional PowerShell activity** (e.g., use of `Invoke-Expression`, `IEX`, or `Start-Process`).\n5. **Scan the system** for malware using updated antivirus tools and endpoint detection systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events alone do not confirm a breach, the combination of **PowerShell-based downloads**, **suspicious file creation**, and **registry modifications** is **highly indicative of a potential security incident**. Immediate investigation is recommended to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries involving 'svchost.exe' and 'powershell.exe' with registry value sets. That's common in some attacks, but not always malicious. Then there's 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll' from System32. Wait, that's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a 'cmd.exe' running a command to delete a scheduled task named 'spawn' and another using 'REG DELETE' on the Run key. That seems suspicious because deleting a task might be part of cleaning up after an attack. Also, there's 'schtasks.exe' being used to delete a task, which could be part of removing persistence. The repeated use of 'powershell.exe' with 'Process accessed' might indicate someone trying to execute commands or scripts. The 'whoami.exe' commands are usually benign, just checking user context. But the combination of deleting registry entries, scheduled tasks, and multiple process accesses could be signs of an attacker trying to remove traces or modify system settings. However, without more context like unusual network activity or unexpected file modifications, it's a bit ambiguous.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries with \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" tasks. But what stands out are the \"Image loaded\" events. Let me check those. \n\nLooking at the files loaded, there's mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to the .NET Framework. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. However, there's also a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Then, it's immediately deleted. That's a red flag. Creating and deleting a file so quickly could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks with PowerShell. While some of these might be normal, the frequency and combination with file creation and deletion might indicate something malicious. Also, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded could be part of legitimate antivirus activity, but combined with the other events, it's worth checking.\n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat.exe process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of normal monitoring. But the temporary file creation and deletion by PowerShell seems suspicious. \n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern of multiple events from the same process. The PowerShell process is involved in several actions, including accessing processes, modifying the registry, loading images, and creating\/deleting files. The combination of these actions might indicate an attempt to execute a script, modify system settings, and then remove evidence.\n\nBut wait, the Temp file is created and then deleted. That's a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving evidence. Even though the file is deleted, the creation event is logged, which is a clue. Also, the use of PowerShell with the & {} syntax might be part of obfuscation techniques.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of a legitimate script execution, like a user running a PowerShell script that temporarily writes a file. But the fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly, along with multiple registry and process access events, raises suspicion. \n\nConsidering all these points, the batch might be interesting enough for further investigation because of the suspicious file creation and deletion, combined with multiple PowerShell-related events.

Not too suspicious. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed and some registry changes. PowerShell is common, but frequent access and registry modifications could be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating processes, accessing the registry, and loading image files. The command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\" seem odd. That syntax might be a way to bypass certain security checks or execute commands without proper logging. \n\nThen there are entries about image loading, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, so they're normal. But the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might indicate that the system is trying to block something. \n\nA file is created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute code temporarily without leaving traces. The file name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to PowerShell script execution, possibly indicating a script that's been allowed to run despite policy restrictions.\n\nThere's also the ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry. Not sure about that one, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it adds to the suspicion. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes, registry changes, temporary file creation and deletion, and possibly bypassing execution policies.

That's unusual because Calculator is a normal app, but changing registry values might be suspicious. But maybe it's just a normal action. Then there's powershell.exe with pipe created, registry changes, process accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe doing registry value sets. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that's odd. Then there's a command line for powershell.exe with & {} which seems empty, maybe a placeholder or a mistake. The engine lifecycle task might be part of a security product, but not sure yet.\n\nThen, there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably not malicious. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData directory. That could be benign, but sometimes attackers use such locations to hide files.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is normal, just displaying user info. However, the next event is a process create for powershell.exe with a command to remove a file named objeto_principal.zip from the temp directory. Removing a file might be part of cleanup after an attack. \n\nThen, multiple image loads for .NET framework DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell scripts, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate something. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes by Chrome and PowerShell, file creation in AppData, and attempts to remove a zip file. The presence of several registry modifications and file operations by what should be normal processes might indicate malicious activity. However, some events are normal (like Defender's MpClient.dll). But the combination of these events, especially the removal of a file and multiple registry changes, could be signs of an attack.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory, which seems legitimate. Then, a file is created in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Shortly after, that same file is deleted. That could be part of normal operations, but creating and deleting a script might be a red flag if it's part of an attack.\n\nNext, there are several events where PowerShell is used to remove various .zip and .txt files from the Temp directory. The command lines use Remove-Item with ErrorAction Ignore, which might be trying to clean up after some activity. However, repeatedly deleting files could be part of an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be related to PowerShell's own processes. But the key thing here is the pattern of file creation and deletion in the Temp folder. The presence of multiple Remove-Item commands targeting different files might indicate that someone is trying to execute scripts and then delete them to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there's a 'File created' event for a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. That could be related to PowerShell profiles being modified, which might be a way to persist access or execute commands automatically.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these activities are normal. Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is a legitimate file, so loading that isn't suspicious. The deletion of temporary files is common, but the frequency and the specific commands used (like -ErrorAction Ignore) might be more concerning. Also, the fact that multiple files are being deleted across different events could be part of a larger operation.\n\nAnother point is the use of PowerShell for these operations. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in scripting and automation can be abused for malicious purposes. The combination of creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, along with the use of Remove-Item commands, might suggest an attempt to execute scripts and then remove them, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The logs don't show any unauthorized access, exploitation, or data exfiltration. The events are all related to file operations and process activities that could be part of normal user behavior or legitimate scripts.

Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in the Temp folder, followed by multiple `Remove-Item` commands targeting `.zip`, `.txt`, and other files in the same directory. This pattern (create → delete) is common in **malware execution and cleanup**, as attackers often delete evidence after running payloads.\n\n2. **Frequent Use of `Remove-Item` with `-ErrorAction Ignore`:**\n   - The use of `-ErrorAction Ignore` suggests an attempt to suppress errors during deletion, which may indicate **intentional cleanup of temporary files** or **scripts** to avoid detection.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - PowerShell is used extensively for file operations and registry modifications. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in this context (especially with obfuscation or cleanup) could signal **malicious scripting** or **post-exploitation activities**.\n\n4. **No Direct Malware Indicators:**\n   - No obvious malware hashes, network exfiltration, or unauthorized access are present. The activities are confined to file system operations.\n\n### **Legitimate Context:**\n- **Windows Defender\/MpOAV.dll**: Loading legitimate system files (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`) is normal.\n- **User-Initiated Actions**: Temporary file creation\/deletion could stem from legitimate user workflows (e.g., scripts, updates, or application usage).\n\n### **Suspicion Level:**\n- **Moderate Suspicion**: The pattern of file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory, coupled with PowerShell's use, is **consistent with post-exploitation behavior** (e.g., executing payloads and cleaning logs). However, **no definitive malicious activity** (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration) is evident.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Correlate with Additional Data**: Investigate if these activities align with known user behavior or if they occur alongside other suspicious events (e.g., unusual network traffic, privilege escalation).\n- **Check PowerShell Logs**: Review PowerShell transcripts or event logs for obfuscated commands or unexpected script execution.\n- **Monitor Temp Directory**: Implement monitoring for unexpected file creation\/deletion in sensitive directories.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**INTERESTING** – The logs warrant further investigation due to the suspicious pattern of file operations and PowerShell usage, but no conclusive evidence of malicious activity is present."}

While these are legitimate components of Windows Defender, their loading in conjunction with PowerShell scripts could indicate **interaction with antivirus processes** (e.g., bypassing detection).\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving PowerShell and `conhost.exe`. Registry changes are common in legitimate scenarios but may be exploited for persistence or configuration changes.\n\n4. **Process Access:**\n   - `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggest **monitoring or interaction with processes**, which could be benign (e.g., debugging) or part of **malicious process injection**.\n\n5. **Whoami.exe:**\n   - The use of `whoami.exe` is standard for checking user context but may be part of **privilege escalation attempts** if combined with other suspicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Cleanup Behavior:** The pattern of creating and deleting files in `%TEMP%` could be part of **malware cleanup** or **log erasure**.\n- **Unusual DLL Load Paths:** Loading Defender DLLs in non-standard contexts (e.g., via PowerShell) may indicate **tampering with security tools**.\n- **Repetitive Commands:** The repeated use of `Remove-Item` across different files suggests **automated scripts**, which may be benign (e.g., deployment tools) but could also be **malicious**.\n\n---\n\n### **Classification:**\n- **Interesting for Investigation:** The logs show **normal system activity** (e.g., PowerShell use, file management) but also **patterns consistent with adversarial behavior** (e.g., cleanup, registry changes). \n- **No Clear IOC (Indicators of Compromise):** No direct evidence of malware, exfiltration, or unauthorized access is present. However, the **combination of actions** raises **low-to-moderate risk**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Correlate with Additional Data:** Check for:\n  - Network traffic (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs).\n  - User behavior (e.g., elevated privileges, unusual login times).\n  - File hashes of created\/deleted files (if available).\n- **Monitor PowerShell Scripts:** Review logs for PowerShell script execution (e.g., via `Invoke-Expression`, `IEX`) or use of `Invoke-Item`.\n- **Check Defender Logs:** Investigate Windows Defender events for anomalies (e.g., blocked processes, false positives).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **not definitively malicious** but exhibit **behavior warranting further scrutiny**.

That's normal for some operations, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami.exe is typically used to get the current user's identity, which isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with other actions, it might be a red flag. \n\nWait, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. The command line is the same each time, which could be normal if it's part of a legitimate process. However, the repeated execution might be worth checking. \n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. Accessing a process can be normal, but if it's being accessed by other processes, that might be a sign of something. But in these logs, it's just the task 'Process accessed' without more context.\n\nThe interesting part is the last two entries. The first one is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the second entry is powershell.exe creating a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in the same Downloads folder. \n\nNow, 'pacote_ativo.txt' sounds like a text file, maybe a script or a log. But why would powershell.exe create that? If this is part of a normal user activity, it's not a problem. However, if there's no prior context of this file being created by the user, it might be suspicious. \n\nBut wait, the user is fiddelis, and the files are in their Downloads directory. Maybe they downloaded something. However, the presence of multiple whoami.exe and powershell.exe events could indicate that someone is trying to gather information or execute commands. \n\nBut the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like downloading malware, executing suspicious scripts, or accessing sensitive files. The events are mostly about process creation and file access, which are common in normal operations. \n\nHowever, the combination of multiple process accesses, whoami.exe executions, and file creation by powershell.exe might be part of a larger pattern. But without more context, like network activity or other suspicious processes, it's hard to say. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. The events alone aren't clearly malicious, but they do show some activity that could be part of an investigation. So, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. The justification is that there's repeated process access and file creation, which could indicate benign activity but might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process access events for powershell.exe and whoami.exe, combined with file creation by powershell.exe in the user's Downloads directory, suggest potential benign or investigative activity that may require further analysis.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
