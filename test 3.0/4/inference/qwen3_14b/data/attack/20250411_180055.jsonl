{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is being accessed, creating processes, and loading images. Some of the image paths point to .NET DLLs, which is normal, but there's also a mention of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, but maybe it's being used in a way that's suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances of Compress-Archive commands. These are creating zip files in the Temp directory. While compressing files isn't inherently malicious, doing this multiple times in quick succession might indicate something. Also, the paths being compressed are a bit generic, with terms like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"objeto_principal,\" which could be obfuscated paths. \n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common in some malicious activities to avoid leaving traces. The fact that the file is created and deleted quickly might be a red flag.\n\nThe events include ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, and ImageLoad. The repeated use of PowerShell and the multiple Compress-Archive commands could be part of a larger operation, like exfiltrating data or preparing for a payload. However, without more context, like network activity or other suspicious processes, it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe presence of the Windows Defender DLL might be a false positive, but combined with the other events, it's worth looking into. The classification here is probably \"INTERESTING\" because of the unusual volume of PowerShell activities and the suspicious file operations. The confidence is around 0.75 since there are indicators but not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing compress-archive commands with obfuscated paths, combined with frequent process access and image load events, suggest potential data exfiltration or malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, the file path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. That's a legitimate Defender DLL. Maybe a false positive? But maybe the fact that it's being loaded by PowerShell could be something. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are several entries where PowerShell is running Compress-Archive commands. The command lines are similar, compressing directories into temporary ZIP files. The paths being compressed are all under various directories like \"elemento_secundario\" or \"componente_principal\". These might be benign, but the repetition and the use of $env:TEMP could be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to obfuscate the files they're compressing.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module, which is a legitimate module. But the fact that it's being used multiple times in a short period might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so this might just be normal activity. But the same event repeats twice, which is odd. Maybe a typo or a duplicate entry.\n\nSeveral registry events are logged, with processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, etc., setting registry values. Registry changes can be normal, but if done by unexpected processes, they might be a concern. However, the processes listed here are common ones, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's also an event where calc.exe (Calculator) loads urlmon.dll. That's a standard system DLL, so probably nothing wrong there. Same with Calculator.exe accessing the registry. These are likely normal operations.\n\nNow, considering the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell instances running archive commands, creating temporary files, and some registry changes. But none of the events seem to point to obvious malicious activity like downloading files, executing scripts, or connecting to external IPs. The repetition of Compress-Archive might be part of a legitimate process, like preparing files for transfer or backup.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands in a short time could be indicative of someone trying to manipulate files or exfiltrate data. But without more context, like network activity or unexpected file destinations, it's hard to confirm. The fact that the user is using temporary files might be a way to avoid leaving traces, but again, that's common in both benign and malicious scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are a few suspicious patterns, such as the repeated use of PowerShell for compressing files and the registry changes, there's not enough evidence to definitively label this as malicious. It might be worth further investigation, but based on the provided logs, it's not clearly a security threat. So, the batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's additional context not provided here.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of Log Entries:**\n\n1. **Legitimate Activity:**\n   - **Windows Defender DLL Load:** The first event involves `powershell.exe` loading `MpClient.dll` from the legitimate Windows Defender path. This is a normal system operation and not inherently suspicious.\n   - **Standard System DLLs:** Events involving `urlmon.dll` loaded by `calc.exe` or `Calculator.exe` are routine and unrelated to malicious behavior.\n\n2. **PowerShell Archive Commands:**\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing `Compress-Archive` commands to compress directories (e.g., `elemento_secundario`, `componente_principal`) into temporary ZIP files (`$env:TEMP`). \n   - **Potential Concern:** While compression itself is benign, the repetitive use of this command in a short time frame could indicate obfuscation or preparation for data exfiltration. However, without context (e.g., destination of ZIP files, network activity), this remains ambiguous.\n\n3. **Registry Changes:**\n   - Several processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`) trigger \"Registry value set\" events. These are common during normal system operations or software updates. No clear malicious intent is evident here.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - The repeated logging of `winlogbeat.exe` creating `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in the `Downloads` directory suggests a possible duplicate entry or misconfiguration. Winlogbeat itself is a legitimate tool, so this is unlikely to be malicious.\n\n5. **Other Processes:**\n   - Events involving `calc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` are standard system processes and not indicative of threats.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe log entries contain **no clear evidence of malicious activity**. While the repetitive use of `Compress-Archive` in PowerShell might warrant further investigation, it is not definitively suspicious without additional context (e.g., network exfiltration, unauthorized file access). The majority of events align with normal system behavior or legitimate tool usage (e.g., Winlogbeat, Windows Defender). \n\n**Final Determination:**  \n**Not interesting for investigation** based on the provided logs. No actionable threats or anomalies are identified."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. Most of the entries are about chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of themâ€”like seven entries. But registry changes by Chrome might be normal, especially if it's updating settings or extensions. However, repeated registry modifications could be a red flag if they're part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nThen there are two image loaded events. One is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading this DLL might be normal, but if it's being loaded by Chrome, that's unusual. The other is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is also a legitimate file. But again, Chrome loading these might be suspicious.\n\nNext, there's an event about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file could be part of its normal operation. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which might be less secure. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nThen there are two ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, just accessing a process isn't necessarily bad. The whoami.exe process is a standard tool for checking user context, so that's probably benign.\n\nPutting it all together: Chrome making multiple registry changes and loading Defender DLLs could be part of a larger attack. Maybe the attacker is trying to modify Chrome's behavior or bypass security features. However, the events don't show clear signs of exploitation or data exfiltration. The presence of legitimate processes like winlogbeat and whoami might be normal. But the combination of Chrome's activities with those DLLs might be suspicious. I'm not 100% sure, but there's enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing registry modifications and loading Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) may indicate attempts to manipulate security mechanisms. While some activity (e.g., whoami.exe, winlogbeat.exe) appears benign, the combination of Chrome-related registry changes and unexpected DLL loading warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
