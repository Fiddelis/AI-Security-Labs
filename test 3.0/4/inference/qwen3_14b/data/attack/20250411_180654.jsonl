{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a temporary file, maybe normal, but created by PowerShell. Not immediately suspicious, but could be part of something.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets by chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry multiple times might be normal, but repeated events could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, looking further down, there's a process with command_line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds like it's capturing keystrokes, which is a red flag. Malware often uses such scripts to log keystrokes for stealing information.\n\nAlso, multiple instances of powershell.exe loading various .dll files from system directories. While some are legitimate, the combination with the keystroke logging script might indicate a malicious payload. The repeated registry accesses and image loads could be part of establishing persistence or executing malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the multiple entries of the same command_line pattern with different paths. This could be an attempt to evade detection by varying the paths but using the same malicious script. The use of $env:TEMP suggests temporary storage, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other benign activities. The whoami.exe process is normal, just checking user identity. The chrome.exe events might be part of normal operations, but the frequency and combination with PowerShell activities make me think there's something wrong.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, multiple image loads from system directories, and repeated PowerShell activities pointing to keystroke logging are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Even though some events are normal, the combination here is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in temporary directories, combined with frequent registry modifications and image loads of .NET DLLs, suggests potential keystroke logging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs step by step. First, I'll look for any suspicious patterns or repeated activities. \n\nI notice multiple entries involving PowerShell executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines show these scripts are being run with a -LogPath parameter pointing to the TEMP directory, specifically key.log. The fact that the same script is being executed from different paths (like C:\\modulo_padrao, C:\\elemento_base, etc.) might indicate that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the source or is using multiple copies of the same malicious script.\n\nNext, there are several file creation and deletion events related to temporary files. For example, a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest... and then immediately deleted. This could be part of a technique to execute scripts without leaving long-term evidence, which is common in malware.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory might be normal if it's part of a legitimate monitoring setup, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the key suspicious points are the repeated PowerShell executions of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious script used to capture keystrokes, indicating potential data exfiltration or keylogging activity.\n\nAlso, the task 'Execute a Remote Command' with a file path that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests that there's a remote command being executed, which could be part of a larger attack chain. \n\nHowever, some of the other events, like the image loaded events for Windows Defender DLLs, might be normal system activities. But combined with the PowerShell scripts and the file operations, the overall pattern leans towards malicious behavior. \n\nI should check if the same user (fiddelis) is involved in multiple actions, which could indicate a compromised account. Also, the use of temporary directories for logging keystrokes is a red flag. \n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows a pattern of executing keystroke logging scripts multiple times, creating and deleting temporary files, and executing remote commands, which is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with -LogPath parameter, indicating potential keystroke logging.
