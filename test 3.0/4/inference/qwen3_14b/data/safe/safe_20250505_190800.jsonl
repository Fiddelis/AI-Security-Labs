{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these logs together and determine if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell. There are multiple instances of PowerShell processes creating files, loading images, and even deleting files. For example, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1, and then it's deleted. That might be a red flag because creating and deleting temporary files could be part of an attack, like executing malicious scripts and then cleaning up traces.\n\nAlso, there's a PowerShell process running with the command line \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\teste.ps1\". Bypassing the execution policy is often a sign of someone trying to run scripts that would normally be blocked. The file teste.ps1 is in the Downloads folder, which isn't unusual, but combined with the bypass, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell. While that might just be normal operation, if there are many of them, it could indicate something unusual. Also, the loading of various DLLs like clr.dll and MpOAV.dll. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender, so maybe that's normal, but it's worth checking if there are any unexpected loads.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. However, if this is part of a larger pattern of unusual activity, it could be a concern.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there's mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE setting registry values. mmc.exe is the Microsoft Management Console, which is normal, but if it's doing something unusual, that could be a problem. Explorer.EXE modifying the registry might also be benign, but again, depends on the context.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the PowerShell activity with bypassed execution policies, creation and deletion of temporary scripts, and multiple image loads. These could indicate an attempt to execute a script that's been bypassing security policies, which is a common tactic in attacks. However, without more context, like the actual content of the scripts or more anomalous behavior, it's a bit tricky. But considering the combination of these events, it's leaning towards being interesting because the suspicious PowerShell activities are notable and could be part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including bypassing execution policies, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, and loading potentially malicious DLLs. These activities combined with repeated file creation events may indicate an attempted attack or script-based exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell.exe is accessing a process, which is normal. Then, there are several ImageLoad events. The files loaded here are all legitimate Microsoft .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard components, so loading them isn't suspicious on its own. But then there's an entry for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus software, so that's also normal.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That seems like a test script, maybe related to PowerShell execution policy checks. Then, the same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a temporary file could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use temporary files to execute malicious scripts. However, the filename here includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which sounds like a legitimate test by the system or a user.\n\nAnother FileCreate event points to a StartupProfileData file. That's related to PowerShell's startup profiles, which might be part of configuring the environment. The Registry value set event is also common during configuration changes.\n\nThe last event is about executing a remote command, but the process is null here. That might be a log entry from another source, but without a process name, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's a system event or a misfire in logging.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events involve PowerShell loading legitimate system DLLs and handling temporary files. The presence of Windows Defender's DLL and the temporary script file might be part of normal operations, like testing execution policies or configuring PowerShell. However, the combination of creating a temporary script and then deleting it could be a red flag if it's part of a larger pattern. But in this batch, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, connecting to suspicious IPs, or executing unknown scripts. The events are all within the realm of normal system operations and configuration changes. So, while some events are noteworthy, the overall batch doesn't show signs of a security incident. Therefore, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, as there's no clear malicious activity detected here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show PowerShell loading legitimate system DLLs (e.g., .NET components, Windows Defender) and handling temporary files, which align with normal operations. No suspicious payloads, network activity, or anomalous behavior is detected in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
