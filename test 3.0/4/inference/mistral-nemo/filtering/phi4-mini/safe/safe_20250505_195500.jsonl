However, without additional context or further logs, it's challenging to determine if this activity is normal or indicative of a potential security threat."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, here's what's happening:\n\n1. The process `SDXHelper.exe` is creating new files in rapid succession.\n2. All these files are located in the same directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c3475b0a986e7d1\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n3. The filenames all start with `officeaicopilot-strings.min_` followed by a unique hash.\n4. The files are being created with the rule `File created (rule: FileCreate)`. This suggests that these files might be temporary or cache files used by Microsoft Office for some functionality.\n\nHere's an example of how one of these logs looks like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"SDXHelper.exe\"\n  },\n  \"activity\": {\n    \"type\": \"File created\",\n    \"rule\": \"FileCreate\"\n  },\n  \"file\": {\n    \"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\8c3475b0a986e7d1\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_123456789abcdef0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you're concerned about the number of files being created or their size, you might want to monitor disk space usage over time. If the disk space starts running low, that could be a sign that these files are not being deleted properly.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say for certain what these files are for or whether they're causing any issues. It could be normal behavior for Microsoft Office, so it might be best to reach out to Microsoft support if you have further questions about this activity."}

This could be causing an issue. Check if these files are indeed different or if there's a mistake in the hashing process.\n\n3. **Antivirus Software**: Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with file creation processes. Temporarily disabling your antivirus might help you determine if it's causing the issue.\n\n4. **Corrupted Installation\/Update**: If this issue started happening after a specific update or change in your system, consider reverting that change or performing a clean re-install of the problematic software.\n\n5. **Check Event Viewer**: For more detailed logs about what might be going wrong, check the Windows Event Viewer (Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application).\n\n6. **Contact Software Vendor\/Support**: If this issue is specific to a certain software, consider reaching out to their support or developer community for further assistance."}

However, the specific values and keys aren't provided due to the log format (`\"file\":null`).\n\n3. **Image Load Events**:\n   - `urlmon.dll` is loaded by `chrome.exe`.\n   - `MpClient.dll` is also loaded by `chrome.exe`.\n\n4. **Unknown Process** (not specified in logs):\n   - A process with an unknown name (`chrome.exe` or any other) sets a registry value, but the specific details aren't provided.\n\nThese events suggest that Chrome might be updating some of its components or settings, while SDXHelper is creating or manipulating some files related to Office's offline files for AI copilot. The repeated file creation events and unknown process logs could indicate potential issues or errors, but without more context, it's difficult to determine if these are normal operations or signs of malicious activity.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check the integrity of the created `.js` files.\n- Monitor Chrome's behavior for any unusual activities.\n- Review system logs for any related errors or warnings.\n- If possible, compare these events with a known clean baseline to identify anomalies."}
