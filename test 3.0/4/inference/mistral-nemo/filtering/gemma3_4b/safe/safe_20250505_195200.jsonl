The filenames follow a pattern of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\".\n\nHere's an example of how one of these files would look like:\n```\nC:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\n```\n\nThe `<hash>` part in the filename is a unique identifier, likely a hash of some sort, that changes with each file creation.\n\n4. **Possible Reason**: Given the context (Office and AI), these files might be related to Office's AI-driven features or updates, such as the Microsoft 365 Copilot (previously known as \"Copilot\"). However, without more information about the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process and its functionality, this is purely speculative."}

This is likely a part of Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **Event Type**: The task performed by this process in all these events is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".\n\n3. **File Details**: The files created have the following pattern:\n   - They are all located in the same directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`\n   - They are all named \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a unique hash.\n   - These files are likely JavaScript or JSON format, as they have the \".min\" suffix which is common for minified JavaScript files.\n\n4. **Timestamps**: The logs don't show timestamps, so we can't determine when these files were created or if there's a pattern to their creation times.\n\n5. **Frequency**: Without timestamps, it's hard to tell how often these files are being created. However, the repetition of hashes suggests that these files might be getting recreated frequently.\n\n6. **Potential Issue**: While it's not uncommon for software to create and manage temporary or cache files, the frequency and apparent recreation of these files could potentially indicate an issue. It might be worth looking into if there are any performance issues or errors related to these files."}

It might be worth checking if any recent updates or installations have coincided with this behavior starting.\n\nTo troubleshoot, you could:\n\n- Monitor the SDXHelper.exe process in Task Manager or using a tool like Process Explorer to see if there are any unusual patterns.\n- Check your antivirus software settings and temporary file locations.\n- Review any recent software changes that might coincide with this behavior.\n- Consider running a system check or malware scan if you suspect a more malicious cause."}
