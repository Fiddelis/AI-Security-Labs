They follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_<hash>.js\".\n\n3. **Process Involved**: All these file creation events are associated with the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". This could be a custom process or part of an Office-related service, but without more context, it's difficult to say for certain.\n\n4. **Possible Issue**: It seems like either the process is not handling file locking\/access properly (leading to these repeated creation attempts), or there might be some sort of infinite loop or error in the script that causes these files to keep being recreated.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you could:\n\n- Check if the files are indeed necessary and if they're causing any issues (like bloat or performance degradation).\n- Inspect the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process to understand its function better.\n- Review the scripts or code related to these file creations to see if there's an infinite loop or error that needs fixing.\n- Monitor these events over time to see if they eventually stabilize, worsen, or resolve on their own."}

However, without more specific information about what changes were made around this time or other logs indicating the reason for these files' creation, it's difficult to pinpoint their exact purpose.\n\nIf you're concerned about these files or the activity they represent, I would recommend reaching out to Microsoft Support or monitoring these changes further to ensure they are safe and necessary."}

These files are being created in the folder:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n     ```\n   - One instance of `SDXHelper.exe` is creating multiple files with the same name (e.g., `excel-copilot-strings_34914bd0983d608e4e1d45ac13c214ba.js`). This could indicate a bug in the software, or it might be normal behavior depending on the context.\n   - Another instance of `SDXHelper.exe` is creating a different file named `vendors~code-preview-dialog_d618907e43f5e2addf334598f88346d9.js`.
