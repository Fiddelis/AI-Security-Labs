Each event represents a single occurrence of a specific type, such as a process creation, file creation, registry value modification, or user account management.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the types of events and their corresponding meanings:\n\n1. `Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)`: A new process has been created.\n2. `File created (rule: FileCreate)`: A new file has been created.\n3. `Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)`: An executable file or library has been loaded into memory.\n4. `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`: A registry value has been modified.\n5. `User Account Management`: User account management activities, such as login or logout events.\n\nSome observations from the log:\n\n* There are multiple instances of processes like `chrome.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` being loaded into memory.\n* The `winlogbeat.exe` process is creating files in the `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new` directory.\n* There are multiple instances of user account management events, which might indicate login or logout attempts.\n* Some processes, like `SDXHelper.exe`, load libraries from the `C:\\Windows\\System32` directory.\n\nThese observations may provide insights into system activity and potential security threats."}
