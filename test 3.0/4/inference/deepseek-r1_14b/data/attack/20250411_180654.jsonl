{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are from Chrome and PowerShell. The Chrome events show multiple registry writes. Registry changes can be normal but also suspicious depending on what's being changed. However, seeing a lot of these might indicate something is trying to modify system settings repeatedly, which could be malicious.\n\nThen there are several instances where powershell.exe is running scripts. Notably, the command lines in some events show paths like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This script name sounds like it's meant to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic for keyloggers used by malware. The fact that it's being called multiple times with different paths but the same functionality raises red flags.\n\nLooking at other PowerShell activities: accessing files, loading images (like mscoree.dll and others). While some of these are normal for PowerShell execution, the repeated calls to external scripts and the specific script name suggest potentially malicious behavior. Also, there's a process creation event for whoami.exe, which is usually benign but sometimes used by attackers to check user privileges.\n\nConsidering all together: multiple registry writes from Chrome (could be legitimate updates or persistence mechanisms), repeated PowerShell executions with keylogging scripts, and unusual file accesses. These patterns collectively indicate possible malicious activity. The confidence is high because the combination of events points towards potential attack indicators like persistence scripts and data exfiltration via keystrokes.\n\nSo, the batch should be classified as INTERESTING due to signs of suspicious script execution and possible unauthorized access or data collection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), registry modifications, and file accesses suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers to execute malicious commands. The command lines show paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which suggests scripts designed to capture keystrokes or log activities on the system. That's a red flag because such scripts could be used for keylogging, a common tactic in malware.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several events where powershell.exe is creating temporary files, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1. Temporary files created by PowerShell scripts can indicate malicious activities trying to evade detection or persist on the system. The repeated creation and deletion of these files could be part of an attempt to disguise malicious actions as normal script testing.\n\nAnother point is the use of different command lines with varying paths, such as modulo_padrao, elemento_base, etc. This variation might be an effort to obfuscate where the scripts are coming from or to spread out the indicators across multiple directories. Such behavior is often seen in more sophisticated attacks to avoid detection by simple file checks.\n\nThere's also a mention of Remote Command execution in one event, which could indicate that powershell.exe is being used to run commands on behalf of another process or over a network, adding another layer of potential malicious activity.\n\nWhile some entries like the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new seem benign and related to log management tools, the overwhelming number of PowerShell events with suspicious scripts and file operations stands out. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could signal an ongoing attack or exfiltration attempt.\n\nIn summary, the combination of numerous PowerShell executions, temporary file creations, keylogging script references, and remote command execution points towards potential malicious activity. This batch is definitely worth investigating to ensure there's no active compromise or data being stolen.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with potentially malicious intent, including keylogging and file creation\/deletion activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
