Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that makes a lot of network requests. So nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being run a few times. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The first event shows 'Process accessed', which might mean another process interacted with it or could indicate something more. Then there's a Process Create event when whoami.exe is executed. That's interesting because whoami typically reveals user information, which in a malicious context could be used to gather credentials.\n\nLooking closer at the powershell.exe events, some of them involve registry value sets and image loading. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad but can be indicators of malicious behavior if they're part of persistence mechanisms or installing malware components.\n\nThe command line for one of the PowerShell executions is quite long. It looks like it's encoding some plaintext into ciphertext using XOR with a key. The script then sends this data to example.com via an HTTP POST request. That's a red flag because XOR cipher isn't very secure, and sending potentially sensitive data over the internet could be part of exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation and deletion in the Temporary folder. The script creates a .ps1 file, runs it, then deletes it. This is a common tactic by attackers to avoid detection since the malicious script doesn't linger on the system. Also, the file path includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be trying to bypass certain PowerShell execution policies or security measures.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious scripts and network activities suggests possible malicious behavior. The XOR encoding and data exfiltration are strong indicators of an attack. The creation and deletion of temporary files add to the suspicion as they're often used in stealthy attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events related to PowerShell executing suspicious scripts, including XOR encoding and data exfiltration attempts, along with file creation and deletion in a temporary directory.

Let's break down each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with a specific command line. The command seems to be encoding some plaintext using XOR cipher with a key, then sending it via HTTP POST to example.com. This activity stands out because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most events have 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These tasks are related to Windows event logging setup, which might not be suspicious on their own. However, combined with the powershell.exe process, it's something to note.\n\nThere are also a couple of entries where different processes (like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe) load specific files. For instance, one file is MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which is legitimate. Another event shows urlmon.dll being loaded by powershell.exe, which could be part of normal operations but might warrant closer inspection given the other suspicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation event in the winlogbeat directory, which is likely related to data collection and might not be malicious on its own unless it's part of an exfiltration attempt.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe performing XOR-based encoding and sending data over HTTP could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The repeated pattern suggests a possible script running several times, which might be trying to bypass detection or send data in chunks. While there's no direct evidence of malicious intent, the combination of XOR encryption, POST requests to an external domain, and multiple process invocations is concerning.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this could be legitimate activity, like a script used for testing or system administration. But given that the command line consistently shows similar operations across several events, it's more likely indicative of malicious behavior intended to hide data transfer.\n\nSo, after analyzing all these points, the events do raise red flags and suggest potential cybersecurity issues.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits concerning patterns indicative of potential cybersecurity threats:\n\n1. **Repetitive Powershell.exe Activity**: The consistent use of powershell.exe with a specific command line suggests possible scripting for malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.\n\n2. **XOR Encryption and HTTP POST**: The encoding using XOR cipher and sending data to example.com could indicate an attempt to hide data transfer, a common tactic in malware activities.\n\n3. **Windows Event Logs**: While tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' are standard, their pairing with powershell.exe may warrant further investigation.\n\n4. **File Loadings**: Loading legitimate files (MpClient.dll, urlmon.dll) by powershell.exe could be part of normal operations but should be monitored for any anomalies or additional activities.\n\n5. **File Creation Events**: The creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file might be related to data collection, which in some contexts could be linked to malicious exfiltration.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these factors suggests potential malicious activity. While not conclusive proof, the patterns are red flags that merit deeper investigation to ensure there's no ongoing security breach."}

Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: There are multiple instances where 'powershell.exe' is running. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. The tasks associated with it include file creation, registry value sets, and process accesses. These actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious but could indicate something if they occur in combination.\n\nThen there's 'conhost.exe', which is often a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes attackers use it to hide their activities. The RegistryEvent here might be normal system behavior or part of an attack.\n\n'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are both common processes; RuntimeBroker handles runtime events for UWP apps, and svchost is typically used by services. Their registry activity could just be part of standard operations.\n\nI notice a lot of Registry value sets across different processes, especially from 'chrome.exe'. While Chrome does interact with the registry, multiple such events might warrant a closer look, but they're not inherently malicious.\n\nThere are also instances where files are being created or accessed, like the .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe. That seems related to log shipping or monitoring tools, which could be legitimate if part of system setup.\n\nThe loading of urlmon.dll and amsi.dll might raise an eyebrow since these DLLs are sometimes used in attacks for certain functionalities. However, they can also be part of normal operations, especially with components like the Windows Defender platform.\n\nI'm noticing repeated events from 'powershell.exe' accessing processes and registry entries. This could indicate script execution or legitimate administration tasks, but without more context, it's hard to say. The same goes for the multiple RegistryEvents across various processesâ€”they might just be part of normal operation.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some red flags like repeated registry access and loading of certain DLLs, these could still fall within normal system behavior. However, the volume of RegistryEvent tasks from different processes, especially 'powershell.exe', does raise concern about potential malicious activity or script execution.\n\nI'm on the fence here because each individual event doesn't clearly indicate an attack, but when combined, they might suggest some suspicious activity. Therefore, I think this batch is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell execution and registry modifications, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

I'm trying to determine if there's anything malicious or interesting here that would require investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessing different registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused by attackers. The fact that it's creating files in user directories like Downloads and Temp might be suspicious. For example, the file 'estrutura_temporario.txt' created by PowerShell could be part of some malicious script dropping or configuration.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see commands trying to remove specific .bat files. These are scripts, which can execute commands on the system. The use of '-Force' and '-ErrorAction Ignore' in the command line parameters is a red flag because it's common for attackers to suppress errors and force deletion without user confirmation.\n\nThere are multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs. While this isn't necessarily malicious on its own, the combination with file creation and deletion could indicate some form of persistence or payload execution. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might be part of setting up a persistent backdoor or altering system configurations.\n\nAdditionally, Chrome.exe is involved in several Registry value sets. However, since Chrome itself isn't known for malicious activity unless there's an exploit, I'm less concerned about these events compared to the PowerShell activities.\n\nThe overall pattern seems concerning because it involves multiple file operations, registry modifications, and script execution via PowerShell, which could be signs of a potential attack. The repeated attempts to remove specific files might indicate an attempt to erase evidence or clean up after executing some malicious payload.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting due to the combination of file operations, registry changes, and suspicious command-line arguments in PowerShell.exe processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell.exe instances creating and deleting files, accessing registry values, and executing commands that suggest potential malicious activity such as script execution and file removal.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. Each event shows `powershell.exe` being run with commands that delete specific `.bat` files. The command lines are variations like removing items from different paths. This could be normal admin activity or part of malicious scripts trying to clean up traces.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog, there's a mix of Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Image Load, File Create, Registry events, and Process Creates\/Accesses. The repeated use of `Remove-Item` suggests file deletions, which might be an attempt to erase logs or remove malicious files after execution.\n\nI also see other processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. For example, one event runs `cmd.exe` with commands to stop and delete services (`objeto_temporario` and `estrutura_secundario`). This could be part of a service manipulation routine. Additionally, there are multiple Registry events from various processes, which might indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe fact that many events involve known legitimate tools like PowerShell, cmd.exe, and sc.exe being used with potentially malicious commands raises suspicion. The repeated pattern of deleting files across different paths suggests a methodical cleanup, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be part of routine administration, the combinationâ€”especially the specific use of `sc.exe` to stop and delete services, along with multiple PowerShell deletionsâ€”points toward potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is trying to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools.\n\nThe high number of events involving process creations and accesses, coupled with file and registry modifications, makes this batch stand out as non-normal user behavior.

Then I see powershell.exe appearing multiple times, accessing processes and registry values. There's also a whoami.exe execution, which might be checking user privileges or identity.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is creating files and then deleting them quickly, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1. This could be part of some script testing or potentially something malicious trying to hide its tracks by deleting logs.\n\nThere are a lot of ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework DLLs and others, which is normal but might indicate complex scripting or an attempt to load modules for obfuscation.\n\nMultiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks in the logs suggest that PowerShell is being used extensively, maybe running scripts or cmdlets. The repeated use of \"powershell.exe & {}\" in command lines looks suspicious because it's a common technique to execute commands without saving them to a file, which can be harder to detect.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of using cmd and powershell for process creation, registry modifications, file deletions, and multiple lifecycle events raises red flags.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, looking through the events, there are a lot of powershell.exe processes. That catches my attention because PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command and control, lateral movement, and exfiltration. I remember that malicious actors often use it to execute scripts or commands that aren't easily noticeable.\n\nIn these logs, I see several instances where PowerShell is being created (Process Create task) and accessing other processes. That's a bit worrying because process creation events can be indicators of suspicious activity, especially when combined with access to other processes, which might suggest privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nI also notice some file operations. For example, there's a command-line argument in one of the cmd.exe processes that deletes a file in the TEMP directory. The command is \"del \/f \/q \/s %TEMP%\\unidade_auxiliar.exe\". That looks like it's trying to delete a specific file, possibly to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity.\n\nLooking at another event, there are multiple calls to Remove-Item in PowerShell scripts targeting $env:TEMP\\key.log. The fact that they're using -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the user wants to suppress any error messages if the file isn't found, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a mention of mscoree.dll and clr.dll being loaded by PowerShell. Those are .NET framework components, but sometimes attackers load them to execute malicious code or create custom objects for persistence or lateral movement.\n\nI'm concerned about the combination of these activitiesâ€”multiple PowerShell invocations with deletion commands, file creations in user directories (like the StartupProfileData folder), and registry modifications. These behaviors can be indicative of a potential attack chain, from initial compromise to exfiltration.\n\nThe fact that both cmd.exe and conhost.exe are involved adds more layers. Cmd is another tool often used maliciously for command execution and file manipulation, while conhost.exe might be part of legitimate processes but could also be abused.\n\nI should consider the user context too. The events reference \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\", which suggests that this user's account is being targeted. If these activities are happening under a regular user account without proper justification, it raises suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events with similar command lines, especially the ones deleting files in the TEMP directory and removing key.log. Repetition like this can be a sign of automated scripts or tools trying to clean up their tracks after malicious actions.\n\nPutting it all together, while some of these activities could be part of legitimate system administration or user operations, the combinationâ€”especially the PowerShell usage with file deletions and registry modificationsâ€”is concerning. It aligns with common attack patterns for persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows multiple red flags that could indicate malicious behavior. However, without more context like timestamps, user activity around these times, or network traffic analysis, it's hard to be certain. But based on the logs alone, there are enough indicators to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits multiple red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Powershell Usage**: Frequent invocations of powershell.exe with command-line arguments suggest possible exploitation for command and control or lateral movement.\n\n2. **File Deletions**: Commands like `del \/f \/q \/s %TEMP%\\unidade_auxiliar.exe` in cmd.exe indicate attempts to remove files, possibly to erase evidence.\n\n3. **Suppressed Errors**: Use of `-ErrorAction Ignore` in PowerShell scripts when deleting log files (`key.log`) suggests an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n4. **.NET Component Loading**: Loading of mscoree.dll and clr.dll by powershell.exe could be part of malicious code execution or object creation for persistence.\n\n5. **Multiple Tools Involved**: Use of both cmd.exe and conhost.exe alongside PowerShell adds layers that may be part of a coordinated attack.\n\n6. **User Context**: Activities under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\" suggest targeting a specific user account, possibly without legitimate justification.\n\n7. **Repetitive Behavior**: Similar command lines across events indicate automated scripts, which are often used maliciously for cleanup or persistence.\n\nWhile the logs alone cannot confirm malicious activity definitively, the combination of these factors aligns with attack patterns and warrants further investigation to assess potential threats."}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see multiple events where powershell.exe is loading images (Image loaded task). That's normal since PowerShell often loads various DLLs. The file paths like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll are legitimate system files, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, there's a FileCreate event for a temp file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1. That seems unusual because why would PowerShell create a script in the TEMP directory? But looking further, I see that this file is immediately deleted with a FileDeleteDetected task. This could be part of some cleanup routine or maybe an attempt to remove evidence after execution.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe runs a command: Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log. The key.log suggests it's trying to delete a log file in the TEMP directory. Running such commands might indicate someone is cleaning up logs, possibly hiding their tracks. This could be malicious activity or just routine cleanup.\n\nI also notice multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events from PowerShell. These are typical when scripts run, so they're probably not suspicious on their own.\n\nThere's a ProcessCreate event for whoami.exe. That's a legitimate command often used to check user permissions, so it doesn't raise any flags unless combined with other actions.\n\nOther events involve Registry value sets and process accesses by powershell.exe. These are common activities when running scripts that interact with system configurations or other processes.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated deletions of temporary files and log cleanup might indicate an attempt to hide activity. However, without more context like timestamps or additional related events (e.g., dropped files, network traffic), it's hard to confirm malicious intent. It could still be a script running routine tasks. \n\nSo, while there are some red flags, the evidence isn't conclusive enough to classify this batch as definitely suspicious. Therefore, I would label it as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7 since there's a possibility of malicious activity but not enough concrete proof.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal PowerShell activity including file creation, deletion, and loading of legitimate system files.

That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. So multiple instances might indicate suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks, there are ImageLoad events where powershell is loading different DLLs like clrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. While some of these might be legitimate Windows processes, others could be part of malicious payloads or tools trying to hide themselves.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script __PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1. Temporary scripts are often used in attacks to test permissions or execute commands without leaving a trace. The fact that it gets deleted shortly after (FileDeleteDetected) is another sign of attempted stealth.\n\nThere's also a series of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events, which might be part of normal PowerShell operation but could also signal script execution or module loading. These are areas where malicious scripts often operate.\n\nI see whoami.exe being executed a few times. While this command itself isn't malicious, its use in conjunction with other suspicious activities like powershell could indicate an attempt to gather system information for later attacks.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. If this process is legitimate, it's probably harmless, but without more context, I can't be sure if this is part of a logging setup or something else.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags pointing towards potential malicious activity. The combination of powershell.exe events, temporary script creation and deletion, use of whoami.exe, and other system processes raises concerns about possible attack vectors like persistence, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.\n\nHowever, I need to balance this with the possibility that some of these could be normal operations, especially if the system is running scripts or tools that legitimately use PowerShell.

I know that PowerShell can be both a legitimate tool and often used in attacks because it's powerful. But on its own, accessing it isn't necessarily suspicious unless there are other indicators.\n\nNext, there's an event where whoami.exe was created. Whoami is a standard Windows utility to display user information. Its creation alone isn't alarming, but if it's executed with certain command lines or in combination with other tools, that could be concerning.\n\nI notice that the batch has multiple entries of PowerShell being accessed and whoami.exe being created. This repetition might indicate an attempt to gather user information multiple times, which is a common step in lateral movement during attacks. However, without seeing actual malicious commands or file accesses, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nLooking further, some events mention Registry value sets. That could be part of persistence mechanisms, but again, not all registry changes are bad. Legitimate software also modifies the registry.\n\nThere's an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely part of the data collection tool for logs, so that's probably normal unless it's accessing unauthorized files or behaving abnormally.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell accesses and whoami executions might suggest someone probing the system, but without evidence of actual malicious activities like writing to sensitive files, changing permissions, or establishing persistence beyond registry changes, it's not conclusive.
