{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is someone running whoami.exe. That seems normal; it's a common tool to check user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are several PowerShell processes being created and accessed. I know PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command line in one of the events has some interesting parts: \"findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls\" followed by a select-string looking for 'password'. This looks like it's searching through various file types for the word 'pass' or 'password', which could be an attempt to gather sensitive information. That might be malicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading images. While some of these actions are normal for PowerShell scripts, the combination here, especially with the command line mentioned earlier, raises a red flag. Malware often uses such techniques to hide or execute code.\n\nI notice that there's a file being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory by PowerShell. Creating and deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThere are several entries where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle', but without more context, it's hard to say if these are normal or not. They might be related to the PowerShell process initializing components.\n\nAnother event shows Notepad.exe accessing a registry value, which isn't unusual unless there's evidence of modifying sensitive areas.\n\nLastly, Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is standard and likely not an issue.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines, file operations in Temp, and multiple process accesses suggest potential malicious activity. While some events could be benign, the overall pattern points towards something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines searching for sensitive information, including password-related patterns in various file types.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting attacks or malicious activities. The command lines in some of these entries look suspicious. For example, there's a command line that uses findstr to search for the word \"pass\" in various file types like XML and DOC files. That seems unusual; why would someone search for \"pass\" across different documents? It could be looking for passwords or sensitive information, which might indicate data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Registry value set events from svchost.exe and other processes. SvcHost is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware to hide their activities. The fact that several different processes (like OfficeClickToRun.exe and Calculator.exe) are making registry changes could be a sign of something malicious trying to persist on the system.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the repeated Dns query events from chrome.exe. While Chrome does handle DNS queries for normal browsing, multiple such queries without an apparent reason might indicate something more nefarious, like attempting to reach a command-and-control server or part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere's also a File created event by powershell.exe creating a file in the Startup folder. This could be an attempt to persist across reboots, which is a common tactic for malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts up.\n\nAdditionally, some events show Image loaded tasks loading DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While these might seem legitimate, the context of how they're being used alongside other suspicious activities could be concerning.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags that suggest potential malicious behavior. The combination of powershell.exe with command-line arguments searching for sensitive data, multiple registry modifications by various processes, and repeated DNS queries from chrome.exe, along with file creation in the Startup folder, create a pattern that raises suspicion. These activities could be indicative of an attack such as credential harvesting, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear signs that these events are part of normal system operations. The number of suspicious processes and their actions make me confident enough to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities, including PowerShell commands searching for sensitive data, registry modifications by various processes, repeated DNS queries from Chrome.exe, and file creation in the Startup folder. These actions suggest potential malicious behavior such as credential harvesting or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from chrome.exe doing things like loading an image, setting registry values, and making network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot in the background. But then there are several instances where powershell.exe is creating files and accessing processes. For example, it created a file named 'objeto_logico.txt' and another called 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks, but it's also commonly abused by malware. So I'm a bit concerned here.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where schtasks.exe is being used to delete scheduled tasks. The command lines show that they're deleting specific tasks related to \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and others. Deleting tasks could be part of normal system maintenance, but it might also indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nI also see cmd.exe running commands to delete scheduled tasks with schtasks. The command lines are a bit long, which is unusual because legitimate scripts usually aren't that verbose or convoluted. This could be an attempt to hide malicious activity or execute multiple commands in one go, which might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a whoami.exe process being created. While this can be used for legitimate purposes like checking user permissions, it's often used by attackers to gather information about the system. The fact that it's run without any output redirection makes me think maybe it's part of an attacker's early reconnaissance.\n\nAnother thing is the file creations by winlogbeat.exe. WinLogBeat is typically used for log shipping, so this might not be suspicious on its own. But if there are multiple instances creating files quickly, it could indicate something's wrong with how logs are being handled or maybe even log tampering.\n\nThere's also a process where svchost.exe loads taskschd.dll. Svchost is a common process that can host various services, and loading taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. This isn't inherently suspicious unless it's paired with other activities like unusual task creations or deletions.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple uses of PowerShell creating files and accessing processes, deletion of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe and cmd.exe, and a whoami.exe process. These behaviors could indicate possible malicious activity. The repeated use of tools known for both legitimate and malicious purposes raises the suspicion level. Also, the command-line arguments in some cases are trying to delete specific tasks that might have been set up for persistence or malicious behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because there's a combination of activities that don't seem entirely normal. While some events could be part of regular system operations, others, especially the PowerShell and schtasks.exe usages, stand out as potential indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of potentially malicious activities such as suspicious use of PowerShell, deletion of scheduled tasks, and use of whoami.exe.

I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nLooking through each event:\n\n1. **schtasks.exe** being used with commands like `\/delete` and specific task names seems suspicious because it's often used for scheduling tasks, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n2. **svchost.exe** is a legitimate process but in combination with registry changes, it might indicate something malicious.\n3. Multiple instances of **powershell.exe**, **cmd.exe**, and **whoami.exe** running with specific commands that modify the registry or delete users are red flags. These tools are commonly used by attackers for various purposes like privilege escalation or system configuration changes.\n4. The use of **WMIC.exe** to delete processes is concerning because WMIC can be used maliciously to execute commands remotely, and deleting processes could hide traces.\n5. Commands like `net user \/del` indicate attempts to delete users, which is a clear sign of potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple processes being executed with potentially malicious intent: modifying tasks, registry entries, and deleting system accounts. This combination suggests possible unauthorized activity, such as an attacker trying to clean up traces or escalate privileges. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including the deletion of system tasks, registry modifications, and attempts to delete user accounts using cmd.exe, net.exe, and powershell.exe.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, sc.exe, services.exe are being executed. Notably, several of these have command lines that suggest they're performing deletion or modification tasks. For example, \"cmd.exe \/c net user ... \/del \/domain\" and similar commands for deleting users and services.\n\nI see repeated attempts to delete user accounts using net.exe and net1.exe, which could indicate an attempt to remove administrative accounts or disrupt the system's user structure. Also, the use of sc.exe to delete a service (win32times) might be part of efforts to disable monitoring or security-related services.\n\nAnother point is the multiple registry modifications. Processes like services.exe are modifying the registry, possibly to remove traces of malicious activities or to establish persistence mechanisms. This could be a sign of an attacker trying to clean up logs or create backdoors.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe might be to check user privileges or permissions, which is common during reconnaissance phases of an attack. Additionally, powershell.exe being accessed multiple times is concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities like executing scripts or downloading files.\n\nLooking at the frequency, many of these events occur in quick succession, which could suggest automated or script-based attacks rather than manual actions. This pattern increases the suspicion that it's not normal user activity but something more nefarious.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a clear pattern of attempts to modify system configurations, delete users and services, and manipulate the registry—all signs that an attacker might be present on the system. These activities could lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or disabling of security measures.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple attempts to delete user accounts and services, registry modifications, and process creations involving potentially malicious tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is being accessed or created. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. The first event shows PowerShell accessing the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there are several cmd.exe processes deleting files in the Temp directory. Deleting temporary files might be an attempt to cover tracks by removing evidence of previous activity. The command lines look suspicious with del commands pointing to specific files like *.txt and .exe, which might have been used maliciously before deletion.\n\nThen, I notice a whoami.exe process running. While this is a standard system tool, it's often used by attackers to check the current user context, potentially leading up to privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where PowerShell is being created with command lines that just execute \"& {}\". This seems unusual because it doesn't specify any obvious malicious script, but empty command lines can be a way to hide malicious activities. Alternatively, it might indicate script injection or the use of reflection to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was both created and then deleted by PowerShell. The creation of __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 in the Temp directory suggests that PowerShell might have been executing some script, possibly for persistence or malicious activities. The subsequent deletion could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry value sets across different processes (cmd.exe and powershell.exe). Modifying the registry can be part of creating persistent backdoors or altering system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nThe image loads in PowerShell indicate that it's loading various .NET and other framework components, which is normal but could also mask malicious activities if those modules are being misused.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of powershell.exe with empty command lines, cmd.exe deleting files, whoami.exe execution, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and registry modifications. These patterns collectively suggest possible malicious activity such as script execution, evidence cleanup, persistence mechanisms, and potential lateral movement or privilege checks.\n\nSo, the batch is definitely interesting for investigation because it exhibits several signs of potentially malicious behavior that could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, including file deletions in the Temp directory, registry modifications, and suspicious command-line arguments.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are multiple entries from powershell.exe and other processes like whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, etc.\n\nFirst, the high frequency of powershell.exe catches my eye. It's being executed several times with various tasks. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a vector for attacks since it has powerful cmdlets that can execute code and access system resources.\n\nI see events where powershell.exe creates files, accesses processes, loads images, and interacts with the registry. These activities alone aren't necessarily malicious, but when combined with other indicators, they could raise suspicions. For example, creating a file in specific locations or accessing certain registry keys might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where whoami.exe is run. This tool is used to identify user accounts and can be used by attackers to gather information about system permissions. The fact that it's called several times could indicate reconnaissance activities.\n\nOther processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe also show up with registry accesses or image loads. These are common processes but their activities here might be part of a larger pattern. Notably, svchost.exe is a known legitimate process, but it's often targeted by malware to hide malicious activities.\n\nThe combination of these events could indicate an attacker using multiple tools and techniques for persistence, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the system. The use of powershell, which is commonly used in cyberattacks, alongside other utilities like whoami, suggests potential malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, without more context on the exact commands run or the file contents, it's hard to be certain.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with one classification, justification, and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. There are 13 events in total.\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe**: This is the first event. Winlogbeat is typically an agent used for collecting Windows logs, so this process creating a file like .winlogbeat.yml.new might be normal. It's setting up or updating its configuration file.\n\n2. **powershell.exe accessed**: PowerShell being accessed could be concerning because it's often used by attackers for command execution. However, without seeing actual commands executed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\n3. **whoami.exe ran**: Whoami is a standard Windows tool that shows user information. It's usually not malicious unless run in a specific context or with elevated privileges, but in isolation, it's benign.\n\n4. **powershell.exe accessed again**: This repetition could be part of a script or legitimate activity, but repeated access might warrant attention.\n\n5. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe modified registry**: Application Frame Host is part of Windows and handles application windows. Registry modifications here are common for app settings, so likely not suspicious.\n\n6. **Calculator.exe modified registry**: Calculator is a basic system tool. It shouldn't be making registry changes, which makes this event interesting. Maybe it's malicious or a misconfiguration.\n\n7. **chrome.exe made multiple DNS queries and network connections**: Chrome doing DNS lookups and connecting to the network is normal for browsing. The repetition could indicate background updates or tabs being opened, but nothing seems off here.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch together:\n\n- **benign activities**: Winlogbeat setting up logs, whoami executed, ApplicationFrameHost modifying registry, chrome's usual behavior.\n- **potentially suspicious**: Calculator.exe making a registry change. Since calculator doesn't typically modify the registry, this stands out as unusual.\n- **powershell accessed twice**: Could be part of legitimate scripts or user activity, but combined with the other events, it adds some concern.\n\nSo, while most events are normal, the Calculator modifying the registry and powershell being accessed might indicate something's amiss. However, without more context like actual commands run in PowerShell or specific registry changes, it's hard to be certain. The confidence level would be lower because there's no clear malicious activity confirmed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events such as powershell.exe accesses and a whoami.exe execution, which could indicate potential lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.
