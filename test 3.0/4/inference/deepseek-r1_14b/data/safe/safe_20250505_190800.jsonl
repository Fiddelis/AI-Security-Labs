{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. There are a bunch of log events that I need to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event and note down the key details.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's winlogbeat.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is usually used for collecting logs, so that seems normal. The next few events involve mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE setting registry values. That's also standard because these are system processes.\n\nThen I notice several powershell.exe entries. The first one is a process creation event without any command line arguments provided initially, which might be normal, but later there's a command line with \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\". Setting Execution Policy to Bypass is a red flag because it allows running scripts that are otherwise blocked. That could indicate an attempt to execute potentially malicious code.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe is loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are legitimate for PowerShell's operation. However, there are also events where files are created and deleted in the Temp directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. This might be a script testing execution policies or trying to bypass restrictions.\n\nAnother point is multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe, which could indicate it's being started or stopped, possibly part of some automated process. But the use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass suggests intent to run scripts without user consent, which is suspicious in certain contexts.\n\nI also see that powershell.exe is loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are related to Windows Defender. This might be normal if Defender's scripts are running through PowerShell, but it could also be a way to hide malicious activity by appearing legitimate.\n\nIn summary, while some events are typical system activities, the use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass and script execution in the Temp directory stand out as concerning signs that could indicate malicious behavior. The combination of these actions across multiple log entries increases the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious PowerShell activities, such as setting registry values and executing scripts with bypassed execution policies, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, all these events are related to PowerShell.exe processes. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and lateral movement within a network. The initial events show that powershell.exe is accessing different files and registry values. Specifically, there are multiple ImageLoad events loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. This could be part of normal operations since .NET framework components are legitimate.\n\nThen, I notice two FileCreate events by PowerShell: one for a PS script in the Temp directory and another for a StartupProfileData file. The first script is deleted immediately after being created, which seems suspicious. Typically, scripts created and then deleted might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms. Also, the script name \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1\" looks like it's trying to blend in as a system-generated file, but that could be part of obfuscation techniques.\n\nThere's also a FileDeleteDetected event for that same temporary script, which suggests the system detected an attempt to delete a file. This might be a sign of malicious activity trying to remove traces of its actions. Additionally, there's an Execute Remote Command task logged, which is another concerning behavior because it can indicate remote code execution or command injection attacks.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple file and registry interactions by PowerShell, the creation and deletion of a temporary script that looks like it could be malicious, and a remote command execution attempt. These patterns are common in attack chainsâ€”using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, creating\/deleting files to avoid detection, and executing commands remotely. \n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because these activities together show potential signs of malicious behavior rather than normal operations. The confidence is high because the combination of events points towards possible exploitation or persistence techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file and registry interactions by PowerShell, including creation and deletion of a temporary script with suspicious naming, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
