Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The first thing I notice is that all these events are related to file creation tasks.\n\nThe process name is always \"git.exe\", and the task under winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". That makes sense because Git uses various files during its operations, like cloning repositories or managing projects. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located within a directory that seems to be part of a Node.js project—specifically, \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\". These are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts), which are typically used by TypeScript developers for type checking in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nSo, each event is git.exe creating a file in this specific node_modules directory. Since these events all point to legitimate Git operations related to project setup and file creation, there doesn't seem to be any malicious behavior here. It's just standard activity from someone working on a software project using Git and Node.js with Cypress and Lodash dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious actions.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events, and they all seem pretty similar. Each one is a JSON object indicating that the git.exe process created a file. The files are all in the node_modules folder under cypress\/types\/lodash with various .d.ts extensions. \n\nHmm, so the first thing I notice is that the process name is consistent across all events—git.exe. That makes sense because when you're working with version control systems like Git, it's common for processes to create files as part of operations like cloning repositories or installing dependencies.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to TypeScript definition files in a Cypress project. The node_modules directory is where npm packages are stored, so these are likely part of the Cypress testing framework and its lodash type definitions. The .d.ts extension confirms that these are declaration files, which are standard in TypeScript projects to provide type information for JavaScript libraries.\n\nThe winlog task mentions \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" each time. This is a Windows event indicating that a file was created. Since all events are from the same process and target known legitimate files within a project structure, there's no indication of anything suspicious here.\n\nI'm thinking about whether multiple file creations in this context could be indicative of malicious activity. Generally, attackers might try to create files in unexpected locations or execute processes that aren't typical for the user or environment. However, in this case, the files are all within a standard project setup, and git.exe is a common process that would indeed create files as part of its operations.\n\nAnother angle to consider: Could these events be related to a recent clone or update of a repository? If someone was setting up or updating their development environment, it's normal for Git to clone or fetch new files, including the ones under node_modules. The Cypress dependency is also something developers would intentionally install, so this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nI should also think about whether there's anything unusual in the frequency of these events. Since each event corresponds to a different file being created and they're all within the same directory structure, it seems plausible that Git was performing an operation that involved creating multiple files at once, perhaps during a bulk operation or as part of an automated script.\n\nIn terms of potential indicators of compromise (IoCs), I don't see any here. The process name is legitimate, the file paths are within expected project directories, and the event type is standard for file creation activities. There's no evidence of files being created in system directories, execution of unknown scripts, or other behaviors that could suggest malware or unauthorized access.\n\nMoreover, considering the context given in the file paths—S206 Qualidade de Software—this might be a student project or educational environment where installing testing frameworks is common. This further reduces any suspicion of malicious intent.\n\nIn conclusion, while each event individually is normal, looking at the entire batch together doesn't present any signs of concerning behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events. Let me see what's going on here. All the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures. The \"process\" field has the name \"git.exe\", and the \"winlog\" shows that a file was created with the rule \"FileCreate\". The files being created are various \".d.ts\" files located in a path under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\".\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that all these events are coming from the same process, git.exe. Git is commonly used for version control, and when it's cloning or pulling a repository, it can create multiple files in a directory. The fact that they're creating .d.ts files suggests these are TypeScript definition files, which makes sense if someone is working with Node.js or TypeScript projects.\n\nThe file paths all point to a specific node_modules folder within a Cypress types directory for lodash functions. This indicates that the user might be setting up or updating their development environment, perhaps installing or reinstalling dependencies related to Cypress and Lodash. Each event corresponds to a different function in lodash, like \"toLength.d.ts\", \"toLower.d.ts\", etc.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting for investigation. Since all these events are about creating files during a git operation, it's pretty standard behavior when someone is working with their codebase. There's nothing unusual here—no signs of file deletions, access to sensitive directories, or other actions that could indicate malicious activity.\n\nHowever, one thing I should consider is the frequency and number of these events. If this happened only once, it's normal. But if there are multiple such batches in a short period without any other related activities, maybe it's worth looking into why git.exe is creating so many files at once. Maybe an automated script or a CI\/CD process is doing this, but that wouldn't necessarily be suspicious.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools like git for malicious purposes, such as downloading malicious scripts and checking them out in bulk. But looking at the file paths, they seem to be standard TypeScript definitions for Lodash functions, which are commonly used libraries without any red flags.\n\nAnother angle is whether \"git.exe\" was executed from an unexpected location or user account. If this activity occurred on a system where development tools aren't typically used, that could raise eyebrows. But in the context of a user who's actively developing software, especially with TypeScript and Cypress, it would be expected.\n\nI also think about how these events look together as a whole. The repetition of similar file creation events under the same directory suggests a systematic process, which aligns with git cloning or fetching multiple files at once rather than manual file operations.\n\nIn summary, while every security event needs to be evaluated for its context, in this case, there's no clear indicator of suspicious behavior. It looks like normal development activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events represents normal development activity related to the creation of TypeScript definition files by Git during a repository clone or pull operation. All events are consistent with standard file operations under a Node.js project using Cypress and Lodash, indicating legitimate development work rather than malicious behavior.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe log entries indicate normal development activities where `git.exe` is creating several `.d.ts` files as part of cloning or updating a repository. These files are TypeScript definitions for Lodash functions within a Node.js project using Cypress. There's no evidence of suspicious activity, so this batch isn't particularly concerning for cybersecurity purposes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": \"git.exe\",\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"event_id\": \"4656\",\n    \"message\": \"File created\"\n  },\n  \"file_info\": {\n    \"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\.d.ts\",\n    \"name\": \"toLength.d.ts\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object with the same structure: process name as \"git.exe\", task as \"File created\" from winlog, and file paths all under the node_modules folder for cypress and lodash.\n\nHmm, so git.exe is often used for version control, but seeing it create multiple files in the node_modules directory seems off. Typically, when you install npm packages, you run commands like `npm install`, which would download and extract these modules. But here, git.exe is creating these files. That's unusual because git isn't usually involved in installing or managing node modules.\n\nI should check if this is a common behavior. I know that sometimes scripts might use git for other purposes, but in this context, it doesn't seem right. The files being created are all .d.ts files under lodash, which are TypeScript declaration files. Installing these via npm would typically not involve git.exe creating them.\n\nAlso, the same process is creating multiple files in quick succession. This could be a sign of automated file creation or something scripted, but without context, it's hard to say. However, given that it's using git for file operations related to node modules, there might be cause for concern.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of git.exe and multiple file creations in a node_modules directory isn't typical user behavior. It could indicate an attempt at tampering with the system or installing malicious software that's mimicking normal package installations but using different tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory may indicate unusual activity, possibly related to package installation or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
