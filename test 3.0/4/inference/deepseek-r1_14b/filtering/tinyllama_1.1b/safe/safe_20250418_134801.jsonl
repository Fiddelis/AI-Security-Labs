Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where Microsoft Edge is updating or something with a setup.exe. That seems normal because software updates are common and not necessarily malicious unless it's an unusual path.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll—that's part of Windows Antimalware Scan Interface, so that's a standard process to detect threats.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating a pipe. Not immediately suspicious, could be part of legitimate software installation processes.\n\nThere are several events related to User Account Management and Special Logon tasks. These might indicate account activity or privilege changes, but without context on what specific actions were taken, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries—svchost is a common process for running various services. The registry value sets are typical as part of system operations and don't raise red flags on their own.\n\nThere's a powershell.exe command execution with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That catches my eye because PowerShell can be used maliciously, but \"Restricted\" usually means it's less privileged and might be for benign tasks like script checking or updates. However, the exact command isn't clearly harmful from the snippet provided.\n\nMultiple instances of taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll are normal since Task Scheduler uses that DLL. No signs of tampering here.\n\nChrome.exe making DNS queries is standard behavior for web browsing.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file seems like it's part of log shipping, which is expected if they're using the ELK stack or similar tools.\n\nMpCmdRun and MpClient from Windows Defender loading are normal as part of antivirus operations. The fact that they're loading their components doesn't indicate any issues unless there's an unusual path or version mismatch.\n\nConhost.exe interacting with registry values could be part of console services, which is typical for command-line processes.\n\nGit.exe creating files in a node_modules directory is standard during development or when cloning repositories. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are multiple events that individually aren't concerning, I don't see a clear pattern or combination that suggests malicious behavior. The system logs appear to be capturing normal operations, updates, and legitimate processes. There's no evidence of unusual file creations in suspicious locations, unexpected network communications, or signs of compromised accounts.\n\nHowever, the powershell.exe command with ExecutionPolicy Restricted is something to note. It might warrant closer inspection, but without more context on what that script does, it's hard to classify this batch as definitely malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system activities such as software updates, legitimate process executions, and standard user account management operations.

Let me start by looking at what these logs are showing.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which tells me that the Git command-line tool is involved here. The winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so this indicates that files are being created on the system. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to a user named fiddelis in their Downloads folder under a specific course called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The directory structure goes into node_modules\/semver and various subfiles like functions\/*.js, internal files, preload.js, etc. \n\nI know that Git can be used for version control, especially with projects that use Node.js, given the presence of node_modules. Semver is a package related to semantic versioning, which is commonly used in software development to manage dependencies.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, it seems like someone is cloning or setting up a repository that includes the semver package. The multiple file creation events are part of the Git checkout process when downloading project files and their dependencies. \n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like strange filenames, access to unusual directories, or processes running outside expected behaviors for Git and Node.js. All activities are standard during a repository clone or setup.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's just normal user activity related to software development.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the creation of files related to Git and Node.js semver package during a project setup or clone, which is normal and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, it's probably not interesting for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation activities during the setup or update of Node.js packages in a development environment, which is normal and expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format and contains information about processes, Windows logs, and file operations. The task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events have \"git.exe\" as the process name. That makes me think these are related to Git operations. The Winlog field shows that each event is a \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that files are being created on the system. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under the same user directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. This path seems to be part of a Node.js project structure because I see folders like \"node_modules\", which is typical in npm package installations. The files created include various JavaScript modules, package.json files, test scripts, and documentation files like README.md.\n\nSince all these events are happening under the same directory and involve creating node_modules, it's likely that someone is installing or updating Node.js packages using npm (Node Package Manager). Git being involved suggests that perhaps they're working on a version control project where dependencies are managed via npm. \n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All activities are consistent with normal software development practices—installing packages, creating files in a project directory. There's no indication of file creation outside expected paths or anything related to malicious activity like unauthorized access or suspicious file types.\n\nSo considering all these points, the batch doesn't show any red flags. It looks like routine operations during software development.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe in a Node.js project directory, which is typical for developers managing dependencies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm given a series of JSONL entries where each line represents an event. The process name in all these events is \"git.exe\", and the task is \"File created\". Each file path starts with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\" followed by various node_modules directories, like \"sshpk\" and others.\n\nSo first off, I notice that all these events are coming from Git. Since Git is a version control system, it's common for it to create files when cloning repositories or during other operations. The file paths in the events are typical for a Node.js project setup, especially with modules like sshpk and string-width. These look like standard npm packages.\n\nI should consider whether creating these files could indicate malicious activity. Usually, Git doesn't do anything malicious on its own. If a user is cloning a repository or initializing it, Git would create necessary files. The fact that all the events are from the same process and involve creating files in a predictable structure makes me think this is normal behavior.\n\nLooking at the file paths again, they include directories like \"node_modules\", which is standard for Node.js projects. Each module has its own folder with JS files, package.json, etc. This isn't something out of place unless there's an unusual pattern or access times that suggest tampering, but nothing here points to that.\n\nAlso, all events are marked as file creations. If this were a breach, I might expect more varied activities like deletions, modifications, or accesses outside the usual directories. There's no indication of writes to sensitive files or attempts to execute scripts; it's purely about creating files in standard locations.\n\nThe user account is \"fiddelis\", which seems like a regular username. The fact that all events are under this user doesn't raise any red flags unless there's evidence of compromised credentials, which isn't present here.\n\nIn summary, the pattern looks consistent with legitimate Git operations during project setup or cloning. No signs of unusual file accesses or creations in sensitive areas. Therefore, I don't see any reason to flag this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal Git operations creating files within a Node.js project structure, indicating legitimate activity rather than malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL events here, each one is an event from the Windows log. Each line has three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file info.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"} which means the Git executable is involved. The task in the winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so it's creating files. The file paths are pointing to different locations within a directory structure under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\".\n\nI notice that each event has the same process name and task, just varying file paths. These seem like they're all part of installing or updating Node.js packages since node_modules is a common directory for Node projects. The files created are things like package.json, license files, readme.md, index.js, etc., which are typical for npm modules.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting for investigation: Since all events are from the same process (git.exe) creating expected files in a node_modules folder during what looks like a package installation or clone operation, there's nothing unusual here. No signs of unauthorized access, suspicious file creation outside normal operations, or indicators of malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, these logs don't raise any red flags and seem entirely legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the Git process creating files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during Node.js package installations or updates.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at these JSON lines, each representing an event. They all seem to have similar structures: process name is \"git.exe\", the task is a file creation under Windows (as indicated by winlog.task being \"File created\"), and the file paths are pointing to various JavaScript files in a directory.\n\nFirst, I notice that every event involves git.exe creating a file. The paths are all within a node_modules folder, specifically under tcomb\/lib. Tcomb is a library for TypeScript combinatorics, so it's common in Node.js projects. All these files being created are part of this module.\n\nNow, why would multiple files being created by git.exe catch my attention? Well, git can do various things like cloning repositories, pulling updates, or checking out branches, which might involve creating new files. It's not unusual for a user to clone a repository that includes node_modules, so these events could just be part of normal development activities.\n\nI should consider the possibility of malicious activity. Could an attacker use git.exe to create files? While possible, it's more likely in this context that someone is working with Node.js and TypeScript projects. The files being created are all standard library files for a module, which doesn't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nAnother angle: Are these events happening too frequently or at unusual times? Without additional context like timestamps or user behavior, it's hard to say. If this happened during off-hours without corresponding user activity, that might be suspicious, but the data here doesn't provide that info.\n\nAlso, looking at the file paths, they all end with .js and are in a lib folder. There's no indication of any executable files or scripts being created beyond what's expected from node_modules. No signs of payload execution or hidden files that could indicate malware.\n\nI should also think about whether git.exe is commonly used for malicious purposes. While it can be abused, its primary function is version control. Unless there are unusual commands or file accesses alongside these events, it doesn't seem concerning.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which aligns with normal development processes. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious behavior from the given logs. Therefore, I would classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it likely represents legitimate user activity rather than anything suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development activities and doesn't indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each line is a separate event. Let me parse them one by one.\n\nThe first event says the process name is \"git.exe\". That's pretty common because Git is widely used for version control. The Windows log task is \"File created\" with a specific rule, and the file path points to a .js file in a node_modules directory. Node modules are standard for JavaScript projects, so that doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThe second event repeats the same process name, \"git.exe\", again logs a file creation, and the file path is another .js file under the same node_modules directory. Same goes for the third event—it's another file being created by git.exe in the same location.\n\nPutting them together, all three events are related to Git creating files during development. Since these activities are typical when working with Node.js projects using Git, there's no indication of malicious behavior here. It doesn't trigger any red flags like unexpected paths or unusual file accesses.\n\nI don't see any signs of compromise or unauthorized activity.
