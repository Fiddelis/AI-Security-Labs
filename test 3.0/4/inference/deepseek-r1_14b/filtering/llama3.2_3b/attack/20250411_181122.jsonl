Let's break down what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. Some show the command line with a script that uses `findstr` and `select-string` to search for \"password\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. This pattern repeats several times, which might indicate an attempt to gather sensitive information.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where temporary files are created and then deleted by PowerShell. Specifically, a script is saved to the Temp directory and immediately deleted after creation. Such behavior can be a red flag for malicious activities because it's often used to avoid detection by leaving no trace on the disk.\n\nThe batch also includes registry modifications and file operations (like creating and deleting files), which are common in attacks trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations without being noticed.\n\nMoreover, there are attempts to load various DLLs through PowerShell, which could be part of obfuscating malicious activities or loading components for further actions. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks suggest that the PowerShell instance is doing something significant enough to trigger these events multiple times.\n\nWhile some events seem benign, like the Calculator.exe loading a system DLL, the sheer number of suspicious PowerShell activities with search patterns and file operations stands out. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at data exfiltration or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity including searching for sensitive information, creating and deleting temporary files, and loading various DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. I'll start by going through each event and noting any patterns or potential red flags.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there are multiple entries from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set', 'Dns query', and 'Image loaded'. These seem normal for a browser process as they're common activities when using Chrome—like loading DLLs and making DNS requests. Nothing suspicious here on their own.\n\nThen I see events from 'winlogbeat.exe', which is likely the agent responsible for collecting Windows logs. It's creating files, which makes sense for its operation. So that's expected behavior and not a concern.\n\nNext, there are some activities involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be used maliciously, but it also has legitimate uses. However, one event shows a file being created named 'estrutura_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. That filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nFurther down, there are several instances of 'cmd.exe' processes creating tasks or deleting them using schtasks. The command lines show deletion of specific scheduled tasks like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and others. This is concerning because an attacker might delete legitimate system tasks to avoid detection or to remove competing malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where 'schtasks.exe' is used to delete more tasks. This could indicate someone trying to clean up their tracks by removing scheduled jobs that might have been created during malicious activity.\n\nAlso, I notice a 'whoami.exe' process being spawned. While this can be benign (like checking user information), it's often used in attacks to gather system details, which is another point of interest.\n\nThere are also events where 'cmd.exe' and 'conhost.exe' are modifying the registry. Registry modifications can be part of both legitimate software operations and malicious activities like persistence mechanisms. The exact keys modified would matter here, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe) accessing or creating files, deleting scheduled tasks, and modifying the registry are signs that could indicate malicious activity. These actions are often used by attackers for persistence, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The combination of these events across different processes makes the batch interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creations and deletions of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe and cmd.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me try to make sense of what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of process creations and registry activity. Processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, net.exe, sc.exe, and whoami.exe are being executed with various command lines. These commands often involve deleting users, groups, or services, which could be signs of system cleanup or privilege escalation.\n\nFor example, there's a command line: \"cmd.exe \/c net user \/del \\\"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\\\"\". This looks like it's trying to delete a user account named \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". Similarly, other commands are deleting different users and groups. This kind of activity could be part of an attack where the adversary is removing traces or accounts they created.\n\nLooking at the files accessed, most entries don't have file paths, but some do. WMIC.exe accessing amsi.dll might be trying to bypass antivirus detection since AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) can detect malicious activities. The use of multiple command-line tools in sequence suggests automation, possibly from a script or toolset used by attackers.\n\nThere's also an attempt to delete the \"win32times\" service using sc.exe and cmd.exe. This might be part of removing backdoors or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, deleting files in temporary directories could indicate efforts to remove evidence of malicious activities.\n\nThe repeated use of whoami.exe is interesting. It’s often used to check the current user context, which attackers might do to escalate privileges or switch accounts. The combination of these actions—deleting users, groups, services, and checking permissions—strongly suggests malicious intent.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events don't have process names, but they do have winlog tasks like User Account Management and Security Group Management. These could be part of the attack chain as well, showing changes to system accounts or permissions.\n\nOverall, the pattern here is consistent with a potential attack where an adversary is attempting to clean up their tracks by deleting user accounts, groups, services, and possibly removing files related to malicious activities. The use of multiple command-line tools and scripts further supports this being part of a coordinated attack rather than normal system operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch definitely looks interesting from a security standpoint because it shows signs of potentially malicious activity aimed at compromising the system's integrity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious activity, including user deletion attempts, service removals, and evidence of command-line tool usage commonly associated with attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and script injection, so repeated instances could be suspicious. Looking at the details:\n\n- There are multiple events where powershell.exe is launched with \"&{}\", which is an unusual way to execute commands. This might indicate obfuscation or misuse.\n  \n- Some events show registry value changes (RegistryEvent), which can be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\n- There's a File Delete event for a .ps1 file in the Temp directory. Deleting scripts after execution can help erase traces, a common tactic in attacks.\n\nHowever, there are also non-suspicious activities. For instance:\n  \n- Events from winlogbeat.exe creating files seem benign, possibly part of log management.\n  \n- Processes like whoami.exe and calc.exe don't raise red flags on their own but could be used as part of broader malicious activity.\n\nThe batch combines several elements that could indicate malicious behavior: multiple PowerShell invocations with unusual command lines, registry modifications, file deletions, and the use of potentially malicious scripts. These factors together suggest a possible attack, even if some events are normal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with unusual command lines and registry modifications, along with file deletions and other activities that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format with process name, winlog task, and file info.\n\nThe first two events are from powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. However, these events don't show any malicious activity; just that the process was accessed.\n\nNext, there's an event from ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying a registry value. This seems normal as application frameworks often interact with the registry. Without more context or unusual behavior, it doesn't raise flags.\n\nThe majority of events are from chrome.exe detecting network connections. Chrome regularly establishes connections for web browsing, so this is expected and not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, all these events seem within normal operations. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Each event individually doesn't indicate anything wrong, and together they don't form a pattern that's concerning.\n\nSo, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence because the actions are routine and pose no immediate threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal process access and network connection activities without any indication of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
