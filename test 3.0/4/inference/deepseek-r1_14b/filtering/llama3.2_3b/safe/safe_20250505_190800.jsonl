{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of events. I'm looking at multiple log entries all related to PowerShell.exe activities on a system. The first thing that catches my eye is the frequency of PowerShell being usedâ€”there are several instances here.\n\nLooking closer, each event shows different tasks like Process Create, Image Load, and File Create. For example, there's a file creation in \"C:\\Users\\...\\teste.ps1\" which stands out as a script might be executed from there. Also, the paths like Temporary files under AppData could indicate script execution or testing.\n\nThe repeated use of Registry value sets and loading various DLLs (like clrjit.dll) suggests that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts or perform operations that require specific libraries. This combination makes me suspicious because attackers often abuse legitimate tools like PowerShell for lateral movement or payload delivery.\n\nMoreover, the creation of temporary files with names like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" might be a red flag. These could be related to script injection or testing permissions. The multiple instances and varied file operations don't align with normal user activity; instead, they look more like a script running multiple commands.\n\nIn conclusion, this batch shows unusual PowerShell activities that could indicate malicious behavior. I'm confident enough to classify this as interesting but not certain it's definitely malicious without further context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files and loading images, which may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
