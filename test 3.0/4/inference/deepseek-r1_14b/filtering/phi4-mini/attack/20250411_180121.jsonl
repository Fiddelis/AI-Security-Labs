{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several events involving `chrome.exe` with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome does make network requests and DNS lookups regularly. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I notice the `powershell.exe` process appearing multiple times. The first event shows that PowerShell was started with a specific command line argument. It looks like it's downloading files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files, but sometimes attackers use such files as a cover for malicious scripts or other payloads. The fact that the file is being saved to the TEMP directory might be concerning because that's a common spot for temporary files, which could also be used by malware.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell creates and then deletes a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1. Creating and deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection or leave fewer traces, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity. Also, the repeated downloading of files using WebClient's DownloadFile method could indicate that this script is fetching multiple components or modules from different repositories.\n\nAnother point is the occurrence of 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks in the logs. I'm not entirely sure what that entails, but it might be related to how PowerShell manages its execution environment. It's a bit unclear whether this is normal behavior or something more nefarious.\n\nThere are also several registry value sets and image loads from the .NET framework directories. While legitimate software can do this, frequent writes to the registry without clear purpose could be suspicious, especially if combined with other activities like file downloads and deletions.\n\nThe events where `chrome.exe` is modifying registry values might just be standard operation for browser updates or settings changes, but I should consider whether these are out of the ordinary. If Chrome were behaving abnormally, that would add more concern, but without additional context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with command-line arguments that download files from various GitHub repositories and create\/deleted temporary files is concerning. This pattern suggests possible script execution, which could be for malicious purposes. The combination of multiple file downloads, registry changes, and temporary file operations without clear justification makes this batch stand out as potentially suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events indicating file downloads from GitHub repositories, creation\/deletion of temporary files, and potential script execution.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit unusual because Chrome doesn't typically modify the registry much in its normal operation. But since it's repeated three times, it might be worth looking into if these are legitimate actions or signs of tampering.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process with a command line that tries to download a file from GitHub. This immediately raises red flags because downloading files directly from the internet, especially through raw.githubusercontent.com, can be a common method for distributing malicious payloads. The script is being executed via the command line, which could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code.\n\nAnother PowerShell event shows the creation of a file in the user's Downloads folder. This could be part of a download process or maybe setting up files for further actions. Again, since it's PowerShell, this needs careful scrutiny because scripts can do a lot of damage quickly.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe are modifying registry values. These are known to be used by various legitimate and malicious software, so their activity could indicate potential threats. The frequency here might suggest some automated or persistent behavior.\n\nLooking at the network connection event from MpDefenderCoreService.exe is interesting. It's a process related to Windows Defender, so an unexpected network connection could mean that it's either compromised or being used as part of an attack.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, but the fact that it's creating a new .yml file might be part of its setup. However, if this process isn't expected on the system, it could signal an intruder setting up logging tools to collect data.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe and cmd.exe with commands like SCHTASKS \/Delete suggests potential attempts to delete scheduled tasks. This is a classic tactic in persistence mechanisms where attackers try to remove their own tasks or disrupt legitimate ones, indicating possible malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several red flags: unauthorized file downloads via PowerShell, multiple registry modifications by various processes, and signs of process manipulation using cmd.exe. These activities collectively indicate a high probability of malicious intent. The confidence level is around 0.85 because while some events might have legitimate explanations, the combination points strongly towards an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including file downloads from external sources, registry modifications by various processes, and potential attempts to delete scheduled tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. I'm going to walk through each event and see what they're showing.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple instances of processes being created and accessed, especially powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's a powerful tool for scripting and system administration. But not all powershell usage is bad—it can be legitimate too. However, in this case, I notice some command lines that might raise flags.\n\nOne event shows schtasks.exe being used with the command line \"\/Delete \/TN spawn \/F\". Schtasks is used to schedule tasks, so deleting a task named \"spawn\" could indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. Attackers often delete traces of their activities or remove tools they don't need anymore.\n\nThen there are several cmd.exe events, including one where it's used to execute REG DELETE commands targeting specific registry entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is suspicious because attackers often clean up logs or remove indicators of their presence by deleting registry entries that might be used for persistence. The fact that they're using cmd.exe with \/c and redirecting output (nul) to suppress messages adds to the suspicion—it looks like they're trying to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a command line in one of the events: \"powershell.exe & {}\". This seems unusual because it just ends with an ampersand, which might be part of a larger script or a way to execute something without proper logging. Powershell is known for being versatile, and sometimes malicious scripts are obfuscated or split across multiple commands.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads various .NET framework components. While this could be normal if it's part of legitimate scripting, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me think it's more concerning. The repeated use of RegistryEvent tasks suggests modifications to system configurations, which is a common tactic for attackers to maintain persistence or change system behaviors.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and the sequence of events, I can see that multiple tools are being used in quick succession—schtasks.exe, cmd.exe with reg delete commands, and powershell.exe. This pattern isn't typical of normal user activity; it looks more like someone trying to achieve specific goals through command-line tools.\n\nAlso, the use of whoami.exe is present a couple times. While this could be for legitimate purposes like checking permissions or user information, in the context of other suspicious activities, it might indicate an attacker verifying their access level or attempting privilege escalation.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, it seems like there's a coordinated effort to delete tasks, modify registry entries, and possibly execute scripts using powershell. These actions could be part of an attack chain—like initial access, lateral movement, data exfiltration, or cleanup. The use of multiple tools and the nature of the commands being executed make this batch of logs stand out as potentially malicious.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this as interesting because the combination of process creations, registry modifications, and deletion activities points towards possible malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: Interesting for Investigation**\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity. Key points include:\n\n1. **Use of schtasks.exe**: Deleting a task named \"spawn\" suggests an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms, common in attacks.\n\n2. **cmd.exe Activities**: Executing REG DELETE commands targets registry entries for removal, often used by attackers to clean traces and avoid detection.\n\n3. **Powershell.exe Usage**: The command line ending with \"& {}\" is unusual and could indicate obfuscation or script execution, a tactic used in attacks.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple RegistryEvent tasks suggest system configuration changes, typical for attackers aiming for persistence or behavior alteration.\n\n5. **Sequence of Tools**: The use of schtasks.exe, cmd.exe, and powershell.exe in quick succession is atypical of normal user activity, indicating a possible attack chain.\n\n6. **whoami.exe Usage**: While not inherently malicious, it could be part of verifying access levels during an attack.\n\nThese factors collectively point towards potential malicious behavior, making this batch of logs worth investigating further."}

Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is the process involved. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and script-based attacks. The fact that it's loading various files like MpOAV.dll and creating temporary scripts (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1) could indicate malicious activity, as attackers often use such techniques to execute code.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are file creations, deletions, and registry modifications. For example, a PowerShell process creates a script in the Temp directory, which is then deleted. This might be an attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself. The registry value sets could be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations to facilitate further attacks.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple instances where cmd.exe and whoami.exe are being executed. Whoami is often used to check user privileges, which attackers might do to escalate privileges or gather information about the system. Using cmd with '\/c' suggests executing a command and then terminating, which could be part of a script trying different commands.\n\nAnother point is that there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads folder. While this might seem normal, if it's unexpected or associated with other suspicious activities, it could indicate logging or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nHowever, some events are generic and might not be malicious on their own. For instance, process creations like conhost.exe are standard for console windows. But combined with the frequency of PowerShell activity, they add to the concern.\n\nThe repeated use of 'powershell.exe & {}' in command lines suggests that these processes are being spawned within a script context, possibly part of a larger attack chain where each command is isolated or chained together to avoid detection.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's clear there's a lot of activity involving PowerShell and other tools commonly used for attacks. The combination of file operations, registry changes, and process spawning points towards potential malicious behavior, such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile each individual event might not be conclusive, the pattern over multiple events is concerning enough to warrant closer investigation. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with associated file and registry activity suggest potential malicious behavior.

First, I notice that a lot of the events involve PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for executing malicious scripts and evading detection.\n\nLooking closer, there are multiple ImageLoad tasks from Windows Defender Platform files like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. This might indicate some legitimate activity, but it's unusual to see so many of them alongside other suspicious actions in PowerShell.\n\nThere's also a file creation event for a PowerShell script test file, followed by its deletion. The fact that the script is created and then immediately deleted could be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nI see several Registry value sets from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome might update its settings normally, multiple registry changes can sometimes signal malicious activity, especially when combined with other indicators.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution stands out too. If this is being run without a clear purpose in the logs, it could be used to gather system information or test user privileges, which are common steps for attackers during lateral movement.\n\nAnother point is the command line arguments for PowerShell.exe, such as \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This script is trying to delete a file in the TEMP directory. The use of ErrorAction Ignore suggests an attempt to suppress errors if the file isn't found, which might be part of cleanup after malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and image loads, along with the whoami.exe execution, indicate potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines that delete files from the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for its scripting capabilities and to avoid detection.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is used to remove specific .zip and .txt files in the TEMP folder. The paths being deleted vary, but they all seem related to some kind of structured data or logs. The fact that multiple files are being deleted suggests a pattern, possibly part of a cleanup routine after malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe loads images and creates files, which could be indicators of script execution or attempts to write to the system. The use of 'Remove-Item' commands with '-ErrorAction Ignore' is concerning because it's a common technique to suppress errors, making it harder to detect such activities.\n\nWhile there are some events from chrome.exe and whoami.exe, these don't seem suspicious on their own. However, the consistent and varied malicious-looking actions in PowerShell commands across multiple entries make this batch worth investigating. The high number of deletions points towards potential data exfiltration or destruction, which are hallmarks of possible security incidents.\n\nI'm also considering if these activities could be legitimate system maintenance, but the specific file names and repeated deletions from TEMP suggest they might not be.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing different files and registry values. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated accesses could be suspicious. However, some of these look like normal operations, especially the loading of system-related DLLs.\n\nThen, I notice a file being created in the Temp directory by powershell.exe: __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1. The same script is later deleted. This might indicate script execution, which could be part of testing or malicious scripting. Also, multiple attempts to remove files from TEMP using different command lines with Remove-Item suggest that someone is trying to clean up traces, possibly indicating they don't want to leave evidence.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run, which might be used by attackers to check user privileges. Additionally, chrome.exe is making several registry changes, which could be normal but might also be part of a persistence mechanism if done in bulk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell processes with file and registry activity, script creation\/deletion, repeated removal attempts from TEMP, and use of whoami.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, meaning each line is a separate JSON object. There are 19 events in total. Looking at the processes involved:\n\n- The first few entries involve 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. That's normal because Chrome might update its settings or extensions.\n- Then there's 'RuntimeBroker.exe', which is related to Windows runtime components, so that's expected too.\n- Next, I see multiple events from 'whoami.exe'. This command usually just returns the current user information and isn't inherently malicious on its own. It could be part of a script checking permissions or something similar.\n- There are several instances where 'powershell.exe' is accessing processes. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so repeated accesses might warrant attention, but in isolation, it's hard to say without more context like command lines or file access.\n- Some events show 'winlogbeat.exe', which I recognize as part of the Elastic Winlogbeat tool, used for shipping logs. A file being created by this process is standard behavior as it collects and stores log data.\n- Finally, there's a file creation event from 'powershell.exe' to 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename doesn't seem suspicious at first glance, but the path might indicate some activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks in each event:\n- Most events are either registry changes or process creations\/accesses. Registry writes could be normal for software updates or configuration changes.\n- File creation by 'winlogbeat.exe' is standard. The PowerShell creating a file isn't unusual unless it's part of malicious script execution.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are multiple instances of potentially suspicious processes (like PowerShell being accessed several times), each individual event doesn't indicate malicious activity. There's no evidence of privilege escalation, known bad indicators, or other red flags. The repeated use of 'whoami.exe' and 'powershell.exe' might be part of a script or legitimate process monitoring.\n\nHowever, the combination could still be concerning because an attacker might use these tools to gather information (like using whoami for credentials) or write malicious scripts that log data. But without more context on how these processes are being used together or any signs of unauthorized access or file modifications beyond creation, it's hard to classify this batch as definitely suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because each event is benign on its own, but the repetition and combination could still be a minor red flag. Maybe if I had more context about the user activity or other logs around the same time, it might change my assessment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and file operations typical of legitimate software behavior.
