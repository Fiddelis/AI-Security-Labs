Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple instances where \"SDXHelper.exe\" is loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems normal since these are system files. But I should check how many times this happensâ€”oh, it's repeated a couple of times, but nothing unusual in terms of paths.\n\nThen, there are events related to user account management without any process or file info. These might be part of regular logon\/logoff activities and probably not suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, I see \"rundll32.exe\" being executed with a command line that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. Rundll32 is commonly used, but the specific parameters need scrutiny. The GUID {9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6} might be associated with legitimate processes, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's part of a known Windows feature or third-party software.\n\nThe \"svchost.exe\" process modifying the registry is another point. SvcHost is used by many services, so this could be normal unless there are signs of unusual activity elsewhere.\n\nThere are multiple entries from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating files in its data directory. This looks like the log shipping tool doing its job, nothing suspicious here.\n\nEXCEL.EXE events loading various DLLs and making DNS queries stand out. Excel is a common application, but why is there so much activity? It loaded several system DLLs, which could be normal if it's running in an environment with many add-ins or macros. The DNS query might be to check online resources or update settings. However, if this is part of a script or automated process, it could indicate data exfiltration.\n\nThe \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" and \"WmiPrvSE.exe\" events are also present. These processes handle Windows features like remote desktop and WMI, respectively. Their activity alone isn't concerning unless there's evidence of unauthorized access or unusual network traffic.\n\nConsidering all these events together, while some actions seem routine, the repeated and varied activities from EXCEL.EXE, especially the DNS query, might warrant closer investigation. It could be normal behavior for an Excel macro accessing online resources, but it could also signal malicious activity if the process isn't expected in this context.\n\nOverall, the batch shows a mix of common and potentially suspicious actions. The confidence level is medium because while some events are concerning, they aren't clearly malicious without additional context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of EXCEL.EXE making DNS queries and loading various system DLLs, which may indicate suspicious activity. Additionally, the presence of rundll32.exe with a specific command line parameter and GUID requires further investigation to determine if it's legitimate or malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's look at each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided five JSONL entries. Each entry represents a security event on Windows. All events are related to the EXCEL.EXE process. That catches my attention because it's unusual for Excel to generate multiple similar logs in quick succession.\n\nLooking at the first two events, they both mention \"File created\" under the rule FileCreate. The file path is pointing to a .LNK file called real_values.csv.LNK located in the Office Recent folder of user fiddelis. This seems suspicious because legitimate Excel usage usually doesn't create shortcut files repeatedly. Creating multiple or several LNK files could indicate attempts to establish persistence or hide malicious activities.\n\nThe next three events are Dns query logs, again from EXCEL.EXE. They don't mention a file path, which is odd for an Excel process since it typically doesn't perform DNS queries unless interacting with external resources. Multiple DNS lookups in a short time might be part of an attempt to communicate with a remote server, possibly for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting this together: multiple instances of the same process creating files and making DNS queries could indicate malicious behavior. This combination is uncommon for normal Excel usage and might suggest that the Excel process is being exploited or used as a vector for an attack.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity beyond these logs. It's possible, though less likely, that this could be a false positive or legitimate but unusual user behavior. Given the nature of the tasks involved (file creation and DNS queries), I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because it shows signs of potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nMy confidence is around 0.8 because while there's strong indication, without more context like actual network communication logs or file contents, it's not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events from EXCEL.EXE showing file creation and DNS queries may indicate suspicious activity such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
