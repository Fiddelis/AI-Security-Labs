Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for scripting and execution. The command line in one event has some suspicious commands: \"findstr\" searching for the word \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc., followed by selecting strings with the pattern \"password\". This looks like an attempt to search for sensitive information, which is a red flag.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event and note any potential red flags or unusual activities.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n\n1. powershell.exe loading a DLL file. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a concern.\n2. A process with a command line that includes \"findstr\" searching for keywords like \"pass\", which might indicate data scraping or password harvesting. This seems suspicious.\n3. svchost.exe modifying the registry. While svchost is a standard system process, it's often used by malware to hide activities, so this could be concerning.\n4. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. This seems normal unless there's something unusual about how it's being used.\n5. findstr.exe being run with specific search parameters, similar to the earlier PowerShell command. Again, searching for sensitive terms might indicate malicious intent.\n\nContinuing through the logs:\n\n- Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing and modifying registry values. This could be part of a script or tool trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations.\n- conhost.exe and other processes also showing registry activity. These are usually legitimate processes, but unusual activities here might warrant attention.\n- Chrome.exe making multiple DNS queries and registry changes. While Chrome is a common application, excessive registry writes could indicate something like adware or tracking software, but it's not necessarily malicious unless there's more context.\n\nOne event stands out: the process where powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This might be an attempt to store data that runs on startup, possibly for persistence.\n\nAlso, the winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file is likely part of log management and probably benign.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch:\n\nThe combination of multiple PowerShell executions with specific command lines, use of findstr to search for sensitive terms, registry modifications by several processes (including svchost), and the creation of files in user-specific directories could indicate malicious activity. These behaviors are common in attack patterns, such as credential harvesting or establishing persistence.\n\nHowever, some events might be part of normal system operations. For example, Calculator.exe loading a DLL is standard. Similarly, Chrome's registry writes could be legitimate updates or tracking components, which aren't necessarily malicious but could raise eyebrows depending on the environment.\n\nThe confidence level here is moderately high because while there are several red flags, not all events are conclusively malicious without more context. But the pattern of behavior—using PowerShell for potentially malicious scripts, searching for sensitive data, and multiple system modifications—points towards something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including Powershell command line with potential credential harvesting, repeated registry modifications, and creation of files in user directories which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, with each line containing a single JSON object. Each object has three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process field sometimes includes a command_line, which gives more context on what the process is doing. The winlog field indicates the type of event, like Image loaded or Network connection detected, and the file field points to any files involved.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. There are multiple entries where chrome.exe loads an image (MpOAV.dll), sets registry values, and establishes network connections. This seems normal for Chrome since it's a web browser that often interacts with external resources and can modify system settings temporarily.\n\n2. Several powershell.exe processes create files in user directories, like downloading 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\n3. There are instances of winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of the logging setup, so this might just be the tool collecting logs and writing configuration files. However, if it's accessing or modifying unexpected files, that could warrant closer look.\n\n4. The whoami.exe process running without any command line arguments seems benign; it's a common system information tool.\n\n5. cmd.exe is used with schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. This can be part of legitimate administrative activities but might also be indicative of malware trying to remove competing malicious tasks or clean up its tracks after execution.\n\n6. schtasks.exe itself is both created and run, sometimes loading taskschd.dll, which is standard for task scheduler operations. However, the command lines show deletion of specific tasks with names like \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". The naming suggests these might be related to some scheduled processes, perhaps part of a malicious payload's persistence mechanisms.\n\n7. svchost.exe modifying registry entries isn't unusual since it's a common system process. But if there are unexpected changes, especially in sensitive areas, that could be concerning.\n\nNow, putting this all together: The presence of multiple schtasks deletions and the use of cmd.exe to remove scheduled tasks is notable. These actions often correlate with attempts to maintain persistence or remove competition, which can be signs of malicious activity. Additionally, the powershell.exe creating files in user directories might be part of script execution, potentially downloading or executing unknown code.\n\nThe high number of events involving process creations and modifications could indicate a sequence of actions that are either part of legitimate system administration or indicative of a threat actor's steps within the system. The combination of these factors makes me lean towards these logs being interesting for further investigation to rule out any malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events is deemed **interesting for investigation** due to several concerning patterns:\n\n1. **Multiple Chrome Activities**: While normal, repeated network connections and registry modifications might warrant monitoring if they deviate from usual user behavior.\n\n2. **Powershell File Creation**: The creation of files by Powershell in user directories could be malicious, especially without clear justification, necessitating further analysis.\n\n3. **Scheduled Task Deletions**: The use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to delete scheduled tasks with specific names suggests potential attempts to remove competition or cover tracks, indicative of possible malware activity.\n\n4. **svchost.exe Registry Changes**: Although common, any unexpected changes could signal malicious behavior, requiring closer examination.\n\n**Conclusion**: These logs exhibit signs that may indicate malicious activities, making them worthy of further investigation to ensure system security and integrity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of events. I'm looking for any signs of malicious activity across all the logs provided.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where powershell.exe is being executed multiple times with different command lines. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers for command execution and script-based attacks. The repeated ProcessCreate events for powershell might indicate an adversary using this tool to perform various tasks.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries involving cmd.exe with specific command-line arguments. For example, one cmd.exe is used to delete the 'notepad.exe' process using wmic. Another cmd.exe instance attempts to delete a user account named \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". These commands could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement techniques. Deleting processes and users might be an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt system operations.\n\nAdditionally, there are several RegistryEvent tasks showing registry value sets and deletions across different executables like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, and whoami.exe. These activities could be related to persistence mechanisms, where attackers modify the system's configuration to ensure their malicious code runs upon system restarts or maintains persistence in the system.\n\nLooking at other processes, schtasks.exe was involved in loading taskschd.dll, which is legitimate, but paired with other suspicious events, it might warrant closer inspection. Similarly, WMIC.exe is used to delete processes, which could be part of process hollowing or to terminate defender-related processes, though not all uses are malicious.\n\nConsidering the volume and variety of these events, they seem coordinated rather than random. The combination of multiple ProcessCreate events for different tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe), registry modifications, and process deletions suggests a potential attack chain. These activities could be part of an attempt to gain access, move laterally, or clean up traces.\n\nGiven the number of potentially malicious actions across different processes, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation. The confidence level is high because while some events are legitimate on their own, together they present a concerning pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated powershell.exe executions, cmd.exe commands to delete users and processes, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system events to see if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and look for any patterns or red flags.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is often related to Remote Desktop Services, but I'm not sure if that's suspicious on its own. Next, there's PowerShell accessing something—maybe legitimate since admins use PowerShell for scripting. The third event is whoami.exe being run, which is a standard command to check user permissions; nothing wrong there.\n\nI notice multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses or creates processes. That could be normal admin activity but might also be a sign of malicious scripts if these are unexpected commands. Then there's an event with no process and User Account Management—maybe a login attempt, which is common.\n\nLooking further, several events show \"Security Group Management\" without a specific process. This seems related to group policy changes, which could be part of regular admin tasks or configuration updates but might also indicate privilege escalation if done from the wrong account.\n\nI spot commands like cmd.exe deleting users with \/del and \/domain. Deleting user accounts can be legitimate for cleanup, but if these are high-privilege accounts or not authorized, it could signal an attack. For example, net.exe and sc.exe are used to delete a user and a service respectively—these commands often require admin access.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe runs \"sc delete win32times\", which removes the Win32Time service. This might disrupt time synchronization, potentially part of a larger attack to compromise system clocks or cause service issues.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances of services.exe modifying registry values. Services often interact with the registry for configuration, but frequent changes could be suspicious if not explained by known updates or patches.\n\nI'm seeing a pattern where several tools (Powershell, cmd.exe, net.exe, sc.exe) are being used in sequence to access and modify system components like user accounts and services. This could be part of an attacker's routine—gaining access, escalating privileges, and then covering tracks by deleting traces or services.\n\nThe high number of registry modifications stands out. While some might be normal, the combination with account deletions and service removals raises concerns about malicious activity aimed at persistence or system compromise.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might seem benign, the batch as a whole shows extensive use of administrative tools for potentially unauthorized actions, including user deletion and service modification. This indicates possible unauthorized access or attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as registry modifications, user deletions, and service removals using administrative tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to analyzing logs for malicious behavior, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event one by one and see what's happening. There are several JSON objects here, each representing an event. The keys in each JSON object are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". \n\nStarting with the first few events:\n1. cmd.exe is running a command to delete some files from the Temp directory. That seems a bit suspicious because deleting files without much context could be malicious.\n2. powershell.exe is accessed, which I know can be used for both good and bad things. PowerShell is powerful but often targeted by attackers.\n3. Another cmd.exe event sets a registry value. Modifying the registry isn't inherently bad, but it's something to watch out for if done unexpectedly.\n\nContinuing through the logs:\n- There are multiple instances where cmd.exe and powershell.exe are being used, which could indicate script execution or malicious activity.\n- I notice some file deletions by cmd.exe, like deleting files from the Temp directory. This is a common tactic in malware to clean up traces of their activities.\n- Then there's whoami.exe running, which usually retrieves user information. On its own, it might not be bad, but if it's part of a larger sequence, it could be used for privilege escalation or info gathering.\n\nLooking further down:\n- There are several events where powershell.exe is being accessed and creates files in the Temp directory. Creating temporary files can be normal, but if they're deleted immediately or have suspicious content, that's concerning.\n- The event where a PowerShell script policy test file is created and then deleted seems odd. It could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies by testing how they work.\n\nI also see multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with powershell.exe commands like \"& {}\", which might indicate the start or stop of PowerShell sessions without much command-line context, making it harder to detect malicious intent.\n\nPutting this all together:\n- The repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe, especially in combination with file deletions and registry modifications, raises red flags.\n- Malware often uses these tools to execute commands, delete evidence, or alter system configurations.\n- The pattern of creating and then deleting files suggests an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if all these actions are malicious. They could be part of legitimate scripts or system operations. But considering the combination—using multiple tools for file deletion and registry changes—it's more likely than not that this batch is indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe, including file deletions in the Temp directory and suspicious script creation\/deletion patterns, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a PowerShell process with a command line that seems to be executing something. The task is 'Engine Lifecycle', which might not be too concerning on its own but could indicate some script execution.\n\nNext, several events show powershell.exe loading different files and creating registry entries. This isn't unusual since PowerShell often interacts with the file system and registry for scripting purposes. However, I should keep an eye out for any signs of malicious activity, like accessing sensitive locations or multiple writes to the same area.\n\nI notice that there are multiple instances where whoami.exe is being executed. Whoami itself isn't harmful, but repeated runs could be part of a script trying to gather user information. Combined with PowerShell, this might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gather environment details.\n\nThere are also entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory. That's normal for log shipping tools like the Elastic Beat family; they often create configuration backups or index files, so I don't see any red flags there.\n\nLooking through the events, several processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe are also accessing registry keys. These are common system processes, so their activity is generally expected unless there's an unusual pattern or access to unexpected locations.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe accessing a file related to Windows Defender, MpClient.dll. This might be part of legitimate script execution but could also be suspicious if it's trying to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nI also see that the same paths and processes are repeated multiple times. For example, whoami.exe is run several times, and powershell.exe accesses the same files repeatedly. While this repetition isn't necessarily malicious, it does raise an eyebrow as attackers often use such patterns to hide their tracks or ensure persistence.\n\nConsidering all these points together: a lot of activity from PowerShell with various legitimate-looking actions, repeated process creations for whoami.exe, normal log file operations by winlogbeat, and some common system processes accessing registry keys. On the surface, it looks like normal script execution and process activity. However, the high frequency of certain events, especially from powershell.exe and whoami.exe, could hint at automated or malicious behavior trying to stay under the radar.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might not be alarming, their combination and repetition over a period suggest possible suspicious activity that warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe interacting with system resources, including file creation, registry modifications, and process access.

Whoami is typically used to check user information, so unless this is part of a script or legitimate process monitoring, multiple runs might warrant attention.\n\nOther processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing the registry could be normal for Windows applications, but unusual activity here could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. Registry modifications are common in malware for creating persistent entries.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe events: there are DNS queries and network connections. While browsing naturally involves these activities, multiple such events without corresponding user interaction might suggest malicious behavior, like a botnet communication or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows varied but potentially concerning activities across different processes. The repetition of certain actions (like multiple powershell.exe accesses) could indicate scripting or automated malicious activity.
