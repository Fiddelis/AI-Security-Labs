The Chrome process has multiple network connections and DNS queries, which seems normal for a browser.\n\nThen there's PowerShell activity: creating processes, accessing registry values, loading various DLLs, and file operations. The command line in one event looks suspicious—it's XORing plaintext with a key and sending data to example.com. This could be obfuscating data transmission, possibly malicious.\n\nThe file created and then deleted also stands out. It might be a script dropped temporarily, which is common in attacks.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL format provided, each line is a separate event. There are several events here, some repeated multiple times. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first few events all have similar command lines in PowerShell. The command_line field shows a script that encodes plaintext using XOR with a key and then sends it via an HTTP POST request to example.com. This seems suspicious because encoding data like this often is used for obfuscation, which is a common tactic in malware or malicious scripts.\n\nAlso, multiple events show the same command-line pattern. Repetition of such exact commands might indicate automated activity or part of a script that's running multiple times, possibly to send data periodically. That could be a sign of data exfiltration, where sensitive information is being sent out from the system.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, many events have tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These seem related to Windows logging components, but when combined with the PowerShell activity, it's worth considering if this could be part of a larger process. Maybe the script is trying to interact with event logs or other system services.\n\nThere are some variations too. One event shows a different task in 'winlog' as 'File created', which might indicate file operations. Another has a file path pointing to MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. It's normal for defender processes to load such DLLs, but when combined with the other PowerShell activity, it could be part of an attempt to hide or manipulate logs.\n\nAnother event shows 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so this might just be part of standard logging setup. However, if this process is running alongside malicious scripts, it could complicate the detection of anomalies.\n\nOne event has a command line that's slightly different but still PowerShell; it shows 'powershell.exe' without any script parameters, which is less concerning on its own but when combined with previous events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe file paths in some events point to DLLs and configuration files. While these could be legitimate system operations, the repeated use of XOR encoding and data transmission stands out as potentially malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple identical PowerShell scripts doing XOR encoding and sending data, variations in log tasks that might indicate attempts to manipulate logging, and a mix of normal and suspicious activities. This combination suggests possible exfiltration or malicious activity trying to hide its tracks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events contains notable signs of potential malicious activity, particularly the repeated use of PowerShell scripts for XOR encoding and data transmission. These actions may indicate an attempt at data exfiltration or obfuscation. Additionally, variations in logging tasks could suggest efforts to manipulate logs. While some activities are benign, the overall pattern raises concern and warrants further investigation.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe log events indicate potential malicious activity, particularly due to repeated PowerShell scripts encoding data and sending it elsewhere. This suggests possible exfiltration or obfuscation attempts, making these events significant for investigation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple identical PowerShell scripts performing XOR encoding and HTTP POST requests suggest suspicious activity such as data exfiltration.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries are from common system processes like Registry value sets and Image loads. These are pretty standard activities on any Windows system, so they might not be suspicious on their own. For example, svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe setting registry values is normal since these services do interact with the registry.\n\nI see several instances where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, in this log, the actions include file creation and accessing processes, which could be part of standard administration tasks or script execution. Without more context on what specific commands were run, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThere are also entries from chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. This might just be Chrome updating its settings or extensions, so that doesn't immediately raise a red flag. The Image loads for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll in various processes are normal as these are system files used by applications to handle URLs and anti-malware scanning respectively.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files seems related to log file management, which is expected behavior from the monitoring tool. There's nothing unusual about that activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they mostly consist of standard operations without any clear indicators of malicious behavior. While powershell.exe could be a concern, the actions logged don't show signs of exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes and activities such as registry value modifications, file creations, and image loads, which are typical on Windows systems. There is no evidence of unusual or malicious behavior in the logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. That immediately stands out because PowerShell can be a common tool but also often used in malicious activities. Each time it's created, I should check the command lines to see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes: \"& {Remove-Item ... -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This looks like a script that's trying to delete files without showing errors. The path being deleted is \"C:\\objeto_temporario\\...\\pacote_padrao_script.bat\". Using Remove-Item with Force could indicate an attempt to remove files that might be protected or hidden.\n\nI also notice there are multiple such events, each deleting different script files from various paths. This pattern suggests a concerted effort to clean up traces of malicious activities, which is common in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion events. Powershell creates a temporary PS1 script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1) and then immediately deletes it. Such behavior is often used by malware to execute commands without leaving behind evidence for long, but since it's deleted right after, it might be harder to detect through static logs alone.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Registry value sets from chrome.exe, which is unusual because Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that way unless something is wrong. But more importantly, this could be an attempt to mask activities or gain persistence in the system. Alternatively, it might not be malicious but still raises a red flag when combined with other suspicious behaviors.\n\nThe multiple RegistryEvent tasks from different processes make me think about potential privilege escalation or attempts to modify system configurations. This could allow for persistent malware or unauthorized access.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with deletion commands and the unusual registry activity from chrome.exe suggest a possible attack. The deletions might be covering tracks after some malicious operation, like dropping files or executing payloads. The fact that these events are spread across different processes (powershell and chrome) could indicate a more sophisticated attack where multiple tools are used to avoid detection.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if the RegistryEvent from chrome.exe is part of normal operations or something else, but combined with the powershell activity, it adds weight to the suspicion. The confidence level isn't 100% because some events might be legitimate, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activities:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activity**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe are created and executed with command lines that delete specific files using `Remove-Item` with `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore`. These commands suggest an attempt to remove files without showing errors, which is a common tactic in malware to erase evidence of malicious operations.\n\n2. **File Deletion**: The deletion targets several script files (e.g., `.bat`, `.ps1`) from various paths. This pattern suggests an effort to clean up traces of prior activities, often seen in attacks aiming to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Registry Events**: Unusual Registry value modifications from chrome.exe could indicate attempts at persistence or privilege escalation, which are common in malware for maintaining access or evading detection.\n\n4. **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion**: Powershell creates a temporary script file and immediately deletes it, a behavior often used by malware to execute commands without leaving long-term traces.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of powershell.exe's suspicious activities, file deletions, and Registry modifications from chrome.exe strongly suggests potential malicious intent. While not conclusive, the pattern points towards an attack involving multiple tools to avoid detection. Therefore, this batch of events is deemed interesting for further investigation.\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe events indicate potential malicious activity due to powershell.exe's deletion commands and unusual registry changes, suggesting a possible attack. The answer is: \\boxed{Yes}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. Each event has process details with command lines that remove specific files using \"Remove-Item\". The paths are varying but follow a pattern like C:\\something\\..\\something_script.bat. This repeated deletion might indicate someone is cleaning up traces of their activity or removing malicious scripts they placed earlier.\n\nThen there are events involving cmd.exe executing sc.exe commands to stop and delete services, specifically 'objeto_temporario' and 'estrutura_secundario'. Using sc.exe like this is a common way to manage services. If these services were created maliciously, stopping and deleting them could be part of an attempt to remove traces or disable monitoring tools.\n\nLooking at the log types, many are related to process creation (Process Create), file operations (FileCreate), registry changes (RegistryEvent), and pipe creations. These activities are typical for both legitimate system administration and potential malicious behavior. The use of multiple commands across different processes makes it harder to pinpoint individual actions as suspicious without context.\n\nThe events also involve other executables like conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and services.exe, which can have legitimate uses but might be part of a larger attack chain if used in combination with the others.\n\nConsidering all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell for file deletions, combined with command-line tools manipulating services, could indicate an adversary trying to remove evidence or disable protective mechanisms. The volume and variety of these activities across multiple processes raise concerns about potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated PowerShell executions attempting to delete specific files, combined with cmd.exe commands to stop and delete services.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event step by step and see if there are any red flags.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice a lot of entries related to 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. These are common tools for both legitimate use and malicious activities, so they don't immediately raise a red flag unless the usage is suspicious.\n\nThe first event involves cmd.exe deleting a file in %temp%. That's a bit concerning because deleting files can be part of an attack to cover tracks. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just a cleanup process someone ran.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The fact that it's accessing registry values might be setting up some kind of persistence mechanism.\n\nThere are also multiple Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. While this is normal for powershell scripts, the specific files loaded don't seem unusual on their own.\n\nI notice a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory by powershell.exe. This could be an attempt to create a temporary script or configuration file that's later removed to avoid detection. It's a common tactic in malware to clean up after themselves.\n\nLooking at the events, there are several entries where powershell.exe is started with \"& {}\". That seems odd because it's not a typical way to invoke powershell. Usually, you'd see commands directly, so this might be an attempt to hide what's being executed or to load modules in a less obvious way.\n\nThere are multiple Provider Lifecycle events as well. These relate to the event tracing providers, which are used for performance monitoring and debugging. Malware sometimes misuse these features, but again, it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nI also see an entry where whoami.exe is run, which could be used by attackers to check user privileges or system information. However, without additional context like unusual access times or multiple failed attempts, this alone isn't suspicious.\n\nThe events involving the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new file might just be part of a log shipping tool's configuration, especially since one of the processes is winlogbeat.exe. This doesn't seem malicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some activities that could be indicative of malicious behavior—like deleting files, accessing registry values, and creating\/deleting temporary files—it's also possible that this is legitimate activity, such as system administration tasks or script execution. The high volume of powershell.exe events, especially with the \"& {}\" command line, stands out a bit, but it's not enough to confidently label the batch as malicious without further analysis.\n\nI think the confidence level here isn't very high because there are plausible legitimate reasons for these activities. However, the combination of several potentially suspicious actions does lean towards possible malicious intent. So, I'd say this is somewhat concerning, but more investigation would be needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits a series of actions that could potentially indicate malicious activity, particularly due to the high volume and nature of powershell.exe usage. However, without additional context or evidence linking these activities to known malicious behavior, it's challenging to definitively classify them as such. The key points of concern include:\n\n1. **File Deletion by cmd.exe**: Deleting files in %temp% could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n2. **Registry Access and Powershell Usage**: Frequent powershell use with suspicious command lines (\"& {}\") may indicate potential malicious intent.\n3. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**: Creating and then deleting files in the Temp directory is a common tactic for hiding malicious activities.\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: These could be part of legitimate debugging or monitoring but are also used by malware.\n\nWhile these actions raise eyebrows, they aren't conclusive proof of malicious intent. Therefore, the batch is considered somewhat concerning but not definitively malicious without further evidence.\n\n**Confidence Level: Low-Medium**\n\nThe events suggest some potential for concern but lack clear indicators of malicious activity. Further investigation would be necessary to determine if these actions are part of an attack or legitimate operations."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being run with various command lines. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note. The commands include creating files, accessing processes, and deleting files in the TEMP directory. For example, I see events where powershell.exe is used to remove a log file in the TEMP folder with the command Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore. This could be an attempt to clean up traces of previous activities, which might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at other entries, there are instances where conhost.exe and whoami.exe are being executed. Conhost is often used in Windows for console applications, but it can sometimes be abused by malware. The use of whoami.exe isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern to gather system information.\n\nI also notice several file operations, like creating files in the StartupProfileData directory and deleting files in the TEMP folder. Creating files could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or dropping malicious payloads. Deleting files might be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nRegistry modifications are another red flag. There are multiple events where registry values are being set. Malware often uses registry keys to achieve persistence, so these changes could be an attempt to ensure the malicious code runs on each system startup.\n\nAdditionally, there's a command using cmd.exe to delete a specific file in the TEMP directory with the \/f, \/q, and \/s flags. These options indicate forcing deletion without confirmation and recursively deleting subdirectories if necessary, which might be used to remove files that are protected or hidden.\n\nPutting this all together, it seems like there's a sequence of events where powershell is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a script or batch process. The combination of file creation, deletion, and registry modifications could indicate that an attacker is attempting to establish persistence on the system, execute malicious commands, and cover their tracks by removing logs or other files.\n\nThe fact that these activities are spread across several events suggests coordinated behavior rather than isolated incidents. While some actions might be legitimate (like using powershell for scripting), the repeated attempts to delete log files and modify registry entries are concerning. This batch shows a pattern that could very well be part of an attack chain, making it relevant for further investigation.\n\nI'm also noting that these events involve multiple processes: powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe. The use of multiple tools might be to bypass certain security measures or detection mechanisms. For example, using both powershell and cmd could be a way to obfuscate the attack vector.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not raise alarms, the cumulative effect suggests potential malicious activity. The combination of file operations, registry changes, and process creations points towards possible compromise indicators. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Repetitive Powershell Usage**: Multiple executions of powershell.exe with commands to delete files (e.g., removing TEMP directory logs) and load modules, which could be part of a script aiming to obscure traces.\n\n2. **File Operations**: Creation of files in sensitive directories like StartupProfileData and deletion of TEMP files using cmd.exe with forceful options, suggesting attempts to remove evidence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Several events show registry value changes, possibly for persistence mechanisms, a common tactic for malware to ensure execution on system restarts.\n\n4. **Tool Abuse**: Use of conhost.exe and whoami.exe, which while legitimate, can be abused by attackers for information gathering or persistence.\n\n5. **Process Coordination**: The sequence of events across different processes indicates a coordinated attack chain, potentially involving multiple tools to bypass detection.\n\n**Conclusion**: These activities collectively suggest possible malicious intent, such as establishing persistence, executing commands, and covering tracks.

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That makes sense because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. So, the fact that it's appearing multiple times could be significant.\n\nLooking at the details, many entries are about image loads from various DLL files. For example, mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. These seem like normal system files related to .NET Framework. But there are also mentions of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's interesting because defender-related modules shouldn't be loaded by a legitimate process unless it's part of some malicious activity.\n\nThen, I see events where a file was created and then deleted in the TEMP directory. The file path is __PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1, which looks like a temporary PowerShell script. Creating and deleting such files can be part of script execution to avoid detection or persistence. The fact that it's being deleted right after creation might suggest an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple entries with the command line argument {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}. This means the PowerShell is trying to delete a file in the TEMP directory, ignoring any errors. Deleting files could be part of cleaning up after malicious activities, so this is a red flag.\n\nThere are also several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events from PowerShell, which are normal when scripts run but might indicate some level of scripting activity that's not typical for standard operations.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry access events. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. The process accessing the registry could be setting up long-term presence on the system.\n\nThere’s also an event where whoami.exe was executed. While this is a common command to check user information, its use alongside other suspicious activities could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances, script creation\/deletion in TEMP, file deletion commands, defender-related DLLs being loaded, and registry modifications. These indicators collectively suggest possible malicious activity such as script execution, data theft, or system compromise.\n\nI'm pretty confident that this batch shows signs of potential malicious behavior, so it's definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events including file creation\/deletion in TEMP, defender DLL loads, and registry modifications, indicating possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}

Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities. The file paths mentioned, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1, seem to point to temporary files. That might indicate some script execution, which could be part of a test or an actual attack.\n\nThere's also a series of events where the command line is 'powershell.exe & {}'. Not sure what that does exactly, but unusual command lines in PowerShell can be red flags. The tasks here are Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, which might relate to how PowerShell initializes.\n\nThen I notice some events involving conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost is typically used as a host for console applications, so not too concerning on its own, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a malicious process. Whoami.exe is commonly used to check user permissions, which attackers might use during reconnaissance.\n\nThere are Registry value set events for both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Changes to the registry can indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that might be part of an attack.\n\nLooking further, there's a file create event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is likely being used here to collect logs, which is normal for monitoring tools, but the path and filename don't immediately raise flags unless it's unexpected in this context.\n\nI also see several Process accessed events related to powershell.exe accessing other processes. This could be indicative of process injection or lateral movement techniques used by attackers.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe with various tasks, creation\/deletion of temporary files, command line anomalies, registry modifications, and the use of whoami.exe for possible user enumeration. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity, possibly a script testing permissions or moving laterally within the system.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks or security tool operations, the combination—especially the repeated powershell.exe events with temporary files and registry changes—tends to align more with attack patterns rather than normal user activity. The confidence level isn't extremely high (maybe around 0.7) because there's no clear evidence of overtly malicious actions like known exploit code or exfiltration, but the indicators are enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe processes with activities such as file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, along with command line anomalies and whoami.exe usage, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
