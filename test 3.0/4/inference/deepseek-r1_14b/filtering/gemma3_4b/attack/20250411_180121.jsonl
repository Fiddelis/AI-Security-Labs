{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm seeing a bunch of events here, mostly from Chrome and PowerShell processes.\n\nFirst off, there are several entries where Chrome.exe is making network connections and DNS queries. That seems pretty normal because browsers do that all the time when you browse the web. No red flags there unless it's accessing known malicious sites, but those URLs aren't shown here.\n\nThen, I notice some PowerShell activity. The first thing that stands out is the command lines. For example, one of them is executing a WebClient to download a file from a GitHub repository into the TEMP directory. That's interesting because downloading files via WebClient isn't typical user behavior and often used in scripts or malicious activities. Also, the fact that it's using raw.githubusercontent.com suggests they might be trying to fetch some code or script.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of FileCreate and FileDelete events related to PowerShell scripts in the TEMP folder. This is a bit concerning because creating and then deleting files quickly can be a tactic used by malware to avoid detection. Plus, these files have names like __PSScriptPolicyTest followed by random strings, which doesn't look legitimate.\n\nAnother point is the repeated Registry value sets from PowerShell. Modifying the registry isn't inherently bad, but combined with other actions, it could indicate persistence mechanisms where attackers try to maintain access to a system over reboots.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for .NET framework DLLs, which again seems normal for PowerShell execution, but when combined with other behaviors, it's worth noting.\n\nI'm also seeing multiple Provider Lifecycle events from PowerShell. I'm not exactly sure what that entails without more context, but it might be related to how PowerShell is initializing or managing its modules.\n\nPutting this all together: There are multiple instances of downloading files via WebClient into the TEMP directory and deleting them afterward, along with registry modifications. These behaviors could indicate script execution, potentially malicious in nature. The repeated attempts to download from different GitHub repositories (modulo_temporario, unidade_base, etc.) might suggest an automated process or a botnet activity.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact purpose of these scripts, it's hard to say definitively. But given that they involve downloading files and modifying system settings via PowerShell, there is a higher chance of malicious intent than standard user activity.\n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting because it shows potentially malicious script execution patterns, even though some actions are common but in combination they raise suspicions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events indicating potential script execution and file downloads from GitHub repositories.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I notice multiple entries where PowerShell is being used with command lines that download files from GitHub repositories. That's a red flag because downloading files from unknown sources can indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere are three instances where powershell.exe is executing commands to download files into the TEMP directory. The URLs point to different branches and files on GitHub, which seems unusual for typical PowerShell use. This could be part of an attack or payload delivery.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where Chrome is making registry changes. While some registry activity is normal, multiple entries might suggest an attempt to modify system configurations, possibly to maintain persistence or change settings maliciously.\n\nI also see other activities like file creations and network connections. For example, MpDefenderCoreService.exe detecting a network connection could be part of security monitoring, but combined with the earlier suspicious PowerShell commands, it adds concern. There's also activity from winlogbeat.exe, which might be legitimate if it's an ELK component, but the repeated FileCreate tasks are worth noting.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple PowerShell downloads and unusual registry modifications across different processes suggests potential malicious behavior. This batch definitely warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories into temporary directories, which may indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a cybersecurity perspective. The user wants me to analyze all these JSONL entries as a whole and decide if they're interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one to see what's happening. \n\nThe first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because calc.exe might need some system files to run. But then again, sometimes malicious processes can disguise themselves as common ones. I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware. The fact that it's modifying the registry could be suspicious, especially if it's happening multiple times.\n\nLooking further, Calculator.exe also loads urlmon.dll. That might be another red flag since legitimate apps don't usually need to load such system files unless they're doing something more complex. Maybe it's a coincidence or part of some legitimate operation?\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe instances accessing processes and modifying the registry. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The repeated process accesses could be an indication of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nI notice that cmd.exe is being used with commands like SCHTASKS to delete tasks and REG DELETE to remove entries from the registry. These are signs of someone trying to clean up their tracks. Malware often does this to remove traces of its activity, so that's concerning.\n\nThe use of schtasks.exe to delete scheduled tasks adds more weight to the idea that something is amiss. Attackers might schedule malicious tasks and then delete them if they're detected, or perhaps they're trying to disrupt normal system operations.\n\nThere are events where reg.exe is used to delete registry entries, specifically from HKCU. This again points towards an attempt to modify user-specific settings, possibly to maintain persistence or remove evidence of their presence on the system.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple processes accessing and modifying the registry, deleting scheduled tasks, using command-line tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe in a way that suggests cleaning up after some activity. These are classic indicators of potential malicious behavior.\n\nThe repeated use of svchost.exe for registry modifications stands out because while it's a legitimate process, it's commonly used by malware to hide their activities. The combination with other events like process creation of whoami.exe and conhost.exe accessing the registry also raises suspicions.\n\nFurthermore, the command-line arguments show specific actions like deleting registry entries named \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". These names don't ring any bells as legitimate system processes, which makes me think they're created by malicious actors to hide their tools or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe fact that these events are spread across multiple instances of different processes suggests a coordinated effort. It looks like someone is trying to cover their tracks comprehensively, perhaps during an attack or post-attack cleanup phase.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows signs of potential malicious activity: registry manipulation, process creation with specific commands, deletion of scheduled tasks, and attempts to remove traces from the system. These are not typical user activities but rather behaviors often associated with cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of processes accessing and modifying the registry, using command-line tools in suspicious ways, and attempting to delete system tasks and entries, which are indicative of potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's look through each event carefully.\n\nThe first few events mention powershell.exe being accessed or used with Provider Lifecycle tasks. That alone isn't unusual since PowerShell is a common tool. However, the command line seems suspicious—it's 'powershell.exe & {}', which might be an attempt to execute commands in a way that could be obfuscating something.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe is creating files in temporary directories, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. This file is created and then deleted shortly after. That behavior could indicate script execution or testing of policies, which might not be malicious but could also be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks.\n\nAnother point is the repeated loading of various DLLs by powershell.exe. While PowerShell does load many libraries, especially when running scripts, some of these paths, like those related to .NET andclr.dll, might be normal. But I should check if any of them are unusual or associated with known malicious activities.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That could be part of legitimate PowerShell profile initialization, but it might also be used for persistence mechanisms if the script runs on startup.\n\nLooking at other processes like conhost.exe accessing registry values—conhost.exe is typically related to console windows, so this seems a bit odd. Maybe it's unrelated or part of a legitimate process, but it could warrant closer examination.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there are several red flags: repeated powershell.exe usage with unusual command lines, file creation and deletion in temp directories, and other activities that might be trying to hide something. While not all events by themselves are malicious, the combination suggests possible suspicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with unusual command lines and file operations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: whoami.exe is being run with the command line pointing to its usual Windows directory. The task is Process Create, which makes sense because it's starting a new process. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's powershell.exe accessed via Process Access. Powershell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye out for more events related to it.\n\nThen another command line: cmd.exe with the \/c flag. That usually means executing a command and then exiting. The task is Process Create again, so maybe someone is running some batch commands through CMD.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe accessing registry values and performing process accesses. Registry modifications can be tricky because they might indicate persistence mechanisms or changes to system configurations.\n\nI also notice that cmd.exe is setting registry values a couple times. Could this be part of a script or automated process?\n\nThere's an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is often used in Windows for console applications, but seeing it modifying the registry might be worth looking into more.\n\nThen there are several instances where powershell.exe is creating and then deleting files quickly. The file created is __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1, which seems like a temporary script file. Powershell often uses such files when executing scripts. The fact that it's created and then deleted shortly after might be part of the process to test script execution policies.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from processes with command lines pointing to powershell.exe. I'm not entirely sure what this indicates, but it could be related to service or event provider registration.\n\nLooking at the image load events, they all point to different system DLLs and some Microsoft .NET framework components. This seems normal when Powershell loads its environment and libraries.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a lot of activity around Powershell and CMD, which are commonly used by both legitimate scripts and attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious commands. The creation and deletion of temporary script files could indicate that someone is testing the system's policy enforcement against script execution, possibly trying to bypass restrictions.\n\nThe repeated registry access and modifications might be an attempt to maintain persistence or change system settings to facilitate further attacks. Also, the use of multiple processes (whoami.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe) along with Powershell could be part of a larger campaign where different tools are used at various stages.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, it does seem like there's potential malicious activity here. The combination of Powershell script execution attempts, registry modifications, and temporary file handling raises red flags about possible attacks or attempted policy circumvention.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits signs that may indicate potential malicious activity, warranting closer investigation from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Powershell Activity:** Multiple entries show Powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, which can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious purposes.\n2. **Temporary Script File Handling:** The creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary script file suggests possible attempts to execute scripts that could bypass policy enforcement.\n3. **Registry Modifications:** Several events involve modifying the registry, potentially indicating efforts to maintain persistence or alter system configurations for malicious intent.\n4. **Use of CMD and Other Tools:** Activities involving cmd.exe and conhost.exe may be part of a broader campaign using various tools for different stages of an attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combined activities, including script execution attempts, registry modifications, and the use of multiple processes, raise concerns about potential malicious intent. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these activities and determine if they pose a threat."}

First, I'll go through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, I notice that both 'Calculator.exe' and 'powershell.exe' are involved in various tasks like setting registry values and creating pipes. PowerShell is known for being a versatile tool, but it's also commonly used in malicious activities because of its scripting capabilities. The fact that there are multiple events from powershell.exe doing different things might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further down, I see 'chrome.exe' has several entries where it's setting registry values. That's unusual because Chrome doesn't typically interact with the registry in such a way unless something is wrong or maybe being manipulated by another process.\n\nThen there are events involving 'conhost.exe' and 'whoami.exe'. Conhost is often associated with command-line tools, but seeing it set registry values could be concerning. The 'whoami.exe' running without any suspicious arguments seems less likely to be malicious on its own, but in combination with other actions, it might warrant attention.\n\nThe later entries show powershell.exe accessing processes and loading various DLLs. This kind of activity can indicate script execution or module loading, which could be part of legitimate operations but also a sign of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe across multiple events with tasks like setting registry values, creating pipes, and accessing other processes stands out. These actions are often seen in persistence mechanisms or lateral movement techniques used by attackers. The involvement of other legitimate processes like chrome.exe being manipulated could indicate a broader attack where multiple tools are being abused.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be part of normal operations (like loading DLLs), the sheer number and combination of events involving powershell.exe performing potentially malicious tasks make this batch worth investigating further. There's a high confidence that this activity isn't benign, especially considering the use of known attack vectors like registry modifications and process access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious activities such as setting registry values, creating pipes, accessing processes, and loading DLLs.

Temporary files created by scripts can be a red flag, especially if they're being deleted right after creation. The deletion commands in the PowerShell command lines (like Remove-Item) suggest that someone might be trying to clean up evidence.\n\nThere are multiple instances of file deletions from the TEMP folder, each with different filenames. This pattern could indicate an attempt to remove logs or malicious files. Also, the use of \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" is a common tactic in malware to suppress error messages, making it harder to detect issues.\n\nAnother point is the registry changes made by both PowerShell and Chrome.exe. While Chrome can make registry adjustments for its operation, unexpected or multiple registry modifications might be suspicious, especially if they're not typical user actions.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe running as a process isn't inherently malicious, but when combined with other PowerShell activities, it could be part of reconnaissance to gather system information.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the consistent use of PowerShell for file operations and deletions, coupled with attempts to suppress errors and modify system configurations, suggests potential malicious activity.

That seems standard too since Windows processes often interact with the registry.\n\nNext, there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating new files. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a tool attackers might use. The frequency here could be suspicious, especially if these accesses aren't part of normal operations.\n\nThe whoami.exe process creations stand out because they're often used to check user permissions or identity.
