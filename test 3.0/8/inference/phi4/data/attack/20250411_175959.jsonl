PowerShell is repeatedly used for command execution and file creation, which could be indicative of script-based attacks. The presence of suspicious processes like 'net1.exe' (a common typo in malicious activities) and unusual use of 'cmdkey.exe' suggests possible credential dumping or manipulation attempts.
