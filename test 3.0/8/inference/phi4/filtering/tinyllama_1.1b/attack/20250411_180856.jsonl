These include repeated network connections from chrome.exe, which could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command and control server. Multiple registry value set operations by powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe are common in malware for persistence or configuration changes. WMIC.exe loading critical system files such as amsi.dll (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) and MpClient.dll could suggest attempts to evade detection. The repeated process access events by powershell.exe may indicate an enumeration of sensitive processes or escalation of privileges.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
