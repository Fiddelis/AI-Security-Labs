Notably, there is evidence of dynamic code generation and execution using `csc.exe` to compile C# source files into executables, followed by the loading and execution of these compiled binaries (`tarefa_auxiliar.exe`, `unidade_padrao.exe`). Additionally, PowerShell and CMD are used for complex operations including process access, registry modifications, and executing scripts or commands. These behaviors can be associated with malware trying to evade detection while performing potentially harmful actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
