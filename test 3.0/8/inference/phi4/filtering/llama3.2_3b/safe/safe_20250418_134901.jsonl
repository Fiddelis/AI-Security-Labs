Each entry contains information about processes running on a computer, Windows logging events, and file-related activities. Here's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. **Process Information**:\n   - Includes details such as `name` of the executable (e.g., `notepad.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `winlogbeat.exe`, etc.).\n   - Some entries have `null` for process, indicating no specific process was associated with the event.\n\n2. **Winlog Events**:\n   - Describes Windows events or tasks being tracked.\n   - Examples include \"Process Create\", \"Image loaded\", \"Dns query\", and \"User Account Management\".\n   - Each task has a rule identifier (e.g., `rule: ProcessCreate`).\n\n3. **File Information**:\n   - Contains file paths related to certain events, such as DLL files being loaded (`urlmon.dll`, `taskschd.dll`) or files being created (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`).\n   - Some entries have `null` for the file, indicating no specific file activity was recorded.\n\nThe JSON data is formatted to be machine-readable and could be used by security information and event management (SIEM) systems, log analysis tools, or IT monitoring solutions. It helps in tracking system activities, identifying potential security incidents, and auditing user actions on a computer network."}
