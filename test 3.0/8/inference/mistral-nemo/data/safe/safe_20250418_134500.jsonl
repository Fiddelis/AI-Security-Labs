{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows event log data, here's a breakdown of the activity that occurred:\n\n1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Process and Image Load Events:**\n   - A process named `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was created.\n   - The process accessed other processes and loaded images (dlls) from its directory located at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate`.\n     - `msedgeupdate.dll` was loaded multiple times.\n     - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` itself was also reloaded once.\n   - The process made network connections, suggesting it was communicating with external resources.\n\n2. **Termination of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:**\n   - After a series of image loads and network connection detections, the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process terminated three times in quick succession.\n\n3. **Registry Value Set by RuntimeBroker.exe:**\n   - The process `RuntimeBroker.exe` set a registry value, but no further details are provided about what was changed or where it was set.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Process Creation and Activity:**\n   - A new process named `winlogbeat.exe` was created from the download directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64`.\n   - The process loaded its own image (i.e., itself).\n   - It accessed other processes and created a new file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`. This suggests that winlogbeat started writing its logs to this new file.\n\nThese events collectively suggest that Microsoft Edge Update service was active, communicating externally, and then terminated. Additionally, a new process related to log collection (Winlogbeat) was started and began writing logs to a new file."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows event log data, here's a summary of notable events:\n\n1. **Process Creations:**\n   - `svchost.exe`: Created multiple times.\n     - It created files in `C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\Cache`.\n     - These files are related to Microsoft's Delivery Optimization service used for Windows updates and app delivery.\n   - `Explorer.EXE`: A registry value was set, likely due to a user interaction or software installation.\n   - `notepad.exe`: Opened with no command line arguments (empty).\n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:\n     - Created a file in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download\\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}\\135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`.\n     - Deleted a temporary file in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`.\n     - Created and updated a temporary setup file in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\setup.exe`.\n   - `CompatTelRunner.exe`: A process related to compatibility telemetry, created due to a Dns query.\n   - `MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`: Created after the update file was downloaded and prepared for installation.\n   - `setup.exe`: Created as part of Microsoft Edge installation process.\n\n2. **File Creations:**\n   - Multiple files created in DeliveryOptimization cache folder by `svchost.exe`.\n   - Temporary files related to Microsoft Edge update and installation.\n   - `WindowsUpdate.etl` file created in `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate`.\n\n3. **Pipe Created:**\n   - A pipe was created, which is often associated with inter-process communication (IPC).\n\n4. **Registry Value Set:**\n   - `Explorer.EXE` set a registry value, indicating user interaction or software installation.\n\n5. **winlogbeat.exe**:\n   - This is related to Elastic's logging agent for Windows. It created a new `.yml.new` configuration file in the Downloads folder of the user `fiddelis`.\n\nThese events suggest regular system and software updates, particularly with Microsoft Edge, along with standard system activities like process creations and file manipulations. There doesn't appear to be any suspicious or malicious activity based on this data alone. However, it's always a good idea to monitor such logs regularly for any unusual patterns or outliers."}
