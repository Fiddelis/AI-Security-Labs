Each instance created a new version of the `officeaicopilot-strings.min` file with a unique hash.\n\nHere are a few examples of the subsequent events:\n\n1. A new file was created with the hash `4091ebb427771cbae3cfbb9d0093889a`.\n2. Another new file was created with the hash `4304ae23123a85eeca93a99e1e7d2f98`.\n3. Yet another new file was created with the hash `4373659712197c87940ed09943dda3ad`.\n\n**Implications:**\n- It seems that the process `SDXHelper.exe` is generating and replacing multiple versions of the `officeaicopilot-strings.min` file over time.\n- The cause for these frequent replacements or generations is not specified in the logs. It could be due to updates, errors, or normal operation, depending on the context.\n- Since all the events are related to the creation of a specific type of file by the same process, it might indicate that `SDXHelper.exe` is performing some kind of string processing or updating task related to Office applications.\n\nTo better understand why these frequent replacements\/creations occur, you would need to look into the logs before and after these events or consult with the application's developers\/documentation."}

You could try manually updating both through their respective control panels in Windows, or via the Office application itself (File > Account > Update Options).\n\n5. **File Permissions**: The user account might not have the necessary permissions to create or modify files in that directory. Check the file permissions for the directory and files.\n\nTo diagnose further, you could enable logging for the Office application and the add-in itself (if it's custom) to see if there are any specific error messages being thrown when this issue occurs.
