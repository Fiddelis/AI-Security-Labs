This is unusual and could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or commands.\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - A file named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1' was created and deleted within a short period in the 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp' directory, which is typical behavior for temporary PowerShell scripts.\n   - Another file ('StartupProfileData-NonInteractive') was created in the PowerShell directory, suggesting possible tampering with startup profiles.\n\n3. **Whoami.exe Executions**: There are multiple 'whoami.exe' processes being created. While this could be normal user activity, the timing and proximity to the PowerShell events raise suspicion.\n\n4. **Registry Changes**: A registry value was set by PowerShell.exe, which could indicate attempted persistence or configuration change."}
