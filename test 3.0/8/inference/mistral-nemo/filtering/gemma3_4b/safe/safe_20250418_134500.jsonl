This could be normal behavior, but it's worth monitoring for any unusual activity.\n\n```json\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"svchost.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\ServiceProfiles\\\\NetworkService\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\DeliveryOptimization\\\\Cache\\\\0119e1000c0b37d7bf0cbfcf99429ea7a6b906fb\"}}\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"svchost.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\ServiceProfiles\\\\NetworkService\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\DeliveryOptimization\\\\Cache\\\\0119e1000c0b37d7bf0cbfcf99429ea7a6b906fb\\\\content.phf\"}}\n```\n\n2. **Registry Value Set**\n   - `Explorer.EXE` set a registry value.\n\n```json\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"Explorer.EXE\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":null}\n```\n\n3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**\n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` created and then deleted an executable file in the temp folder.\n   - It then created a setup.exe file in the install directory, which is typical for software installations.\n   - A pipe was created by `setup.exe`.\n\n```json\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\{4BB03C95-201D-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"}}\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\{4BB03C95-201D-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"}}\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft\\\\EdgeUpdate\\\\Install\\\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\\\setup.exe\"}}\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File creation time changed (rule: FileCreateTime)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft\\\\EdgeUpdate\\\\Install\\\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\\\setup.exe\"}}\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"setup.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\"},\"file\":null}\n```\n\nWhile these events might be normal for Microsoft Edge updates, it's essential to monitor any further activities to ensure they align with typical update behaviors.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Installation**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` created a new `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file in the Downloads folder. This could indicate an attempted installation of Winlogbeat, which is used for log shipping in Elastic Stack.\n\n```json\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x64\\\\winlogbeat.exe\"}}\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\f.dell\\\\Documents\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x64\\\\config\\\\winlogbeat.yml.new\"}}}\n```\n\nTo maintain a secure environment, keep an eye on the following:\n\n- Monitor any changes in the DeliveryOptimization cache folder.\n- Keep track of registry modifications made by Explorer.exe or other processes.\n- Ensure that Microsoft Edge update activities align with typical behaviors and do not indicate any suspicious activity.\n- Verify if the attempted installation of Winlogbeat was successful and authorized."}
