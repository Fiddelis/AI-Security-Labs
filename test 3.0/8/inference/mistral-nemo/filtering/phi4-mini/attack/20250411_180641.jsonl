A powershell process accesses another process, followed by multiple network connection detected events from chrome.exe. Then, cmd.exe is used to compile and execute csc.exe with potentially malicious files as inputs. Afterwards, multiple image loaded events occur with various system DLLs being loaded into unknown executables. Finally, registry values are set repeatedly by various processes, which could indicate attempts at persisting changes. The involvement of powershell, network connections, and unknown executables makes this batch relevant for investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
