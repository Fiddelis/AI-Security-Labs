Here's a summary of the issue:\n\n1. **Duplicate Files**: The files are named using a hash-based approach (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`), but they're being duplicated, as seen in entries like:\n   ```\n   officeaicopilot-strings.min_bcde561ecb8a682661d626d5bf33668b.js\n   officeaicopilot-strings.min_bcde561ecb8a682661d626d5bf33668b.js\n   ```\n\n2. **Process Involved**: The process causing this issue is \"SDXHelper.exe\", which is likely related to Microsoft Office.\n\nTo resolve or investigate the issue, you could:\n\n1. **Check for Conflicting Processes**: Ensure that there aren't any conflicting processes running that might be causing file duplication.\n2. **Inspect Office Applications**: Check if there are any issues with your Microsoft Office applications, as this problem seems to involve their solution packages.\n3. **Review Antivirus\/Antimalware Software**: Sometimes, antivirus or antimalware software can cause false positives and lead to file duplication. Review your security software settings.\n4. **Contact Technical Support**: If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft's technical support for further assistance."}

However, the constant creation and deletion of 'officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js' files by `SDXHelper.exe` might indicate an issue with Office Application Add-ins, which could potentially impact system performance.\n\nTo resolve the issue with `SDXHelper.exe`, consider the following steps:\n1. Check if any recently installed Office Application Add-ins are causing the high CPU usage or other issues.\n2. If possible, temporarily disable the suspected add-ins to observe if the constant file creation and deletion stops.\n3. Consider reaching out to Microsoft Support or contacting your system administrator for further assistance if the issue persists.\n4.
