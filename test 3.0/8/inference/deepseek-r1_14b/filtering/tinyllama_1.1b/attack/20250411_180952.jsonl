{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is from MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That seems normal since it's part of the antivirus service.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing DNS queries and network connections. Chrome regularly does these activities when browsing, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen I notice several cmd.exe processes running commands to add users and groups in the domain. Specifically, adding \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password and adding \"modulo_comum_Admin\" to Domain Admins. This stands out because creating new domain admins is a high privilege action and could indicate potential privilege escalation or unauthorized access.\n\nThere's also a powershell.exe process setting registry values. Powershell is commonly used for malicious activities, so this adds concern, especially when combined with the cmd activity.\n\nAnother event shows conhost.exe modifying registry values. Conhost is often associated with command-line tools and can be used maliciously to execute commands without being easily detected in the taskbar.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation by powershell.exe of \"pacote_base.txt\" in a user directory. Creating files in user directories isn't inherently bad, but combined with other events, it raises suspicion.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries creating temporary logs are normal as svchost is part of Windows services and often writes to such logs.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple high-privilege commands via cmd.exe and powershell.exe, creating new domain admins, modifying registry values, and file creation in user directories. These activities could be signs of a potential compromise or insider activity. The confidence level is around 0.8 because while some actions are suspicious, they might also be legitimate admin tasks, but the volume and specific commands lean towards malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple high-privilege process creations (cmd.exe and powershell.exe) performing domain administrative actions, such as adding users to Domain Admins group and modifying registry values.
