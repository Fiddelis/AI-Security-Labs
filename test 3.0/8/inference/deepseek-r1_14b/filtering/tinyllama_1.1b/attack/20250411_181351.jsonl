Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is \"whoami.exe\" being executed. That's a common system utility used to get user information, but sometimes attackers might use it to check permissions or user context, so that could be worth noting.\n\nNext up are several events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is powerful and often misused for malicious activities. The tasks here include Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image Load, Provider Lifecycle, and Engine Lifecycle. These actions can indicate script execution or configuration changes. There's also a command line that shows Add-Type in System.Windows.Forms, which suggests screen capture functionality. That seems suspicious because screen capturing could be part of data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where the same PowerShell commands are run with different filenames being saved to the TEMP directory. This repetition might indicate an attempt to create files for persistence or to drop malicious scripts.\n\nThere's a File Created event in the TEMP folder, which is often used by malware to store configuration files or payloads. Another File Created event refers to a StartupProfileData file, which might be related to non-interactive PowerShell profilesâ€”something attackers could use for persistence.\n\nOther events involve Calculator.exe and chrome.exe accessing the registry. While legitimate applications do access the registry, repeated writes could indicate tampering with system configurations or attempts to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious activities like screen capture code, file creation in TEMP, and registry modifications. These behaviors are often associated with malicious scripts aiming to maintain persistence, gather information, or prepare for further attacks. The combination suggests potential lateral movement or exfiltration attempts.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the activities don't seem normal for typical user behavior and align with common attack vectors like using PowerShell for scripting and persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications, image loading, screen capture attempts, and file creation in the TEMP directory. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So I'm given a batch of four JSONL events related to the Chrome process on Windows. Each event has details about the process name, Windows log task, and possibly a file path.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. First event: The process is chrome.exe, the task is \"Registry value set\", and there's no file involved.\n2. Second event: Again, chrome.exe, task is \"Image loaded\", and the file path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll.\n3. Third event: Chrome.exe once more, task is \"Image loaded\", and the file is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender Platform... MpOAV.dll.\n4. Fourth event: Back to registry value set with no file.\n\nSo, I need to analyze these events as a whole batch to decide if they're interesting for investigation or not. \n\nFirst, let's break down what each task means. \"Registry value set\" usually indicates that something is modifying the Windows Registry. In Chrome.exe's case, this might be normal because legitimate software often writes to the registry during operation.\n\nNext, \"Image loaded\" events mean that a DLL file was loaded by the process. The two files here are amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. \n\n- Amsi.dll is part of Windows Antimalware Scan Interface. It's a known system file and usually not malicious.\n- MpOAV.dll belongs to Windows Defender, specifically its OAV engine for scanning. Again, this is legitimate.\n\nSo all the files involved are standard system files. Chrome.exe loading these DLLs seems normal as part of its operation or in conjunction with security features.\n\nNow, considering all events together: two registry writes and two image loads. Since both tasks (registry and file operations) are common for a running process like Chrome, especially when interacting with known system components, there's nothing here that stands out as malicious or suspicious.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise, such as loading from unusual paths, accessing restricted areas, or multiple writes to the same registry key. The combination doesn't create an unusual pattern either; it all fits within normal process behavior for Chrome when interacting with standard Windows components.\n\nTherefore, this batch is likely not interesting for further investigation because all activities are within expected parameters of a legitimate application's operation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operations of the Chrome process loading legitimate system files and interacting with the registry, which is typical behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
