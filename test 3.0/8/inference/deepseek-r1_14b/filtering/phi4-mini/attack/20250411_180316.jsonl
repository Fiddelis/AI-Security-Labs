{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of processes being logged. The first few entries are RuntimeBroker.exe setting registry values. That seems normal since Windows services often interact with the registry.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be a vector for attacks. However, in this case, it's just marked as \"Process accessed,\" which might not be suspicious on its own yet.\n\nNext, svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. Svchost is a common process for services, so again, that's normal unless there's something else indicating malicious activity.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—that sounds odd. Why would Calculator load a DLL associated with URL handling? Maybe it's legitimate because some system processes do this, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user directory for winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems related to log shipping or monitoring tools, which might be part of normal operations if the system uses ELK stack or similar.\n\nWhoami.exe being executed without any command line—this is a basic system info tool. Usually harmless, but it could be used by attackers to check privileges. But alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nAnother powershell.exe process access. Still, nothing concrete about its actions yet.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry values again—another standard Windows process.\n\nThen Calculator.exe sets a registry value. Hmm, maybe it's part of some legitimate functionality, but I'm not sure.\n\nMultiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. This repetition is notable because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution or persistence. The sheer number could be a red flag, indicating possible script activity trying to avoid detection by using different methods each time.\n\nLooking further down, there's a cmd.exe process with the command line \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That looks suspicious because WMIC is often used in remote attacks or for deleting processes. The fact that it's being called from cmd and uses a WMI query to delete Notepad.exe could indicate an attempt to terminate something running, possibly malicious activity.\n\nThen another powershell.exe accessing, followed by cmd.exe setting registry values—this alternation between command-line tools is a bit concerning. It might be part of an attack chain where different tools are used at various stages.\n\nWMIC.exe being executed with the command line \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\"—again, another attempt to delete Notepad.exe via WMI. This repetition suggests that someone or something is trying hard to terminate this process, which could be part of an infection trying to remove competition or cover tracks.\n\nLooking at the file loads for WMIC.exe into various DLLs—MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender is legitimate, but also other system DLLs like urlmon and amsi. It's unclear if this is normal or part of a malicious payload.\n\nNotepad.exe being set in registry—maybe it's being used as part of an exploit or persistence mechanism. If Notepad.exe was running earlier, maybe it was executed with some malicious script.\n\nFinally, more cmd.exe and chrome.exe setting registry values, but nothing else stands out immediately.\n\nPutting this together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, repeated attempts to delete Notepad.exe via WMIC, and several registry modifications. These are all indicators that could point towards potential malicious activity. While some events might be part of legitimate operations, the combination raises suspicion about possible attack vectors or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the log events, the batch exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activities:\n\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Activity**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes could indicate an attacker using PowerShell for command execution or persistence.\n\n2. **WMIC Commands**: Several cmd.exe and WMIC.exe commands attempting to delete Notepad.exe suggest efforts to terminate a process, possibly to remove competition or cover tracks, which is concerning.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Numerous registry value modifications by various processes, including svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, and others, could be part of an attack chain for persistence or configuration changes.\n\n4. **Suspicious File Loads**: WMIC.exe loading DLLs from unexpected locations might indicate the use of legitimate tools in malicious ways or attempts to deploy payloads.\n\n5. **Notepad.exe Involvement**: The repeated mention of Notepad.exe being set in registry and targeted by deletion commands raises suspicions about its role, possibly as part of an exploit.\n\nIn conclusion, while some activities may seem benign, the combination of these events suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent or an ongoing attack. Further investigation is warranted to assess the nature of these processes and their impact on system security."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of Windows event logs here, each line being a JSON object with process info, winlog task, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from different processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, conhost.exe, schtasks.exe, and svchost.exe. Each of these is doing various tasks: creating processes, accessing or setting registry values, loading images, etc.\n\nI remember that some of these processes can be legitimate but might also be used maliciously. For example, powershell.exe is often used by attackers for command execution because it's a powerful scripting tool. cmd.exe and schtasks.exe are also common tools that could be part of malicious activities like scheduling tasks or executing commands.\n\nLooking at the specific events:\n- There are several \"Registry value set\" tasks from chrome.exe and others. Modifying the registry isn't inherently bad, but repeated changes might indicate tampering.\n- The schtasks.exe command line shows deleting a task: \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". Deleting scheduled tasks can be part of hiding malicious activities or preventing them from being detected.\n- cmd.exe is used to copy and overwrite files like sethc.exe, which could be replacing legitimate system tools with malicious ones. That's a red flag because altering system binaries often indicates malware.\n- There are multiple instances where processes are created (Process Create events). Powershell and cmd.exe being called repeatedly might suggest automated or script-based activity, possibly from an attacker.\n\nI should consider if the combination of these activities could indicate something malicious. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with commands that modify system files and registry settings is concerning. Also, deleting scheduled tasks can be a way to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nHowever, I need to assess whether this level of activity is unusual enough to warrant investigation. While some actions like using chrome.exe for registry changes might seem odd, it's possible in certain legitimate scenarios (like extensions or updates). But the combination with powershell and cmd activities that modify system files and registry points towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the volume and types of events suggest a pattern that could be indicative of an attack. The confidence isn't super high, maybe around 0.7, but there are enough red flags to merit closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities, including registry modifications and deletions of scheduled tasks, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where different processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, and powershell.exe are accessing the registry or creating processes. Notably, whoami.exe is being executed without any unusual command-line arguments, which doesn't immediately raise a red flag but could be part of normal user activity.\n\nThen, I notice several instances where powershell.exe is involved in various tasks like Registry value sets, Process accesses, and Image loads. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly abused by attackers for executing malicious scripts or commands. The fact that there are multiple events related to powershell.exe accessing the registry and creating files might indicate potential suspicious activity.\n\nLooking closer, I see that a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 was created and then deleted by powershell.exe. This behavior could be part of script execution testing or an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving a trace for long. Temporary files being created and immediately deleted can sometimes be a sign of trying to hide activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where the command line for powershell.exe is \"& {}\", which seems unusual. Typically, you'd see a script name after \"&\", so this might suggest that the command was executed in a way that's not straightforward or could be part of obfuscation techniques.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the logs. These events can relate to how PowerShell starts up or shuts down, but their frequency and combination with other activities might warrant closer examination.\n\nI also notice that winlogbeat.exe created a configuration file. This seems normal unless it's part of some malicious activity mimicking log collection tools, but there's no evidence here suggesting tampering with logs.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple powershell.exe instances accessing the registry, creating and deleting temporary files, unusual command-line arguments, and repeated process accesses—I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting. The pattern suggests potential malicious behavior or at least something out of the ordinary that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the registry and creating\/deleting temporary files, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell can be a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware often uses it to execute commands or download additional tools.\n\nThe first few events show powershell.exe loading different DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll, which might seem normal, but the repeated instances could indicate some automated process or script execution. Then there are events where files are created in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is a common location for malicious scripts to drop files temporarily.\n\nI notice several registry value sets by powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts. Also, the repeated \"Process accessed\" events on powershell.exe might suggest lateral movement within the system, where an attacker is trying to access other processes.\n\nThe command lines in some events are using if statements with Test-Path commands checking for specific .bat files. This could be a way to ensure certain conditions are met before executing malicious code. It's also worth noting that these checks exit either 0 or 1 based on the file existence, which is a common technique used by scripts to avoid detection.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks in winlog. These might be part of loading custom providers or modules, which could be related to加载恶意模块或进行其他非法操作。此外，powershell.exe被多次调用，并且每个事件都执行不同的任务，这可能表明正在运行一个复杂的脚本或者多个相关脚本。\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell.exe invocations, file and registry modifications, process accesses, and conditional checks on external files suggests potential malicious activity. These behaviors don't seem to align with standard user activities or legitimate system operations. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n\nI'm confident about this assessment because each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, but the pattern of repeated powershell.exe usage and associated file\/registry interactions over multiple events raises concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe processes with various activities including file creation, registry modifications, and image loading.

PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be a red flag for malicious activities because it has powerful command execution capabilities.\n\nLooking at the tasks:\n- File Delete logged: This could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or alter logs.\n- File created events in specific temporary directories like C:\\Users\\...\\\\Temp and Downloads might suggest file creation as part of malicious activity, perhaps writing files to disk for later use.\n- Registry value sets are common in persistence mechanisms; attackers often modify the registry to maintain access or ensure their scripts run at startup.\n\nThere's a series of events from 'chrome.exe' with registry writes. While Chrome can make such changes normally, multiple identical registry writes could be suspicious, possibly indicating an attempt to manipulate system configurations.\n\nThe command lines for powershell.exe look complex and obfuscated:\n- The command lines use '& {if (Test-Path ...)' which is a common way to execute commands conditionally. If the specified file exists, it exits with 0; else, it proceeds.\n- Obfuscating paths or using '..\\\\' could be an attempt to hide the true location of files, making it harder to trace.\n\nThe creation of .bat scripts in various locations (e.g., modulo_ativo, modulo_logico) suggests potential script execution. These scripts might contain malicious commands, like 'dir', which is innocent on its own but could be part of a larger payload.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe are normal for script execution, but the specific DLLs loaded, like MpClient.dll and MpOAV.dll, relate to Windows Defender. This might not be suspicious on its own unless they're being used maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- The combination of file deletions, registry modifications, file creations in temporary directories, and obfuscated command lines points towards potential malicious activity.\n- Multiple instances of powershell.exe with varied activities indicate possible script execution for different purposes, which could be part of a broader attack campaign.\n- The repeated registry writes from chrome.exe are unusual and worth investigating as they might not align with standard Chrome behavior.\n\nI'm confident that these events collectively show signs of potential malicious activity, so I'd classify this batch as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell, including file creation in temporary directories, registry modifications, and obfuscated command lines.

This is concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Creating new scripts could be setting up persistence or malicious tasks.\n\nNext, there are events where a file is created and then immediately deleted. That's a red flag because attackers might delete logs to cover their tracks.\n\nThere are pipe creations too. These can be used for communication between processes, which might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nLooking at the Registry events, multiple writes to the registry could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or install persistent malware.\n\nThen there's conhost.exe accessing the registry and powershell.exe checking if a script exists before exiting. This could be part of a stager ensuring certain conditions are met before executing malicious code.\n\nThe image loaded events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clrjit.dll are related to .NET, which is normal for PowerShell.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes running with command lines that check for the existence of various .bat files using Test-Path. Each event seems to be checking a different path structure, but the pattern is repetitive. This repetition makes me think it's part of a script or batch file execution, maybe testing if certain files exist.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell creates and deletes temporary files in the user's AppData directory. For example, creating __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1 and then deleting it shortly after. This is a common technique used by scripts to test permissions or policies because they can create and delete files quickly without being detected easily.\n\nLooking further, there are events where other processes like whoami.exe are run. However, these seem less concerning on their own since whoami is a legitimate system command often used for user identification.\n\nAnother thing I see is the creation of configuration files by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads folder. That's expected if that tool is running and setting up its data collection.\n\nI also notice some registry accesses and process access events from PowerShell, which are normal as part of script execution but could indicate malicious activity depending on what they're accessing.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of Test-Path in PowerShell suggests potential file presence testing, which is often a sign of malicious behavior trying to check if certain files or tools are already present before proceeding. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of evading detection mechanisms, like avoiding persistence by not leaving permanent traces.\n\nWhile these actions aren't conclusive proof of an attack, they do exhibit behaviors that are commonly associated with malware or scripts attempting to remain undetected.

This kind of behavior can be common in scripts, but it might also indicate something malicious trying to check if certain binaries exist before proceeding.\n\nThere are events where PowerShell is creating temporary files, like the .ssp.ps1 script, which was then deleted. Creating and deleting temp files quickly can sometimes be a sign of bad actors trying to avoid detection or clean up after themselves.\n\nI see several instances where different executables (whoami.exe, cmd.exe) are being called with specific command lines. The cmd.exe line looks suspicious because it's checking for a file named objeto_logico.txt in the temp directory and exiting if it exists. This could be part of a larger script trying to determine whether certain conditions are met before executing further actions.\n\nThe repeated Registry value sets and process accesses might be attempts to modify system configurations or gather information, which is often what malicious software does to persist or escalate privileges.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern of multiple PowerShell instances with varied command lines, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and checks for specific files could indicate a potential attack.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where `whoami.exe` is being executed. This is a common system utility used to display user information, so on its own, it's not necessarily suspicious unless it's run in an unusual context or combined with other activities.\n\nNext, I notice that `powershell.exe` is being accessed several times. PowerShell can be used both for legitimate administrative tasks and for malicious scripts. The command lines in some events show conditional checks using `Test-Path`, which might indicate attempts to verify the presence of certain files. This could be part of a script checking if specific files exist before proceeding, which raises some red flags because it's often used by attackers to ensure their tools are present or to check for indicators that they've been detected.\n\nLooking deeper into the command lines, some have long paths with repeated patterns and placeholders like `elemento_base`, `estrutura_auxiliar`, etc. These might suggest that the script is trying different file locations, possibly attempting to bypass detection by checking multiple potential infection points. This behavior could be part of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to spread across the system.\n\nThere's also an event where a PowerShell script creates and then deletes a temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`). This is concerning because creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic used by malware to avoid detection. It might indicate that the script is attempting to bypass certain policy checks or simply cleaning up after itself to leave fewer traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to registry accesses and image loading, which could be part of how the malicious process is trying to hide or establish persistence in the system. The repeated use of `powershell.exe` with varying command lines suggests a possible script that's iterating through different configurations or targets, which is a behavior often seen in attacks.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the execution of `whoami`, multiple PowerShell invocations with conditional checks on various file paths, temporary file creation and deletion, and registry interactions—it seems like there could be malicious activity. While each individual event might not be alarming, the combination suggests a potential attack vector or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm also thinking about how attackers often use legitimate tools in their arsenal to blend in with normal traffic. Using `whoami` and PowerShell is a common tactic because they're standard utilities, making it harder for defenders to spot anomalies. The varied file paths being checked might be part of an attempt to compromise different parts of the system or other machines on the network.\n\nIn summary, while each event alone isn't necessarily malicious, the pattern of behavior across multiple events raises concerns about potential unauthorized access, script execution, and possible data exfiltration or system compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity. Key points include:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions**: The frequent use of `powershell.exe` with conditional checks on various file paths suggests a script attempting to verify the presence of specific files, possibly indicating an attack or persistence mechanism.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**: The creation and immediate deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) may be an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms, a common tactic in malware.\n\n3. **Registry Access and Image Loading**: These activities could be part of establishing persistence or hiding malicious processes within the system.\n\n4. **Use of `whoami.exe`**: While not inherently suspicious, its execution might complement other activities to gather system information during an attack.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of these events suggests a potential security threat, warranting further investigation and monitoring for any signs of compromise or unauthorized access."}

Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. However, it can also be legitimate for system administration tasks, so context matters.\n\nLooking at the actions:\n\n1. The first event shows Image loaded (MpClient.dll). Defender-related files are usually benign, but sometimes they're loaded by malicious processes to check behavior.\n2. Next, a File created under the user's AppData directory. That could be suspicious because scripts in such locations might not always be welcome.\n3. Registry value set and Process access events indicate that powershell.exe is interacting with system configurations, which can be part of both legitimate scripting or malicious activities.\n4. There are multiple instances where whoami.exe runs. This is often used to check user privileges, so if it's part of a larger script execution, it might be a sign of privilege escalation.\n5. The command lines in several events contain checks for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. That script name suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is definitely malicious behavior when found on a system.\n\nThe repeated attempts to check and exit based on the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 could indicate that an attacker is trying to execute this script but ensuring it doesn't already exist to avoid detection or duplication. The fact that multiple events are checking different paths for this file suggests persistence attempts across various locations, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe batch also includes several FileCreate and ImageLoad events related to temporary files and known Defender files. While these aren't overtly malicious on their own, the combination with the script checks makes it more concerning. The deletion of the __PSScriptPolicyTest file could be an attempt to clean up traces after execution or during payload delivery.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the repeated use of powershell.exe for potentially malicious scripts, the attempts to execute a known keystroke logger, and the persistence mechanisms across multiple directories make this batch quite concerning. It's not just isolated events but a pattern that suggests an active attempt at unauthorized system access or data theft.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes:**\n   - The majority of events involve `powershell.exe`, which is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, making it a key focus area.\n\n2. **Analyze Event Types:**\n   - **Image Load Events:** These load various DLLs like `mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll`, which are part of .NET Framework and typically benign but can be indicators if loaded by malicious processes.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** The creation and subsequent deletion of temporary files (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) could indicate script execution attempts or cleanup routines to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Inspect Command Lines:**\n   - Command lines show repeated checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across different paths, suggesting an attempt to execute this malicious script which is known for capturing keystrokes.\n   - The use of `whoami.exe` in some events indicates potential privilege escalation or user information gathering.\n\n4. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - Multiple events checking for the same script in various locations suggest a deliberate effort to ensure the script isn't already present, possibly to avoid detection or to maintain persistence across different directories.\n\n5. **Consider Context and Timing:**\n   - The frequency and variety of operations (file creation, image loading, registry access) under the same process indicate a concerted effort rather than random events, raising suspicion of coordinated malicious activity.\n\n6. **Assess Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - The presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a known IoC for malicious scripts aiming to capture sensitive information.\n   - Use of powershell.exe with such script execution attempts aligns with common attack vectors like persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.\n\n7. **Evaluate Risk:**\n   - Considering the combination of process activity, file operations, and known malicious script indicators, this batch represents a high risk of compromise or attack in progress.\n\n**Conclusion:** The events indicate potential malicious activities involving powershell.exe to execute a keystroke logger and persistence mechanisms across multiple directories, making them highly concerning from a cybersecurity standpoint."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The presence of several powershell processes is notable. Looking closer, some of these have command lines checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files. For example, one line checks if \"C:\\tarefa_temporario\\componente_padrao\\entrada_geral\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" exists and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. Another does a similar check in a different directory. This behavior could be part of a script checking its components are present, which might indicate some form of persistence or malicious activity.\n\nThen there's an instance where winlogbeat.exe is creating files. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so seeing it create configuration files isn't unusual on its own. However, the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\" seems a bit off. It's possible this is part of a legitimate update or installation process, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are several registry access events from various processes like powershell.exe and notepad.exe. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often set or change registry values to persistence their malware. The fact that multiple processes are doing this adds some concern.\n\nLooking at the network activities, chrome.exe has multiple Network connection and Dns query events. While Chrome is known for making many connections, the frequency here seems high. Could this be related to data exfiltration? It's possible, but it could also just be normal browsing behavior, especially if the user is on a site-heavy activity.\n\nThere are a couple of process creations: whoami.exe and calc.exe. Whoami is typically harmless, used to get user info, so that doesn't raise flags. Calc.exe might seem innocuous, but sometimes attackers rename malicious tools to appear benign, though in this case, it's just the built-in calculator.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe accessing different processes and registry entries. This could be indicative of a script or tool trying to gather information or establish persistence. The multiple ProcessAccess events suggest that powershell is interacting with other processes, which might be part of legitimate administration tasks but could also signal malicious behavior like lateral movement.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events are from svchost.exe, which is a common process name for system services. However, in this case, it's modifying the registry and making network connections. Since svchost can host various services, these actions alone aren't suspicious unless combined with other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs that could indicate malicious activity: powershell script checks, repeated process accesses,registry modifications, and network connections. However, some of these activities might be part of legitimate processes or misconfigured scripts. Without additional context like timestamps, user accounts involved, or specific file hashes, it's challenging to definitively conclude malice.\n\nOn the other hand, if this were a red team\/blue team exercise, such activity would be expected during an attack simulation. But in a real-world scenario, these signs could warrant further investigation, especially focusing on the powershell scripts and their origins.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs presents several points that could indicate potential malicious activity or misconfigurations:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activities**: The multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that check for specific .ps1 files are concerning. These actions might be part of a script checking its components, possibly indicating persistence or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Registry access by various processes like powershell.exe and notepad.exe raises flags since attackers often use registry modifications for persistence.\n\n3. **Network Connections from Chrome.exe**: The high frequency of network connections and DNS queries from chrome.exe could hint at data exfiltration, though it might also be normal browsing behavior.\n\n4. **Process Creations**: While whoami.exe is benign, the repeated process accesses by powershell.exe could signal lateral movement or malicious activity.\n\n5. **svchost.exe Actions**: The registry modifications and network connections from svchost.exe, while not definitive, could warrant closer inspection as svchost can host various services.\n\n**Conclusion**: These signs suggest a need for further investigation, especially focusing on the powershell scripts' origins and their activities. Without additional context, it's advisable to monitor these processes closely or conduct a deeper forensic analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, looking at the logs, I see a lot of entries from powershell.exe. That catches my eye because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware often uses it to hide its tracks or execute commands.\n\nLooking closer, there are several events where powershell.exe is creating files in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1 was created and then immediately deleted. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the command lines in some of these powershell.exe processes look odd. They have commands like \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\", which are PowerShell cmdlets for listing items recursively. But seeing them together with \"& { ... }\" makes me think it's executing a script or multiple commands, possibly to gather information about the system or files.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is accessing the registry (Registry value set) and loading various DLLs, includingclr.dll and mscoree.dll. These actions can be part of normal operations, but when combined with other activities like file creation\/deletion in temp folders, it raises concerns about potential malicious behavior.\n\nAnother point is that some events mention \"Pipe Created\". Malicious scripts might use pipes to communicate with other processes or to hide their activity, so this could be a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe with similar command lines. Repetitive identical commands might indicate automation or a script running multiple times, which could be part of a larger campaign or malicious process.\n\nOn the other hand, some events seem normal, like the creation of a configuration file for winlogbeat.exe, which is likely a log management tool. But since most of the entries are related to powershell.exe with potentially suspicious activities, it's hard to overlook those.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating\/deleting temporary files, odd command-line arguments, registry accesses, and multiple process creations points towards possible malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in temp directories, repeated odd command-line arguments, registry accesses, and pipe creations indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is from powershell.exe creating a file named estrutura_secundario.txt in the user's Downloads folder. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag because attackers sometimes use it for scripting malicious activities. So this could be suspicious, but I need to consider more context.\n\nNext up is winlogbeat.exe creating another file. Winlogbeat is an agent typically used for collecting and sending logs to Elasticsearch. It's part of the ELK stack, so seeing its activity is normal unless there's something unusual about how it's being used here. The file path seems standard for a configuration file update.\n\nThe third event again involves powershell.exe but this time it's setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate system administration, but they're also common in malware to persistence or modify system settings maliciously. This adds some concern because scripts modifying the registry might be trying to establish persistence.\n\nLastly, another powershell.exe event where it accessed a process. Process access events can indicate legitimate activity like debugging or legitimate scripting, but again, in the context of multiple PowerShell activities, it's worth monitoring. attackers often use such accesses for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nPutting this all together: two events from powershell.exe doing different things (file creation and registry modification), plus a process access event. These could be indicators of script-based attacks or APTs that leverage legitimate tools for malicious purposes. The fact that they're multiple actions in quick succession by the same process is concerning, suggesting possible lateral movement or payload execution.\n\nOn the other hand, winlogbeat's activity is benign and doesn't add much to the suspicion unless it's being misused. But since the main focus seems to be on powershell.exe activities, which are more likely to be malicious in such a combination, I think this batch is indeed interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe performing actions like file creation, registry modification, and process access suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
