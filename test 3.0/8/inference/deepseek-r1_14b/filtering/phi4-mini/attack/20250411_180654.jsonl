{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these events collectively and decide if they merit further investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of activity involving powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to pay attention to how it's being used here.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe creating a file called 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. That's interesting because creating files can be part of data collection or persistence mechanisms. Next, there are multiple events where chrome.exe is setting registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings and extensions, repeated writes could indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not related to normal browser operations.\n\nThen I see an event where whoami.exe is run, which is typically used to get system information. This isn't inherently malicious but can be part of lateral movement or credential dumping in attacks.\n\nLooking further, there are several powershell.exe processes being created with command lines that execute a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that this script is named 'Get-Keystrokes' suggests it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is a clear indicator of malicious activity—keyloggers are often used for surveillance and data theft.\n\nThe script paths vary slightly each time: different directories like 'tarefa_base', 'modulo_ativo', etc., but they all point to Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition might be an attempt to avoid detection by varying file locations, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe loads various .NET framework components and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. While the former is normal for script execution, the latter could indicate efforts to bypass antivirus software or execute malicious code undetected.\n\nAnother point of interest is that after creating a temporary file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1', powershell.exe immediately deletes it. This behavior suggests an attempt to evade detection by leaving minimal traces, which is typical in APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) or sophisticated malware.\n\nTaking all these events together: the repeated use of powershell with potentially malicious scripts, registry modifications that could alter system configurations, and efforts to delete evidence point towards a coordinated attack. The varied script paths might indicate multiple attempts or different stages of an attack, possibly using multiple techniques to ensure persistence and avoid detection.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities align with normal user behavior. While some powershell usage is common for system admins, the specific scripts involved (Get-Keystrokes), coupled with deletion of temporary files, suggests malicious intent rather than legitimate activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch of events shows signs of potential malicious activity involving persistence, data collection, and attempts to avoid detection. It's definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits characteristics indicative of malicious activity, including the use of powershell.exe for executing potentially harmful scripts, registry modifications by chrome.exe, and efforts to delete evidence. These actions suggest a coordinated attack, possibly involving keylogging and persistence techniques. Therefore, this batch is deemed **interesting** and warrants further investigation.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Interesting}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening here.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key sometimes contains details like command_line or name, which tells us what executable is running. Winlog gives information about the task or event type, and file provides a path if there's a file involved.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that reference Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. This script name sounds suspicious because it suggests keylogging activity. Keyloggers are often used for malicious purposes to capture keystrokes and gather sensitive information like passwords.\n\n2. The second event shows Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) from a legitimate Windows Defender file, MpClient.dll. That's normal, so not too concerning on its own.\n\n3. Next, another Image load but this time urlmon.dll is loaded by powershell.exe. URLMON is part of the Windows shell and used for handling URLs, which in itself isn't malicious, but combined with other activities might be a red flag.\n\n4. Then there's a File created event under PowerShell's StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. That seems unusual because I'm not sure why non-interactive profiles would create files during script execution, especially when dealing with something like keylogging.\n\n5. There are several Registry value set events by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities to maintain persistence or change system configurations without user consent.\n\n6. Looking further down, there's a process called winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used for collecting Windows logs, which seems benign unless it's being misused here.\n\n7. There are multiple File created events by svchost.exe pointing to the same keyValueLKG.dat file under different service profiles. Svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, but if it's creating files abnormally, especially in non-standard locations or with unusual names, that could indicate something's off.\n\n8. Lastly, there are several powershell.exe events creating files in user Downloads directories, which might be part of the malicious script dropping additional files or logs from keylogging activities.\n\nPutting this all together: The repeated use of PowerShell to execute scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Keyloggers are tools often used by attackers to steal sensitive information. The combination of these events—executing such scripts, modifying the registry, and creating files in unusual locations—raises suspicions that this could be part of an attack. While some individual actions might not look suspicious on their own, the pattern suggests a coordinated effort that likely warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including PowerShell execution of scripts named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' (possibly keyloggers), registry modifications, and file creation in unusual locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
