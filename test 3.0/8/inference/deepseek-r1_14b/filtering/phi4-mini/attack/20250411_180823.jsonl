{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. The user is asking me to analyze all these events together and decide if they're interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first three events are from chrome.exe with network connection detected and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity.\n2. Then there's powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that might be a red flag.\n3. Next, calc.exe loading an image—this by itself isn't suspicious unless it's being executed in an unusual way or with other events.\n4. svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is part of Windows services, but sometimes malware uses it. Multiple registry changes could indicate something's up.\n5. cmd.exe is running a command to create scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe on logon and startup. Creating tasks at logon or startup can be malicious if the task isn't legitimate.\n6. schtasks.exe creating more scheduled tasks pointing to cmd.exe and calc.exe. Schtasks is for scheduling, but repeated use with commands like this might indicate persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n7. Calculator.exe loading an image—again, not suspicious on its own unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n8-9: svchost.exe continues setting registry values, which could be normal or malicious.\n10-13: More schtasks.exe events creating scheduled tasks. This seems repetitive and could be a sign of persistence.\n14-15: cmd.exe again modifying the registry and creating files in Task folder. Malware often creates scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.\n16-17: conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe also setting registry values, which is unusual unless they're part of legitimate processes, but it's worth noting.\n18-20: Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and other processes modifying the registry again. This could be normal system activity, but the volume might suggest something else.\n\nPutting all this together, I notice a lot of scheduled tasks being created by schtasks.exe and cmd.exe pointing to calc.exe. Using calc.exe as part of malicious activities is common because it's a benign process, making it easier to hide malicious actions. The repeated use of powershell.exe and svchost.exe with registry modifications could indicate installation of persistent malware components.\n\nThe batch shows multiple processes creating tasks on startup or logon events, which are classic indicators of potential malicious activity aiming for persistence across reboots or user sessions. The fact that several different executables (cmd.exe, schtasks.exe) are being used to create these tasks adds to the suspicion.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming, the combination—especially the creation of multiple scheduled tasks executing calc.exe on key system events—points towards potential malicious behavior worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities indicative of possible malicious behavior, including repeated use of schtasks.exe and cmd.exe to create persistent scheduled tasks, registry modifications by non-standard processes, and unusual activity involving potentially harmful executables.\",\n  \"detailed_findings\": {\n    \"abnormal_process_activity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Processes such as powershell.exe, svchost.exe, conhost.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are performing registry modifications which may be outside their normal operational parameters.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"event_id\": 4,\n          \"process_name\": \"powershell.exe\",\n          \"task_type\": \"Registry value set\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"event_id\": 7,\n          \"process_name\": \"svchost.exe\",\n          \"task_type\": \"Registry value set\"\n        },\n        \/\/ ... more events\n      ]\n    },\n    \"scheduled_task_creations\": {\n      \"description\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks are being created using schtasks.exe and cmd.exe, which may indicate attempts to establish persistence.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"event_id\": 5,\n          \"process_name\": \"cmd.exe\",\n          \"task_command\": \"schtasks \/create\"\n        },\n        \/\/ ... more events\n      ]\n    },\n    \"execution_of_calculation_tool\": {\n      \"description\": \"calc.exe is being executed in a potentially suspicious manner through scheduled tasks, which could be indicative of malicious intent.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"event_id\": 5,\n          \"process_name\": \"cmd.exe\",\n          \"command\": \"start calc.exe\"\n        },\n        \/\/ ... more events\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"conclusion\": \"The observed activities suggest potential malicious behavior, particularly concerning the use of system tools for persistence and unauthorized registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries from chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot—like eight or nine times. Usually, legitimate applications do modify the registry, but such repetitive activity could be a red flag. Malware often manipulates the registry to hide itself or alter system configurations.\n\nThen, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory. While this might be part of its normal operation, I'm a bit cautious because sometimes malicious tools create files in unexpected places, especially if they're trying to persist across reboots.\n\nLooking further, chrome.exe loads some DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are known legitimate system files, so that's probably not an issue. But it's worth noting any attempts to load unusual libraries could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe creates a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, so creating files can be part of normal operations, but it's something to watch. Additionally, there are multiple ProcessAccess events from powershell.exe, which could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement if not properly authorized.\n\nLastly, whoami.exe was executed with a standard command line. While whoami is generally benign and used for system information, in some contexts, especially with different parameters, it can be part of more malicious activities like reconnaissance.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, and the use of whoami.exe might indicate potential malicious behavior. However, each individual action could also be legitimate, especially from Chrome and Windows utilities. The high frequency of registry writes from a single process is concerning but not definitive on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, file creation by winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe creating a file, and whoami.exe execution suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
