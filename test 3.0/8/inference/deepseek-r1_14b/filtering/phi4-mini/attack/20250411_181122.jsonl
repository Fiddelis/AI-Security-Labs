{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice several instances where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The command line includes a script that searches for patterns related to 'pass' in various file types like .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls. This immediately raises a red flag because such scripts are often used to search for sensitive information or credentials, which could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a process creation event for whoami.exe, which is typically harmless but can be part of privilege escalation if executed in the wrong context. However, when paired with powershell.exe activities, it might be worth looking into.\n\nI see multiple events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads various image files. While these are normal operations for PowerShell scripts, the combination with the file searching script makes me cautious. Additionally, there's a file creation and deletion of a temporary .ps1 script in the user's Temp directory. Creating and then deleting a script file can be an attempt to hide malicious activity, so this is concerning.\n\nAnother point is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks associated with powershell.exe instances. This could indicate that the process is being monitored or controlled externally, which might not be standard behavior.\n\nThere are also events related to notepad.exe accessing registry values, but without more context, it's harder to assess if this is suspicious.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple invocations of powershell.exe with potentially malicious scripts, temporary file creation\/deletion, and repeated process monitoring. These behaviors collectively suggest possible unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines searching for sensitive patterns, along with associated file operations and registry interactions indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because svchost is a known process for services.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—nothing suspicious there since it's a common system file.\n\nThen findstr.exe being used with command line arguments searching for \"pass\" in various files. Searching for the word \"password\" might be normal or could indicate something malicious, but on its own, it's not conclusive.\n\nOfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query is standard behavior; it likely connects to Microsoft services.\n\nPowershell executing some script: The command line has findstr searching for passwords and then using select-string. This seems like it's trying to extract password info, which could be malicious. Also, the powershell process creating files and modifying registry values might be setting up persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThere are multiple events of conhost.exe and other processes accessing the registry—normal activity but could also be part of malicious behavior if combined with other actions.\n\nChrome.exe has a lot of entries: pipe creation, DNS queries, loading system DLLs. But also network connections. While Chrome can do these things normally, the frequency here seems high. Maybe it's being used for something like cryptojacking or data exfiltration.\n\nThe last few events show winlogbeat creating files and chrome accessing Defender components—could be normal or part of a process trying to hide its tracks.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch has multiple signs that could indicate malicious activity, especially the powershell script searching for passwords and the unusual number of registry changes. However, some of these actions can also be legitimate. Since there are several red flags but no concrete evidence, I'm on the fence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events that could indicate potential malicious activity, such as unusual process creations (findstr.exe with specific arguments), powershell executions, and repeated registry modifications. These activities may suggest a compromise or suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe creating a file named \"objeto_logico.txt\". PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for malicious purposes, so that catches my attention. Then there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit odd because Chrome usually doesn't make many registry changes on its own, especially if it's happening multiple times.\n\nNext, another file creation by powershell.exe for \"estrutura_ativo.txt\". So now we've seen two files created by PowerShell in the same directory. This is concerning as attackers might use this to store malicious scripts or data.\n\nThen there's a process access event from winlogbeat.exe. That's a legitimate tool for log management, so maybe not suspicious on its own. However, I should keep an eye out if it's accessing something unusual.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution isn't too worrying since it's often used to check user permissions, but the command line is just the default path, which seems normal. Another process access by PowerShell again—this repetition might indicate some automated activity.\n\nLooking at schtasks.exe being used with delete commands for specific task names. That's interesting because deleting tasks can be part of persistence mechanisms. Task Scheduler deletions often happen to remove malicious scripts or to hide traces. The command lines show they're deleting specific tasks, which could be an attempt to clean up after some activity.\n\nSVCHOST.exe modifying the registry—this is a common process and not inherently suspicious, but when combined with other events, it might indicate something more. The fact that it's paired with schtasks deletions makes me think there's a pattern here.\n\nAnother whoami.exe execution and more PowerShell process accesses. This repetition suggests a possible script running multiple times or part of a larger campaign.\n\nThere's also cmd.exe setting registry values and executing a command to delete notepad.exe processes using WMIC. Using WMIC for process deletion is a technique often seen in malware because it bypasses certain security features. Combining this with the earlier schtasks deletions points towards potential malicious activity aimed at persistence or cleanup.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of deleting tasks, accessing and modifying registry entries, using PowerShell to create files, and employing WMIC for process deletion—all these actions are red flags for possible malicious behavior. They seem coordinated and indicate someone trying to maintain persistence or cover their tracks. The variety of tools used (PowerShell, schtasks, cmd.exe, WMIC) further suggests a sophisticated approach, which is concerning.\n\nSo overall, the batch shows several suspicious activities that together paint a picture of potential threats. Therefore, it's definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes, schtasks.exe deleting scheduled tasks, and cmd.exe executing commands to delete processes via WMIC. These activities may indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are being used with commands that look like they're deleting users. For example, there are lines like \"cmd.exe \/c net user \/del...\" which suggests someone is trying to delete user accounts. That's a red flag because unauthorized account deletions can be part of malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are several events where the same processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe) access registry values and create new processes. The repeated use of these commands might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or hide traces, which is common in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, I see WMIC.exe loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. While WMIC is legitimate, it's often abused by attackers to execute malicious code remotely. The fact that it's loading these specific files could be an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms or inject malicious code.\n\nLooking at the timestamps would help, but since they're not provided, I have to rely on the frequency and nature of the events. The repetitive pattern of using command-line tools for user deletions and system access makes me suspicious of potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities don't align with normal user behavior. They seem like a coordinated effort that could be part of an attack chain—initial breach, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and cleanup. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of user deletion commands executed through cmd.exe and net.exe, which could indicate unauthorized account removal or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: cmd.exe, powershell.exe, services.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe are all running. That's a mix of system utilities and some that can be used for scripting or malicious purposes.\n\nOne of the events has cmd.exe deleting something related to 'win32times' using sc delete. I remember that SC is a tool for managing Windows services, so deleting a service might be legitimate administrative work or part of malware trying to hide traces. It's a bit concerning but not conclusive on its own.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry multiple times. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers because it can do a lot, including execute scripts and modify system configurations. The fact that it's accessed several times without any file operations might be normal admin work or could indicate malicious activity like lateral movement.\n\nThere are several entries where services.exe is accessing the registry. Services.exe is part of Windows and handles service-related tasks, so this could be legitimate. However, repeated registry modifications can also be a sign of configuration changes made by malware to persistence points.\n\nI see cmd.exe deleting files in the temp directory, specifically 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe'. Deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but if these files were created maliciously, it might be an attempt to clean up evidence. The command line suggests they're using del with some parameters, which could be part of a script.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved in provider lifecycle events and image loads related to .NET components. This seems like normal operation for PowerShell when executing scripts or commands that involve managed code. However, the repeated ImageLoad events might indicate something more, but without seeing the actual script, it's hard to tell.\n\nI also notice some cmd.exe processes modifying registry values, which could be part of a larger script trying to change system configurations or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of process creation for utilities like cmd.exe and powershell.exe, deletion of files, registry modifications across different processes. It seems like there's a pattern of system changes that might not be typical user activity. The use of sc delete on a service, the file deletions in temp folders, and repeated registry changes could all point towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, without more context—like timestamps to check for unusual timing or seeing what these scripts are actually doing—it's hard to be certain. But given the combination of actions that can be part of lateral movement, persistence, or cleanup steps in an attack chain, this batch is definitely something to look into further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of process creations and deletions involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and services.exe.

So, first, I see a lot of events from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts. But in many environments, it's also a legitimate tool, so that doesn't automatically make it suspicious.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged: there are Image loads, File creates, Deletes, Pipe Created, Engine Lifecycle, Process Create, Process Access events. Some files being created and then deleted could be part of some script execution or testing. The file paths like Temporary folders suggest maybe a script was run that wrote temporary files which were then cleaned up.\n\nI notice powershell.exe is creating files in the user's Temp directory and also accessing other processes. There are multiple ProcessAccess events, which might indicate that PowerShell is querying information about other running processes, which could be normal or part of malicious activity like process hollowing or injection.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe being executed a few times. Using whoami usually isn't suspicious on its own unless it's used for privilege escalation, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file. That might be part of log management setup, so that's probably benign.\n\nThe notepad.exe and calc.exe events are generic, so they're likely not red flags unless there's something unusual about how they were used.\n\nI'm also considering if these events could indicate an ongoing attack like script execution or lateral movement. But the logs don't show any overtly malicious activities beyond normal process interactions and file operations.\n\nSince I'm only seeing process creation, accesses, and some file operations without any clear signs of exploitation, data exfiltration, or system modifications, it's possible these are legitimate user actions or part of a script.\n\nOverall, while there's activity that could be concerning, the evidence doesn't strongly suggest malicious behavior. However, the repeated use of powershell.exe and process accesses might warrant closer monitoring but aren't necessarily an immediate red flag.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential script execution or lateral movement, with file creation\/deletion suggesting temporary operations.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first three events are all from `svchost.exe` with the task being \"Registry value set\". Since svchost is a common Windows process used by services, these could be legitimate activities, but registry modifications can sometimes indicate malicious behavior, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\n2. Next, there's an event from `winlogbeat.exe` which created a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this might just be the tool setting up its configuration file. Not immediately suspicious unless the path or activity seems off.\n\n3. Then, I see two events from `powershell.exe`. PowerShell can do both legitimate and malicious tasks, so any process access could be concerning. However, without more context on what exactly was accessed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\n4. The next event is `whoami.exe` being executed with a standard command line. Whoami is commonly used for user identification purposes and isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger attack chain.\n\n5. Another powershell process access follows, which again could be either legitimate or malicious depending on the context.\n\n6. There are several events from `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, which is associated with Universal Windows Platform apps. Registry modifications here might not be unusual and likely don't raise red flags unless there's a known exploit involving this process.\n\n7. Multiple entries come from `chrome.exe` with DNS queries and network connection detections. Chrome is a common browser, so these activities are expected during normal usage, especially if the user is browsing different websites or downloading something.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious behavior that stands out. The repeated registry accesses by svchost could be concerning, but without additional context like timestamps or related events, it's hard to determine if they're part of a coordinated attack. The powershell activities might warrant closer monitoring if there are other indicators, but again, without more data, they don't necessarily signal an immediate threat.\n\nOn the other hand, the variety of normal processes accessing resources and performing standard actions (like chrome's network usage) suggests that this is just regular system activity. There's no single event or combination that jumps out as obviously malicious, so my confidence level in classifying this batch as not interesting is moderately high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creation and network\/dns queries. No clear signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
