This is suspicious because downloading files directly from such sources can indicate malicious activity or script execution. Also, the fact that it's creating temporary files and then deleting them adds to the suspicion—this behavior is often used by malware to avoid detection.\n\nThe repeated calls to download different files from GitHub also stand out. It's unusual for a legitimate process to make so many network requests to external repositories like this. Additionally, the use of powershell.exe with specific command lines that include DownloadFile is a common tactic in attacks to execute arbitrary code or retrieve malicious payloads.\n\nWhile some events show normal file operations, the combination of multiple file downloads and deletions alongside the process creation and registry modifications suggests potential tampering.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries related to powershell.exe. Specifically, there are command lines that show Powershell downloading files from GitHub repositories. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like Powershell for malicious activities. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files, which seems unusual since such files aren't typically executed or downloaded maliciously.\n\nLooking closer, the paths where these files are being saved are in temporary directories (e.g., $env:TEMP). Temporary files can be a sign of script execution, especially if they're part of a larger process. Additionally, there's a file named estrutura_temporario.txt and others like modulo_comum LICENSEs being downloaded. The naming suggests some form of structured data or possibly components of malware.\n\nAnother point is the repeated Registry value sets by chrome.exe and other processes. While Chrome can make registry changes, multiple such events might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms, which are common in malware to maintain access over reboots.\n\nThere's also a process where MpDefenderCoreService.exe made a network connection. Since that's part of Windows Defender, an unexpected network activity could mean it's trying to download updates or perhaps being exploited.\n\nFurthermore, the events involving winlogbeat.exe creating files might be normal if that's a legitimate service running logs, but the same file path being created multiple times could hint at some automated process or script execution.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of Powershell downloads from suspicious URLs, registry modifications by multiple processes, and network activity from security services raises concerns. These activities don't seem to be part of normal user behavior and could indicate a potential breach or attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories, which may indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal since those are standard Windows processes. The next few events involve svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. Svchost is a common system process, so these could be legitimate operations, but repeated registry writes might warrant some attention.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe also loading urlmon.dll, which again looks like part of normal operation. Moving on, powershell.exe accessing processes and registry events catches my eye. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so any unusual activity here needs to be flagged.\n\nI see cmd.exe being used with commands like SCHTASKS to delete tasks and REG DELETE to remove entries from the registry. These commands can be part of system administration but are also red flags when seen in sequences that might indicate deletion of persistence mechanisms or task schedules.\n\nThere's a schtasks.exe process deleting a specific task named \"spawn\". This could be an attempt to remove scheduled tasks, which is a common tactic for attackers to cover their tracks. The use of REG DELETE and other registry manipulations further supports the idea that something suspicious is happening.\n\nConhost.exe and reg.exe are also involved in registry operations. Conhost is often used by malicious scripts to hide their activity, and modifying the registry can be part of installing or removing malware.\n\nPutting it all together, the events show multiple processes accessing the registry, deleting scheduled tasks, and using command-line tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe. These actions are indicative of potential unauthorized access or attempts to remove traces of malicious activities. The combination suggests a possible attack where an adversary is trying to clean up after themselves or establish persistence.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows signs of malicious behavior that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of processes accessing the registry and deleting scheduled tasks, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the details, there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing processes, modifying registry values, loading images, and creating files. Specifically, there's a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory, which might indicate an attempt to execute something temporary.\n\nThe repeated process creations and access attempts could be part of a script trying different actions or modules. The use of various DLLs like mscoree.dll andclr.dll is normal for PowerShell scripts, but combined with the file creation\/deletion pattern, it raises suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, there's a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. While these are legitimate files, their interaction with powershell.exe could be part of an attempt to bypass or interfere with antivirus processes.\n\nThere are also entries related to creating pipes and interacting with startup profiles, which might be signs of persistence mechanisms or attempts to maintain access on the system.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it looks like a potential script is being executed in PowerShell.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal because it's a standard tool used to display user information. Then there are several entries related to powershell.exe, including process accesses and registry value sets. Powershell can be legitimate but is often misused for attacks, so I'll need to keep an eye on these.\n\nThere are also cmd.exe processes with command lines that look incomplete or maybe just part of normal operations. The use of conhost.exe caught my attention because it's known to be used by certain malware to hide their activities in the Task Manager. \n\nI notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various .dll files, which could indicate script execution or module loading.

That seems a bit odd because those aren't typically associated with malicious activities. But maybe it's just regular activity? I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, I notice several PowerShell processes. The command lines in some of these events show things like \"powershell.exe & {}\", which looks suspicious. Also, there are multiple registry modifications and file creations by PowerShell. Registry changes can be a red flag because attackers often modify the registry to hide their tracks or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process running with a command line that seems normal—it's just checking user information. But paired with all the other PowerShell activity, it might indicate an attacker trying to escalate privileges or gather information.\n\nThe file paths mentioned in the logs point to legitimate system files and DLLs, which isn't unusual for PowerShell scripts. However, the high volume of ImageLoad events could be a sign that something is loading multiple modules unnecessarily, possibly for obfuscation or lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines and registry modifications stands out.

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are from processes involving PowerShell.exe and Chrome.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has legitimate uses but can also be abused for malicious activities. The fact that there are multiple events from PowerShell makes me cautious.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged: There's an Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) for MpOAV.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. That seems normal since Defender would load its components. But then I see File created and File Delete logged actions by PowerShell. The files being deleted are in the user's Temp directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. Those temporary PowerShell script test files might be part of legitimate operations, but deleting them could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after some activity.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that delete specific .zip and .txt files in the TEMP directory. The paths being deleted include things like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. These seem like arbitrary names, which might not be standard for typical script operations. Also, using Remove-Item to delete these files without a clear reason could be suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent) tasks by both Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe. While Chrome accessing the registry isn't unusual, multiple such events combined with other actions might warrant attention.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was executed. That's a common tool used to check user permissions and could be part of legitimate activity, but in the context of other suspicious events, it adds another layer to consider.\n\nThe process accesses (ProcessAccess) by PowerShell and conhost.exe are also noted. Conhost.exe is often associated with running command-line tools like cmd or powershell without a window, which can sometimes be used for stealthy operations.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple file deletions in the Temp directory via PowerShell, combined with registry changes and process activity, raises flags. The repeated deletion of various files and the specific paths targeted make me think that something might be trying to clean up traces or remove malicious payloads. Additionally, the variety of file types (zip and txt) being deleted is a bit concerning.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions are malicious, but they do create a pattern that stands out. The confidence level isn't super high because some actions could be part of normal system operations, especially with Defender-related files. However, the combination makes it more likely than not that there's something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"The events involve multiple file deletions and process accesses by PowerShell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or system tampering.\",\n  \"DETAILS\": {\n    \"File Deletions\": [\n      \"Multiple files in the TEMP directory were deleted using powershell.exe commands, including .zip and .txt files with non-standard names.\",\n      \"Examples include tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, and others, which may not be typical for legitimate script operations.\"\n    ],\n    \"Registry Changes\": [\n      \"Registry value set events by both Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe could indicate configuration changes that might be suspicious in combination with other actions.\"\n    ],\n    \"Process Activity\": [\n      \"Use of whoami.exe to check permissions.\",\n      \"Conhost.exe execution, often associated with command-line tools for stealthy operations.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here, each line represents an event.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also commonly abused by attackers. The command lines show things like Remove-Item which deletes files in the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because deleting files in TEMP without good reason might indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the timeline, there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading images. This could be part of how the malware is trying to hide or change system configurations. Also, I see that it's creating and then deleting a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 in the Temp directory. That's unusual because creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'whoami.exe'. While this tool itself isn't malicious, it's often used by attackers to check permissions or identify the current user, which might be part of lateral movement within a network.\n\nThere are also entries where other processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are accessing registry values. Conhost is sometimes associated with command-line tools, but seeing it in combination with powershell activities could be suspicious.\n\nI'm concerned because there are repeated attempts to remove files from the TEMP directory using powershell commands. This behavior doesn't align with standard user activity and could indicate a script or tool trying to clean up traces of its actions. The creation and deletion of temporary files, along with registry modifications, make this batch stand out as potentially malicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events suggest possible unauthorized access, file manipulation, and system configuration changes. This makes the batch interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are deleting files in the TEMP directory, creating temporary files which are immediately deleted, accessing registry values, loading images, and other suspicious activities indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' with a registry value being set. I know that legitimate software often makes changes to the Windows Registry, so these might not be suspicious on their own unless they're happening abnormally frequently or in unusual ways.\n\nThen, there's an entry from 'RuntimeBroker.exe', which is another common system process, doing the same registry thing. That doesn't raise any red flags for me either.\n\nNow, looking at the events involving 'powershell.exe' with 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by admins but also by attackers. The frequency here stands out—there are multiple accesses in quick succession. This could be normal admin activity, or it might indicate someone trying to hide their tracks by using different instances.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' executions catch my eye too. The command line shows that it's just the basic 'whoami' without any extra arguments. By itself, this isn't suspicious because it's a common utility for checking user information. However, combined with the PowerShell activity, it might hint at some automated process or potentially malicious behavior trying to gather info.\n\nThere are events where files are being created by 'winlogbeat.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup, which makes sense for log management. The file paths seem standard, so probably not malicious unless there's something else indicating misuse.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch has a lot of PowerShell activity and process creations that could be legitimate admin tasks or signs of attack. While each individual event might not be suspicious, the volume and combination make me think this warrants closer investigation to rule out any malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creation and file activity involving potentially malicious tools like PowerShell and whoami.exe.
