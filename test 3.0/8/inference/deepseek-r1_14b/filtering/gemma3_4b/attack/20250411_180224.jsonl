{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed, which is a common tool used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines in some cases try to execute scripts that don't exist (like NonExistingScript.ps1), which might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or maybe just a typo.\n\nThen I notice cmd.exe and schtasks.exe are involved. They're being used to create scheduled tasks, like 'win32times', which run powershell commands with some parameters, including -ep bypass which can disable PowerShell's default security restrictions. This is a red flag because it's often used in attacks to execute arbitrary code.\n\nSVCHOST.EXE is also showing up multiple times modifying registry values and creating files. Since svchost is a legitimate process but can be hijacked by malware, these activities could indicate malicious behavior trying to hide or establish persistence.\n\nThere are several events from chrome.exe accessing the registry, which seems unusual because Chrome typically doesn't do that frequently. This might suggest some form of tampering or data collection.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files, and powershell.exe creating new text files in user directories. These could be related to logging or persistence mechanisms.\n\nWhoami.exe is also executed without any arguments, which is a common tool used by attackers to check privileges, so that adds more concern.\n\nOverall, the combination of using powershell with bypassing execution policies, creating scheduled tasks for persistence, registry modifications, and unusual activity from other processes like chrome.exe makes this batch of events highly suspicious. The repeated attempts to execute non-existent scripts and the use of schtasks to create persistent tasks are strong indicators of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe executions with bypass restrictions, creation of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe for persistence, and registry modifications by svchost.exe. These events indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
