{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where the process is `chrome.exe` with network connection detections. That in itself might not be too concerning since Chrome does make regular network connections. However, seeing several of these could indicate something unusual, like maybe an extension or script making multiple connections. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there are several events involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has legitimate uses but can also execute malicious commands. The command lines in some of these events look suspicious. For example, there's a command that modifies file last write times using `Get-ChildItem` and sets them to an early date (01\/01\/1970). This kind of activity is often seen in attempts to hide files or make them appear older, which might be part of an attack. The fact that the same script is run multiple times with slight variations also raises a red flag.\n\nThere are process creations and accesses for PowerShell, along with registry value sets. These activities could be part of establishing persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations maliciously. Additionally, there's evidence of file creation and deletion in temporary directories (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1`), which might indicate script testing or attempts to bypass certain security policies.\n\nAnother point is the use of multiple `ImageLoad` events for various DLLs when running PowerShell. While this can be normal, it could also suggest that the attacker is loading malicious modules or obfuscating their code within legitimate processes.\n\nThere's also a process named `RuntimeBroker.exe` modifying registry values and `notepad.exe` doing the same. These seem out of place since Notepad typically doesn't interact with the registry unless there's some script running under it, which could be another layer of attack.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of PowerShell activity with file manipulation, registry changes, and multiple network connections suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to modify timestamps on files and the specific command-line arguments are particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activities including file timestamp modifications, process creations with unusual command lines, and multiple registry changes, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are several PowerShell processes executing commands that modify file timestamps using 'Get-ChildItem' and setting the LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". This seems suspicious because changing file times can be a common tactic in malware to hide activity or prevent detection. The repeated use of PowerShell, especially with such specific command lines, raises red flags.\n\nNext, there are events where svchost.exe and conhost.exe are making registry changes. SvcHost is a legitimate process but often used by malware because it's commonly allowed through firewalls. Malware might create or modify registry keys to maintain persistence or configure system settings maliciously.\n\nThen I notice multiple instances of Calculator.exe loading the urlmon.dll file. While Calculator is a benign application, the fact that it's loading a DLL associated with URL handling could indicate some form of injection or unauthorized behavior. It's unusual for Calculator to interact with such modules unless something is amiss.\n\nThere are several events where processes like Chrome and winlogbeat.exe create files or modify registry entries. These might be normal, but the frequency could suggest something more. For example, repeated Registry value sets by different processes might indicate a coordinated effort, possibly related to persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe event involving 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file in the user's Downloads folder is also interesting. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and is legitimate, but if it's behaving abnormally, like creating files outside its expected directory, that could signal tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts, repeated registry modifications by various processes, and unusual file creation activities. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity rather than normal system operations. The combination points towards possible data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, or other adversarial actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious events, including repeated PowerShell command executions that alter file timestamps, registry modifications by svchost.exe and conhost.exe, unusual Calculator.exe activity loading urlmon.dll, and a potentially malicious winlogbeat.exe file creation. These indicate possible malicious activities such as persistence, data tampering, or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values and loading certain files. These seem like normal operations since Chrome often interacts with the registry and system files when running. The file paths mentioned, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, are known legitimate Windows components used for antivirus features, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely the tool being used to collect these logs, so it makes sense that it's creating configuration files. No issues here.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process creating a file named unidade_logico.txt. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious, but the action of creating a file isn't suspicious on its own. Without additional context like unusual command-line arguments or known malicious activity, this doesn't seem concerning.\n\nLooking at all events together, they don't indicate any signs of malware or unauthorized access. The repetitive registry writes by Chrome are typical, and the other processes are performing standard operations. There's no evidence of file creation in unexpected locations, process injection, network traffic, or other indicators that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't present any actionable intelligence for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system operations, including Chrome interacting with the registry and loading legitimate files, Winlogbeat creating configuration files, and Powershell creating a file.
