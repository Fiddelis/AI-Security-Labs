Let me go through each one and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, they're all from chrome.exe doing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that connects to the internet and does DNS lookups. Not too suspicious there.\n\nThen I notice some other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe accessing the registry. These are legitimate system processes; RuntimeBroker handles runtime brokerage in Windows, and Notepad is just a simple text editor. Registry access isn't unusual for them, so probably nothing to worry about here.\n\nMoving on, there's a calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a bit odd because Calculator typically doesn't need that DLL, which is related to URL handling. I'll keep this in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNext, svchost.exe is involved in multiple registry events and file creations. SvcHost is a common process for hosting Windows services, so some activity isn't unusual. However, creating new files under the Tasks folder might be worth looking into because that's where scheduled tasks are stored. The filenames like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" seem generic but could indicate something being set up to run on startup.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process running schtasks commands to create tasks that execute calc.exe on logon and startup, with system privileges. This is concerning because using command-line tools like schtasks from an elevated context (system user) can be a sign of malicious activity. Creating scheduled tasks to run arbitrary executables at system startup could indicate persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe accessing processes and registry entries might be another red flag. While PowerShell is legitimate, it's often misused for executing commands or scripts that have malicious intent. The combination with schtasks and cmd.exe suggests possible scripting or command execution to maintain persistence or spread further.\n\nThe multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in the Tasks directory reinforce the idea that something might be setting up persistent tasks. Malware often uses such techniques to ensure it runs at system startup, making it harder to remove and more persistent.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several red flags: unusual file operations by calc.exe, scheduled tasks created via schtasks from cmd.exe with system privileges, registry modifications by multiple processes, and the use of powershell.exe. These could indicate a potential malware infection or unauthorized system access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activities such as multiple scheduled tasks created via schtasks to run calc.exe on startup and logon, executed by cmd.exe with system privileges. Additionally, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll and powershell.exe accessing processes are concerning indicators of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and especially powershell.exe and chrome.exe. The tasks vary, but I notice a lot of 'Registry value set' events across several processes. This makes me think that these might be legitimate activities since many system processes interact with the registry.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with both 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' tasks. While powershell can be used maliciously, it's also commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks. However, the fact that it created a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' might raise an eyebrow. That filename doesn't immediately ring any bells as suspicious, but without knowing more about its content, it's hard to say.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is another point of interest. It's often used by attackers to gather information about the current user and system, so seeing that could be a red flag if it's part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe, there are several 'Registry value set' events and some image loads. The fact that Chrome is interacting with registry values isn't unusual since it might be updating settings or extensions. However, the repeated nature could indicate something more persistent, like a malicious extension or a script running in the browser.\n\nI also see some file creation events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. These are often related to log management or backups, but without context on what's being logged or backed up, it's hard to assess risk here.\n\nPutting this all together: there are multiple signs that could indicate malicious activity, like the use of powershell for file creation, whoami.exe execution, and potentially suspicious chrome.exe behavior. However, these actions could also be part of legitimate user activities or standard operating procedures, especially in an environment where system tools are used frequently.\n\nI'm on the fence here because while some events look concerning, they don't clearly indicate malicious intent without more context. It's possible that this batch is just normal usage with a few red flags, but given the potential for compromise, it's better to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including powershell.exe and chrome.exe show suspicious activities such as registry modifications, file creation, and process access. Additionally, whoami.exe was executed, which is often used for reconnaissance in attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
