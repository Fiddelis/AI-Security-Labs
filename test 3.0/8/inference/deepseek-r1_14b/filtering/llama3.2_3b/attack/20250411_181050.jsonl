{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial process is whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal because it's a standard command used to identify the current user. Nothing malicious there.\n\nNext up is cmd.exe running some commands with certutil. Certutil is a legitimate Windows tool, but I remember it can be misused for encoding and decoding files, which might be suspicious. The command lines here are using certutil to encode and decode calc.exe. That's interesting because calc.exe isn't typically used for malicious purposes, but encoding\/decoding could be part of an obfuscation technique.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with a task related to accessing something. Powershell is commonly used in attacks, so that raises my antenna a bit, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances where certutil.exe is being used again, this time setting registry values and creating files. The file paths are pointing to temporary locations, which are common for malicious activities because they're less likely to be monitored. The names like 'modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe' seem suspicious; they might be trying to hide the true nature of the file.\n\nThere's also a rundll32.exe execution, which is another tool that can be used for malicious purposes, especially when calling DLL functions. This event alone isn't concerning, but combined with others, it adds up.\n\nAdditionally, several events show chrome.exe accessing registry values multiple times. While Chrome is a common browser, frequent registry access could indicate an extension or script trying to establish persistence, which might not be malicious, but it's worth noting.\n\nA powershell.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder also stands out. Powershell scripts are often used for attacks, and writing files can be part of dropping malware.\n\nPutting it all together: certutil being used to encode\/decode calc.exe, multiple registry modifications, rundll32 execution, and powershell activity suggest possible malicious behavior. These activities could indicate an attempt at file obfuscation, persistence mechanisms, or even the deployment of malware.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including certutil encoding\/decoding files, powershell and cmd.exe execution, and registry modifications which are common in malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
