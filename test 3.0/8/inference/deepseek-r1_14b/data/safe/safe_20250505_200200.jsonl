{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a process named winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's likely part of the log management setup. Then, powershell.exe accessing a process but no file involved—that's a bit vague, but PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, so maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, ssh.exe connecting to a network—ssh is often used for remote access, which could be normal or malicious depending on context. But seeing it once might not be enough unless combined with other events.\n\nAnother winlogbeat event creating the same file again—could this indicate a repeated attempt? Maybe part of a backup or log rotation process.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing another process and then creating a file in the user's .ssh directory for known_hosts. That could be setting up SSH keys, which is legitimate if done by the user but might also be malicious if unauthorized.\n\nExplorer.EXE modifying the registry—this is common as part of Windows operations, so probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nMultiple events show powershell.exe being launched without specific commands, but some have command lines pointing to known PowerShell paths. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks could be normal PowerShell initialization, but too many might raise flags.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs—this is typical when applications load necessary libraries. However, the fact that multiple different DLLs are being loaded by powershell.exe might indicate script execution or more complex activity.\n\nThere's a file creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1). Creating and then deleting a script file could be part of testing permissions, which is concerning if it's attempting to bypass certain policies.\n\nThe Pipe Created event by powershell.exe suggests inter-process communication, which can be malicious but also legitimate for scripts.\n\nLastly, more ImageLoad events and another network connection attempt with ssh.exe. The repetition might indicate an automated process trying multiple actions.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch shows multiple interactions involving PowerShell and SSH, including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and known_hosts editing. These could be signs of malicious activity like script execution, unauthorized access attempts, or post-exploitation behavior. However, some events are normal system operations. The combination raises enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell and SSH activities, including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and known_hosts editing, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of two events from system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking at each event individually and then see if together they indicate something malicious.\n\nFirst event:\n- Process name: svchost.exe\n- Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\XboxLive\n\nSecond event is almost the same but with a specific file:\n- Process name: svchost.exe\n- Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\XboxLive\\AuthStateCache.dat\n\nI know that svchost.exe is a common system process used by various services. It's not inherently malicious, but it can be used by malware if compromised.\n\nLooking at the file paths, both are under the Xbox Live directory. The first event creates the main directory, and the second creates a specific file inside it. This seems related to normal XboxLive service operations since AuthStateCache.dat sounds like a cache file for authentication states.\n\nI should consider whether these actions are expected during normal operation. Since svchost.exe is handling this, especially in the context of Microsoft's own services, it might be part of legitimate system updates or user logon processes.\n\nI don't see any red flags here, such as creation of files outside known directories, attempts to write to restricted areas, or unusual file names. The paths are deep within standard Windows directories, which is typical for service-related operations.\n\nAlso, both events are consecutive, indicating a process creating a directory and then a specific file within it. This is consistent with how many services initialize their data storage upon startup or user login.\n\nIn summary, while svchost.exe can be a vector for attacks, the specific actions here don't show any signs of malicious intent. They align with normal operations related to Xbox Live services.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are part of legitimate system operations by the XboxLive service, showing file creation under expected paths.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
