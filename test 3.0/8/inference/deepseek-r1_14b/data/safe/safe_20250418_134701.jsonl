Let's break down what each part means to see if there's anything interesting here.\n\nFirst, the process name in all these events is \"git.exe\". That makes sense because Git is commonly used for version control and can trigger file operations. The task field in each event says it's a \"File created\" action under the rule \"FileCreate.\" So this indicates that files were being created by the git.exe process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\\". Then each path continues into different types of files under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/... The filenames are various .d.ts files like findLastFrom.d.ts, findLastIndex.d.ts, etc.\n\nHmm, these files seem to be TypeScript definition files for Lodash functions within the Cypress testing framework. Since this is in a \"node_modules\" directory, it's likely part of a JavaScript project setup. Git is probably cloning or initializing the repository and creating these files during installation or setup.\n\nI should consider if multiple file creation events are normal. In development environments, especially with tools like npm or yarn installing packages, it's common to see bulk file operations as dependencies are extracted and placed into node_modules. So seeing a bunch of .d.ts files being created by git.exe might not be unusual in that context.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity here? Well, git.exe is a legitimate tool, so unless it's been tampered with, which isn't indicated here, the file creations are expected during normal operations. The paths are standard for a development setup, pointing to a course materials folder (S206 - Qualidade de Software) suggesting this might be part of an educational project.\n\nAre there any red flags? Each event is just creating a single file, but since they're all under node_modules, it's likely related to package installations. There's no sign of unusual access times, paths leading to sensitive areas outside the user's Downloads folder, or other suspicious behaviors like deletions or accesses after creation.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events seem to be part of a normal development workflow where Git is setting up project dependencies.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what they have in common.\n\nFirst off, all the events are from a process named \"git.exe\". That's the Git version control system, commonly used for software development. The task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so it's about files being created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\\" which seems to be a user directory on a Windows machine. The rest of the path includes \"node_modules\", which is a common folder in Node.js projects for storing third-party modules.\n\nEach file being created has a .d.ts extension, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are used when working with TypeScript to provide type information. So it looks like Git is cloning or pulling down some repositories that include these TypeScript files.\n\nSince all the events involve creating files related to a Node.js project (specifically Cypress types), this seems normal for someone developing software, especially if they're using Git for version control and have such projects in their environment. There's nothing unusual here like failed logins, access to restricted areas, or unexpected file creations that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nI don't see any signs of anomalies or deviations from standard behavior. All the files are under a user's downloads directory within a project folder, which is where you'd expect development-related activities.\n\nSo putting it all together, these logs show a user working on a software project using Git, creating TypeScript files as part of their environment setup. There's no indication of anything suspicious or malicious happening here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows the creation of multiple .d.ts files by git.exe in a Node.js project directory, which is typical for developers using TypeScript.

They all have the same process name: git.exe. The task is consistently \"File created\" under the rule FileCreate. Each event points to a different file path within the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. These files are part of the lodash library's type definitions for functional programming methods.\n\nConsidering that these events involve creating files related to a development tool (Cypress) and a common library (lodash), this is typical during software development, especially when setting up or modifying projects. The repeated creation of type definition files suggests that the system might be initializing or updating dependencies.\n\nI need to assess if such activity is unusual.

So, I'm looking at these JSONL entries—each one seems pretty similar. They all mention the process name \"git.exe\", a file creation event under Windows log, and specific file paths.\n\nFirst off, the process is git.exe, which is commonly used for version control. That doesn't immediately raise any red flags because developers use Git regularly. The events are all labeled as FileCreate tasks, meaning files were created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're located in a \"node_modules\" directory under \"cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\". Node_modules is typical in JavaScript\/Node.js projects, and cypress refers to the testing framework. Lodash is a popular utility library for JavaScript. So these are all legitimate files created as part of a development environment.\n\nSince each event shows a different file being created—like isBoolean.d.ts, isBuffer.d.ts, etc.—it seems like Git is cloning or updating a repository, which would cause these files to be created. This is standard during development setups or when pulling updates from a remote repository.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The files are part of the Cypress types for Lodash functions, which are expected in such projects. There's no indication of unauthorized access, strange file names, or activities outside the scope of normal Git operations.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't seem suspicious.

Each one has some information about a file being created by git.exe.\n\nFirst off, all the events have the same process name: git.exe. That's consistent, so it doesn't seem like there are multiple processes involved here. The task is always \"File created,\" which suggests that each event is related to the creation of a file. \n\nLooking at the files being created, they're all under the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. The filenames are things like isNumber.d.ts, isObject.d.ts, and so on. These look like TypeScript files related to Lodash's functional programming utilities. So, it seems like someone is working with a Node.js project that uses Cypress for testing, given the node_modules and cypress folders.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is creating these files makes me think of Git operations like cloning a repository or pulling updates. When you clone a repo, Git checks out all the files, including these TypeScript definitions. So, this batch could just be part of someone setting up or updating their development environment.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No executable files being created, no access to sensitive directories beyond what's expected in a typical dev setup. All the file paths are under node_modules, which is standard for npm packages. There's nothing like creating or modifying system files, registry entries, or other indicators that might suggest something suspicious.\n\nThe consistency across all events—same process, same task, similar filenames and paths—doesn't raise any red flags. It looks entirely normal for someone working with Node.js and Git. If there were multiple processes involved or different types of file operations, I might be more cautious, but in this case, everything seems to fit a benign activity pattern.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events are likely just part of a developer's workflow.

Specifically, these files are part of the \"lodash\/fp\" directory, which makes sense because Lodash is a popular JavaScript library often used in projects with Node.js or frameworks like Cypress.\n\nSince all events involve the same process creating files in a development environment (the path includes \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which seems to be an academic course), this looks like standard file creation during development.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. They're all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". I need to provide a justification and confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nLooking at the events, each one has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path data. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which tells me that Git is being used here. The Windows log task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating a new file was created. \n\nThe file paths all point to different files within the same directory structure under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\". Each event corresponds to a specific .d.ts file, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files used for type checking in projects, especially those using Node.js modules.\n\nSo, let's break this down. Git being involved suggests that these are part of a version control system, likely during development. The creation of multiple TypeScript files under node_modules points to a project setup where someone is working with Cypress and Lodash libraries. This is common in front-end or JavaScript\/TypeScript development environments.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual process names, no restricted file accesses, and all the activities are related to typical development tasks. The fact that multiple files were created at once might be a bit unusual, but it's still within normal operations when modules are being set up or updated.\n\nConsidering confidence, I'm almost certain this isn't suspicious. All events align with standard user activity in a development context. Unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise, like an unusual user account or time of access, these logs don't raise any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file creation events from the git.exe process in a standard development environment, which is normal and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The task in the winlog is labeled as \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths all lead to different .d.ts files within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project, specifically under the lodash fp directory.\n\nSo, all these events are about files being created by the git process. Since they're all in the same location and from the same source, it seems like this is part of a normal development workflow. The user is working on a software project using tools like Git, Node.js, and Cypress, which is a testing framework for web applications.\n\nI know that when developers work with version control systems like Git, they often clone repositories or update dependencies, which can involve creating new files or updating existing ones in the node_modules directory. The fact that multiple .d.ts files are being created suggests that TypeScript definitions might be part of this project setup or an update process.\n\nLooking at each file path, they all relate to Lodash's functional programming utilities. These are standard libraries used in JavaScript and Node.js projects for utility functions. It doesn't seem like any of these files are associated with known malicious activities or indicators of compromise (IoCs). There's no indication of unusual file creation times, locations outside the project directory, or other red flags.\n\nAnother point to consider is that Git itself isn't inherently malicious. Developers use it regularly without causing security issues. The fact that all events come from the same process and are within a typical project structure doesn't raise any alarms. There's no evidence of file deletions, access to sensitive files, or other actions that would warrant further investigation.\n\nI also think about how system logs can sometimes have false positives. In this case, the consistent pattern and context suggest these events are part of legitimate development activities rather than malicious behavior.\n\nTaking all this into account, I don't see any signs that these log entries indicate suspicious or malicious activity. They fit the profile of a developer setting up or updating their project environment with standard tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development setup and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. \n\nFirst, let's parse each event. They all have similar structures: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\". The winlog field indicates that a file was created, triggered by a rule called \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all under the same directory, varying only in the specific .d.ts files being created.\n\nHmm, so all these events are from the same user (fiddelis), located in a folder structure related to a course on software quality. The path includes \"node_modules\", which is typical for JavaScript projects, especially with tools like Cypress and lodash. Since each event creates a different file under this node_modules directory, it seems like git.exe is cloning or updating the project's dependencies.\n\nI wonder if creating multiple files in the node_modules folder using git.exe is normal. Git often interacts with such directories when managing packages and dependencies. The fact that it's a series of small files being created (like .d.ts) suggests they're part of type definitions for TypeScript, which makes sense in a development environment.\n\nBut why would this be interesting? Well, sometimes malicious actors use legitimate tools like git for lateral movement or to drop files. However, the file paths here are typical for a development setup. Also, all events are from the same user and process, without any signs of unusual access times or multiple users. There's no evidence of file deletion or other suspicious activities.\n\nI should consider if creating so many files in quick succession is normal. Developers often run commands that download and install dependencies, which could explain a batch of FileCreate events. It's not uncommon for CI\/CD pipelines to trigger such actions automatically, especially during builds or deployments.\n\nOn the other hand, an attacker might create files to persist on the system, but the file types here (TypeScript definitions) don't serve that purpose. There's no executable being written; these are just data files used by the development tools.\n\nSo putting it all together: The events describe a normal part of the software development process—installing or updating project dependencies using git. Since there's nothing indicating unauthorized access, unusual behavior, or signs of tampering, this batch doesn't raise any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activity by git.exe during development setup, specifically creating TypeScript type definition files in a node_modules directory.

Each event is a JSON object, and they all seem to be related because they have the same structure. Let me break down what each part means.\n\nFirst, every event has a \"process\" field where the name is \"git.exe\". Git is a version control system used for software development, so it's pretty common on developer machines. Then there's a \"winlog\" field indicating that a file was created, specifically mentioning the rule \"FileCreate\". The \"file\" field gives the path to where the file was created.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all start with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\" followed by different filenames like \"rangeRight.d.ts\", \"rangeStep.d.ts\", and so on. These look like TypeScript files, which makes sense since .d.ts stands for declaration files in TypeScript.\n\nNow, considering that all these events are from the same process (git.exe) creating multiple files in a node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/, it seems like this is part of a normal development workflow. Node modules are typically where third-party libraries and their type definitions are stored. Cypress is an automated testing tool for web applications, often used with Node.js.\n\nSo why would git.exe be creating files here? Well, when you clone a repository or update dependencies using npm or yarn, it's common for node_modules to be updated or created, which might involve Git operations in the background if the project uses version control for dependencies. Alternatively, someone could be running commands that generate these files as part of building the project.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's anything suspicious here. The process is git.exe, but it's creating several files in a standard location for development tools. The paths don't seem to indicate any malicious activity like accessing personal data or system directories outside the user's control. All the file paths are within the user's Downloads folder and specific to a course named \"Qualidade de Software\" (Software Quality), which sounds educational.\n\nAnother point is that each event is just a file creation, nothing more. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, deletions, or modifications beyond creating these files. Since all events are consistent with each other in terms of the process and file paths, it doesn't look like an attack where different processes or varied activities would be present.\n\nI also consider that sometimes legitimate tools use Git for versioning, so even though it's creating multiple files, it might just be part of updating dependencies or initializing a new repository within the node_modules. This is especially true if someone is working on integrating Cypress into their project, as setup processes often involve generating type definitions and other supporting files.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure these events are not malicious because they fit a typical development scenario. The only thing that might raise an eyebrow is why git.exe is creating so many files in node_modules, but given the context of it being part of a course on software quality, it's plausible that this user is actively developing or setting up their environment.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events are likely from a legitimate development activity rather than any malicious or suspicious behavior. The consistency and expected nature of the actions make me confident in this assessment.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events represents normal development activities where Git is creating files within a project's node_modules directory as part of setting up or updating dependencies for a software testing tool (Cypress). These actions are consistent with typical workflows involving version control and package management, indicating no signs of suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe events are not indicative of malicious activity.

The filenames vary but they all end with .d.ts, which I recognize as TypeScript definition files. These files are usually part of the development environment, especially in Node.js projects.\n\nSince all events are from git.exe and involve creating files, this looks like a typical activity when setting up or modifying a project. Git is being used to clone or update repositories, and during that process, it's common for new files to be created. The location is under node_modules, which suggests this is part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project setup.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file paths, no executable files being created, and all the actions are related to standard development tools and processes. These events don't raise red flags like multiple failed login attempts, access to restricted areas, or deletions of system files, which would be more concerning.\n\nConsidering that the user is working on a course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"), it makes sense they're setting up their development environment with tools like Cypress and Lodash. The repeated file creation events are likely part of the build process or initial setup steps for their project.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure these aren't malicious because they fit a normal pattern for someone developing software.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of log events from a system. Each event is a JSON object representing something that happened on the Windows system. The main thing happening here is the creation of various files by the process \"git.exe\". \n\nFirst, I notice that all these entries are similar. They all come from the same process, git.exe, and each one reports a file being created in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\. The files have names like zipObj.d.ts, zipObject.d.ts, etc. These look like TypeScript definition files related to Lodash functions, which are part of the Cypress testing framework.\n\nSince all events are from git.exe, this makes sense because when you clone a repository or update dependencies using Git, it's common for many files to be created or updated, especially in node_modules directories where package files reside. The fact that they're creating multiple .d.ts files suggests that TypeScript definitions are being installed or built.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. There's no indication of access from unknown sources, failed logins, or attempts to execute malicious code. All activities seem related to normal software development processes—specifically, setting up a project with Cypress and Lodash, which requires these type definition files.\n\nThe same process (git.exe) is responsible for all events, and the file paths are all within expected locations for a node_modules directory. There's no variation in user accounts or times that would raise flags about potential attacks or unauthorized access.\n\nGiven this, the batch doesn't indicate any suspicious or malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries where each line represents an event on a Windows system. The key fields in each event are the process name, the task from winlog, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that all events have \"git.exe\" as the process name. Git is commonly used for version control, so it's not unusual to see it creating files. Each event's task is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates a new file being made.\n\nThe file paths in each event are located under the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. Specifically, they're in the lodash types folder. These files like initial.d.ts, intersection.d.ts, etc., look like TypeScript definition files for Lodash utility functions. It's typical for development tools to generate or update these files when setting up or modifying a project.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The consistent process name and predictable file creation in a standard development environment suggest normal operations. There are no anomalies, such as file accesses from unknown processes or attempts to modify sensitive system files. All the events follow a similar pattern, which aligns with expected behavior when working on a software project using Git.\n\nSince everything points to routine file creation during development, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. Therefore, it's not particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by git.exe in a standard development environment, which is normal and expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing some system activity. The process name in each case is \"git.exe\", which immediately tells me that these are related to Git operations. The task being logged is \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to TypeScript definition files (d.ts) within the node_modules directory of a Cypress installation. Specifically, each file corresponds to a different utility function from Lodash, like isError.d.ts or isString.d.ts. These are type definitions that help with static typing in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nSo, what's happening here? It seems like Git is creating these files as part of the repository's history. Since node_modules is a common directory for project dependencies, and these are standard Lodash type definitions, this activity looks normal during development or when working with version control systems. \n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. No unusual processes, external domains, or file accesses that would indicate an intrusion or suspicious activity. The consistent use of git.exe and the creation of expected files suggest routine operations rather than anything nefarious.\n\nTherefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security standpoint.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I've been given a set of log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine whether the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, looking at each event individually, they all have similar structures. Each line starts with the process name being \"git.exe\". The task is labeled as \"File created\" under the Windows log (winlog), and the file paths are various .d.ts files located in the node_modules directory of a Cypress project.\n\nI know that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in software development. So, it's not unusual to see this process creating files, especially when working with repositories or installing dependencies. The paths point to TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) within the node_modules folder, which is typical for JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nSince all these events are related to file creation during a git operation, I don't immediately spot any red flags. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, attempts to execute code, or modifications outside the expected scope of a development environment. The files being created are standard part of the Cypress library's type definitions, which are necessary for TypeScript support.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether these file creations are happening at an unusual time or in an unexpected volume. If this were a one-time occurrence or within normal intervals, it might not raise concerns. However, if there was a sudden spike in such events, especially outside of business hours, that could warrant further investigation. But in this case, the batch seems to be part of a routine process.\n\nI also think about whether the presence of .d.ts files is significant. These are generated declaration files and aren't typically executable or harmful on their own. They serve as a way for TypeScript to interface with existing JavaScript code. So, their creation doesn't inherently pose a security risk.\n\nAdditionally, considering that node_modules can sometimes be targets for malicious activities, like dropping files during an attack. But in this case, all the file paths are within the expected structure of a typical node_modules folder, and there's nothing unusual about the specific files being created—like executables or scripts.\n\nFurthermore, looking at the process name \"git.exe\" again, it's commonly used for cloning repositories, managing branches, pulling updates, etc. None of these actions inherently suggest malicious activity unless they're part of a broader suspicious pattern.\n\nI also think about whether there are any indicators of compromise (IoCs) in these logs. Since the files being created are standard and their paths are within a known project structure, there's no evidence of foreign or unexpected file names that might hint at malware or unauthorized access.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure that this batch isn't indicative of malicious behavior. However, if this were part of a larger set of logs showing unusual activities elsewhere in the system, I might reconsider. But based solely on these entries, there's no clear sign of anything wrong.\n\nOne last thing to check is whether git.exe could be a vector for attacks. While it's possible that an attacker could misuse git for certain purposes (like deploying malicious scripts), the act of creating type definition files doesn't fall into that category. It would require more specific actions, like executing arbitrary code or downloading malicious payloads.\n\nSo, putting it all together: normal file creation during a git operation in a development environment with standard node_modules structure and .d.ts files. No signs of unauthorized access, malware, or suspicious activities. Therefore, the batch isn't considered interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events is not considered interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Each event represents normal file creation activity during a git operation in a development environment. The process \"git.exe\" is commonly used for version control, and the files being created are standard TypeScript definition files within a typical node_modules directory structure. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or suspicious activities present in these logs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The events represent normal file creation during git operations in a development environment.

The event is a file creation under Windows, specifically in a path related to Node.js modules (`node_modules`), which suggests it's part of a development environment.\n\nThe file paths are all within a `cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash` directory, which points to Cypress testing tools and TypeScript definitions for Lodash functions. This further indicates that these files are part of the project's dependencies, likely created during setup or updates.\n\nContinuing through each event, they all follow the same pattern: `git.exe` creating files in the same directory structure. Each file is a `.d.ts` file, which is standard for TypeScript declaration files. These declarations help with IntelliSense and other IDE features but don't contain executable code themselves.\n\nSince all events are related to the creation of these type definition files by a legitimate process (`git.exe`) during what appears to be normal development activity, there doesn't seem to be any signs of malicious behavior here. There's no evidence of unusual file names, locations outside expected project directories, or indicators like writes to unexpected paths or attempts to execute scripts.\n\nMoreover, the repetition of similar events in a batch might just reflect a script or process that's installing or updating dependencies, which is common during development workflows. Such activities are typically monitored but not flagged as malicious unless they deviate from established norms.\n\nI should also consider whether `git.exe` is commonly used for such file operations. Yes, it often handles file management as part of its version control tasks, so this aligns with expected behavior.\n\nThere's no indication of any timestamps or anomalies that would raise red flags. All the events are consistent and within a typical setup for someone using Node.js and TypeScript in their project.\n\nTherefore, the entire batch doesn't present any signs of malicious activity.
