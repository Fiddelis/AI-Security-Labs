{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all system logs captured presumably by something like winlogbeat. Each line represents an event with details about processes, file operations, and registry activities.\n\nI start by noticing that there are multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention immediately. The fact that it's being invoked with the command line showing `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is a red flag because bypassing execution policies often allows running scripts that would otherwise be blocked. This is a common tactic in attacks to execute arbitrary code.\n\nLooking deeper into the events, there's a file creation event for `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\teste.ps1`, which was created by powershell.exe. The subsequent deletion of this file using `FileDeleteDetected` suggests that it might have been part of a script execution or an attempt to remove evidence after use.\n\nAdditionally, there are several image load events for various DLLs, includingclrjit.dll and mscoreei.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, their loading in the context of a PowerShell process could be part of malicious activities like loading obfuscated code or lateral movement tools.\n\nThe combination of multiple registry writes from different processes (mmc.exe, Explorer.EXE) alongside PowerShell's activity might indicate a broader pattern of persistence or privilege escalation. Registry modifications are often used to maintain access across reboots or to alter system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nThere are also events related to pipe creation and provider lifecycles in the context of powershell.exe. These could be indicators of communication channels being established, which is a common behavior in malware to exfiltrate data or receive commands.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it's concerning because the batch shows a series of activities that align with typical attack patterns: using PowerShell for script execution with bypassed policies, creating and deleting malicious scripts, loading potentially harmful libraries, and establishing communication channels. These actions, when seen in sequence, pose a significant risk to system security.\n\nTherefore, this batch is definitely interesting from an investigative standpoint as it shows signs of potential unauthorized access or malicious activity on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including execution with bypassed policies and file operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at each JSON object line by line.\n\nFirst, I notice that many entries have \"powershell.exe\" as the process name. PowerShell is often used for legitimate system administration tasks, but it can also be a tool for attackers because it's powerful and has scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking at the events, there are several ImageLoad events where PowerShell loads different DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These might be normal as part of running scripts, but sometimes malicious scripts load specific modules. I should check if these paths look legitimate or if they're pointing to unusual locations.\n\nOne event stands out: a File created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script file __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. Then, immediately after, there's a File Delete logged for the same file. Creating and then deleting a script file quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence. This behavior is a bit suspicious because why create and delete a script so fast?\n\nAnother event is Registry value set in PowerShell. Changes to the registry can be malicious if they're modifying system settings or creating new keys for persistence.\n\nThere's also an event where \"Execute a Remote Command\" is logged, but without a process name, it's harder to assess, though remote commands can be risky if not authorized.\n\nPutting this together, multiple actions involving file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory and registry modifications could indicate potential malicious activity. The combination suggests possible script execution and attempts to evade logging or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including rapid file creation\/deletion and registry modification, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
