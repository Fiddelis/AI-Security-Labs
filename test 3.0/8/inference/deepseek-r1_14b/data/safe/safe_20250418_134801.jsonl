It's normal for updates.\n2. **File creation time changed**: Also routine when files are updated or accessed.\n3. **CompatTelRunner.exe loading DLLs**: This is part of Windows Defender, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from services.exe and null processes related to logon and user account management. These could be system-level events during login or profile setup, which are standard.\n\nI notice several \"User Account Management\" tasks logged, likely due to group policies or user activity, which is usual.\n\nThere's a powershell.exe command mentioned. PowerShell can be malicious, but the command here seems benign—it’s checking for .inf files in Windows directory and looking for specific patterns. No obvious signs of exploitation.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a config file, which makes sense if they're setting up log monitoring tools.\n\nLastly, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal as part of its functionality.\n\nWhile there are many events, none stand out as overtly malicious. Most activities align with standard system operations, updates, and monitoring. The only potentially suspicious part is the PowerShell command, but without more context on what it's doing, I can't confirm any malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system operations, including updates, process creations, and monitoring activities.

The first event is chrome.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal since Chrome can modify settings.\n2. MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll. MsMpEng is part of Windows Defender, so that's expected.\n3. winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely a log management tool; creating files here is standard.\n4. CompatTelRunner.exe loading the same taskschd.dll as before. Again, this seems routine for system processes.\n5. svchost.exe creating several files related to NetworkService and DeliveryOptimization. Svchost is a common service host process, so file operations here are normal.\n6. MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe both creating and deleting a file. Edge updates often download and install new versions, which involves creating and then deleting temporary files.\n7. MpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related DLLs. That's standard behavior for Windows Defender processes.\n8. conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. These are legitimate system tools used in command-line environments; no red flags here.\n9. Git.exe creating multiple files in a node_modules directory. This looks like a user installing or updating Node.js packages, which is common for development purposes.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem to be part of normal system operations and software updates. No unusual patterns or signs of malicious activity jump out.

Each event is a JSON object, and they all seem to be from the same process: git.exe.

The variations in the paths show different files and subdirectories being accessed. For example, there's index.js, internal folders with more JS files, package.json, preload.js, etc.\n\nI know that node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js projects where third-party libraries are stored. Semver is a package related to semantic versioning, which is commonly used in software development for managing version numbers. The process git.exe might be involved because it's often used with npm (Node Package Manager) scripts or when dealing with Git repositories.\n\nSo the logs show that multiple files and directories under semver are being created. This seems normal if someone is working on a project that uses Node.js, especially if they're setting up or updating dependencies. The repeated file creations could be part of the installation process for the semver package or during a build process.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here. All events are from the same user and relate to standard operations within a development environment. There's no indication of failed login attempts, access to restricted areas, or other red flags that might suggest malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem particularly interesting from a security standpoint.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of JSONL events to analyze. Let me take a look.\n\nFirst off, each event has the same process name: git.exe. That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control and doesn't usually trigger security alerts on its own. But I should consider the context.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, every event has the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So it seems like each of these events is related to a file creation action. The files being created are all within a Node.js module directory structure.\n\nThe paths point to various files and directories under node_modules, which suggests that someone is installing or updating Node packages. For example, the first few events create files in semver, then serialize-javascript, set-blocking, etc. These are all standard npm package names.\n\nI notice that these events include not just JavaScript files but also documentation like README.md, LICENSE files, and others like CHANGELOG.md. That aligns with typical npm install behavior where a package's source code and metadata are extracted or created during installation.\n\nNow, considering the user context: the path includes \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...\", which implies this is happening on a Windows machine. It looks like part of a development environment setup.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity here? Well, git.exe performing file creation in node_modules doesn't raise red flags. If these were files outside expected directories or involved in known malicious activities, that would be different. But as it stands, this seems like legitimate software installation.\n\nI should think about the confidence level. Since all events are consistent with normal package installations and don't show any signs of tampering or unauthorized access, my confidence is high that this batch isn't concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files during a Node.js module installation process, which is a normal activity and does not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events. Each event is in JSONL format with three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information.\n\nThe process name across all events is \"git.exe\". That suggests the activity is related to Git operations. The task in each case is labeled as \"File created\", which indicates that files are being created during some process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located under a specific directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\.

Git is commonly used for version control, so it's plausible that the user is cloning a repository or installing dependencies using npm\/yarn, which would create these files and directories.\n\nEach event shows a different file being created by git.exe. This seems normal during the setup or update of a project. There's no indication of unusual behavior like access to restricted areas, repeated failed attempts, or creation of hidden files, which might be signs of malicious activity.\n\nMoreover, all events are consistent with each other, showing a pattern of file creation in a known software development context. The presence of multiple .js and .json files aligns with typical project structures, especially in Node.js environments.\n\nI don't see any red flags such as unexpected paths, access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, or signs of tampering. The frequency of events is also normal for such an operation; creating several files at once when setting up a module is standard.\n\nConsidering all these points, this batch doesn't raise any security concerns.
