{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where PowerShell and cmd.exe are being used with specific command lines. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that creates a service using sc create, which sets up a new service named win32times. The binPath points to cmd.exe running another script, but the path seems suspicious because it's referencing NonExistingScript.ps1 and component_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. These scripts don't exist on the system, which is a red flag—malware often uses non-existent files or scripts to execute malicious code.\n\nNext, there are multiple Registry value sets by various processes like services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and others. This could indicate that attackers are making changes to the system's registry, possibly installing persistence mechanisms or altering configurations to hide their activities. The frequency of these events across different processes suggests coordinated behavior, which might not be typical for normal system operations.\n\nLooking at other entries, there's an attempt by cmd.exe to query a service with sc qc win32times. This could be part of the setup process for the malicious service created earlier. Additionally, I see that conhost.exe is involved in registry changes, which is unusual because it's typically used for console hosting but might be repurposed here.\n\nThere are also some legitimate processes like notepad.exe and Calculator.exe accessing system32 files like urlmon.dll, which could be normal. However, when combined with the other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern about potential malicious behavior.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a file in the user's Downloads folder, which might just be part of log shipping or data collection but doesn't seem out of place on its own.\n\nPutting all these together—the creation of a service that runs a non-existent script, multiple registry modifications by various processes, and unusual command-line arguments—strongly suggests potential malicious activity. These behaviors are often indicators of an attack, such as persistence mechanisms, fileless malware, or other forms of system compromise. The combination is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process creations and registry modifications, including attempts to execute non-existent scripts and service creation activities, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events that I need to analyze. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the winlog task is 'Registry value set'. That seems a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't change registry values that frequently unless it's part of an update or configuration change. But doing this multiple times in a row might be a red flag.\n\nThen, towards the end, there are two more events from chrome.exe but now they're about loading images: one is 'amsi.dll' and the other is 'MpOAV.dll'. Those modules sound familiar. AMSI stands for Anti-Malware Scan Interface, which Windows uses to detect malicious activities. If a process is trying to load this, it could be an attempt to hide its actions or inject code into other processes.\n\nNext, there's an event from powershell.exe where the task is 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands. This event might indicate that a process was accessed, which could mean privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes by Chrome, which isn't typical behavior unless it's part of an update. The loading of AMSI-related DLLs is suspicious because it might be trying to subvert Windows' antivirus mechanisms. And then PowerShell accessing a process—this combination could indicate that something malicious is happening. It looks like potential signs of malware attempting to manipulate the system, possibly evading detection and using legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% sure because sometimes legitimate software can trigger these events. For example, updates or certain configurations might cause multiple registry writes. But the combination with PowerShell accessing a process and loading those DLLs makes me lean towards it being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry writes by Chrome.exe followed by image loads of anti-malware modules and a ProcessAccess event from powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
