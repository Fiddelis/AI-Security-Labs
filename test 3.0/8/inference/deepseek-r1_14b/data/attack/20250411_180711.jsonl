Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and a DNS query. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser and would typically make these kinds of connections. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I notice powershell.exe appearing several times with different tasks. One event shows 'Process Create' which is normal for any executable starting up, but there's also a 'Registry value set' which caught my eye. Modifying the registry can be part of malicious activities, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking deeper, there are events where powershell.exe is accessing various files and images like mscoree.dll and others. These might be legitimate for running scripts, but combined with other actions, they could indicate something more nefarious.\n\nThe command line in one of the powershell.exe events stands out. It looks like it's encoding some plaintext into cyphertext using XOR with a key. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide data being sent over the network. The fact that it's sending a POST request to example.com after encoding makes me think it's trying to exfiltrate data or establish communication with a remote server.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory. This could be an attempt to leave no trace of malicious scripts, which is common in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious actions like registry modifications, obfuscating data for network transmission, and creating\/then deleting files suggests potential malicious activity. While individual events might not be alarming, the combination points towards something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious activities such as registry modifications, obfuscation of data for network transmission, and file creation\/deletion patterns indicate potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let's take a look at what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with some command-line arguments. The command line seems to be doing something related to encoding and sending data over the network. Specifically, it's using XOR encryption with a key \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\" to encode plaintext into ciphertext. Then it sends this encoded data via an HTTP POST request to example.com.\n\nLooking at these events, each one is almost identical except for some variations in the 'winlog' field. For instance, some have 'Provider Lifecycle' and others have 'Engine Lifecycle'. That might just be different logging tasks but still related to the same process.\n\nAlso, I see that there are a couple of other processes like winlogbeat.exe creating files and loading DLLs. These don't seem suspicious on their own; they're likely part of log management or data collection tools.\n\nPutting this together, the repeated powershell.exe commands stand out. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The use of XOR encryption might indicate an attempt to hide data being sent over the network. Plus, sending data to example.com could be exfiltration if that domain is known for malicious activity or hasn't been verified as benign.\n\nI'm also noting that all these events are happening in quick succession, which isn't typical for normal system operations. This could be part of a script meant to send information periodically, but the encryption and specific commands raise flags.\n\nIn terms of justification, the combination of powershell.exe usage with obfuscation techniques like XOR and network communication makes this batch interesting from a security perspective. The repeated attempts might suggest an ongoing or automated process that could pose a threat.\n\nConsidering confidence, I'm pretty sure there's something to investigate here, maybe around 0.85, because while it doesn't conclusively prove malicious activity, the red flags are significant.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes and Activities:**\n   - Multiple events show `powershell.exe` running with command-line arguments involving XOR encryption and network requests.\n   - The same encrypted data is sent to `example.com`, suggesting potential data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - Powershell commands encode plaintext using a predictable XOR key, which may indicate an attempt to hide data.\n   - The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` for POST requests to an unverified domain raises concern about malicious activity.\n\n3. **Examine Network Communication:**\n   - Repeated attempts to send data to the same external domain could be part of a data exfiltration scheme or botnet communication.\n\n4. **Consider Context and Frequency:**\n   - The high frequency of these events within a short period is unusual for legitimate operations, suggesting possible automated malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Evaluate Other Processes:**\n   - While `winlogbeat.exe` and DLL loading are normal, they don't contribute to the suspicious activities observed in powershell.exe events.\n\n6. **Assess Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - The XOR encryption technique is a common tactic in APTs to avoid detection.\n   - Powershell is a favorite tool for attackers due to its legitimate use and script execution capabilities.\n\n7. **Determine Potential Impact:**\n   - If successful, this could lead to data loss, unauthorized access, or further system compromise.\n\n8. **Recommendations:**\n   - Investigate the source of these powershell.exe processes.\n   - Analyze network traffic related to `example.com` for malicious content.\n   - Review permissions and scripts running under powershell to identify unapproved activities.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch contains multiple suspicious powershell.exe processes using encryption to send data over the network, indicating potential malicious activity. **Confidence Level:** High (0.85) due to red flags like encryption, external domain communication, and repeated attempts."}

First, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nI notice several events involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be malicious but is also commonly used for legitimate tasks. The activities include file creation and registry changes. However, without context on user behavior, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from 'chrome.exe' with registry modifications and image loads. Chrome often interacts with the registry and loads DLLs, so these might be normal operations unless they're accessing unusual locations.\n\nLooking at other processes like 'conhost.exe', 'svchost.exe', and 'RuntimeBroker.exe', their activities seem typical for Windows processes, especially when it comes to registry interactions.\n\nThere are also events from 'Calculator.exe' and 'notepad.exe', which don't raise any red flags on their own. The file paths involved, like System32 DLLs, are standard.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be concerning if they're frequent or accessing sensitive areas, but without more context, it's hard to assess severity.\n\nI also see multiple instances where the same processes perform similar actions, which might indicate script execution or legitimate background operations rather than malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all events together, while some activities are unusual for certain processes, there's no clear pattern of malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of logs. I'm looking at a series of events from different processes, primarily PowerShell and Chrome. \n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that delete specific .bat files. These commands use the Remove-Item cmdlet with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, which immediately raises a red flag because they're common tactics in scripting to suppress errors and remove files without user interaction. The fact that these deletions are happening suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, I notice several registry accesses and modifications by both PowerShell and Chrome. While Chrome might legitimately interact with the registry for extensions or settings, multiple such events could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations stealthily, which is a behavior often seen in malware.\n\nThe file operations also catch my attention. PowerShell creates temporary files like 'estrutura_temporario.txt' and '__PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1'. The creation and subsequent deletion of these files within a short timeframe could be part of script execution to test policy settings or create persistence mechanisms. The use of temp directories is another common technique in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the image loads from .NET Framework DLLs, that's normal for PowerShell executing scripts, but combined with other behaviors, it adds to the suspicion. Furthermore, multiple RegistryEvent tasks by Chrome are unusual unless there's a legitimate reason, which doesn't seem evident here.\n\nPutting it all together, these events exhibit several red flags: file deletions without user interaction, temporary file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell executions with specific commands.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell and other command-line tools. I notice that several entries have 'powershell.exe' in the process name. For example, some events show 'command_line' with specific commands using Remove-Item to delete files. These commands seem to be targeting batch files located in various directories like \"C:\\elemento_temporario\\\" and others.\n\nI also see multiple instances where PowerShell is used without any command-line arguments except for a few that are executing system commands. This could mean someone is trying to execute scripts or perform administrative tasks, which might be normal if the user has such access, but it's worth looking into if these activities are unusual for the user or device.\n\nThere are events involving other tools like 'cmd.exe' and 'whoami.exe'. For example, one event shows cmd.exe being used with parameters to stop and delete services. The command is \"\/c sc.exe stop objeto_temporario>nul 2>&1 & sc.exe delete estrutura_secundario>nul 2>&1\". This looks like an attempt to remove services from the system. Using 'sc.exe' to manage services can be legitimate, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate malicious intent.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where registry values are being set or modified by processes like PowerShell, cmd.exe, and others. Registry modifications can be part of installing software or making configuration changes, but they're also a common tactic for malware to maintain persistence or alter system settings maliciously.\n\nI also notice that some events have 'File created' tasks related to the PowerShell profile directory. Creating files in user profiles might be part of legitimate script execution, but it could also be used by attackers to store malicious scripts or modify startup processes.\n\nThe fact that multiple different tools (Powershell, cmd.exe, sc.exe) are being used in sequence suggests a possible attempt to carry out several actions as part of a larger script or attack chain. The repeated use of 'Remove-Item' commands with forced deletion without confirmation is concerning because it indicates attempts to delete files without prompting the user, which could be an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nMoreover, the batch shows a lot of activity related to service management and registry changes, which are areas where attackers often look to establish persistence. The use of 'sc.exe' to stop and delete services might be an attempt to disable security-related services temporarily or permanently, which is a red flag.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but the sheer number of events in a short period could indicate rapid, automated activity typical of malicious scripts or bots. It's also worth noting that some processes are creating files in user directories, which might be an attempt to place malicious code where users have higher privilege levels.\n\nIn summary, while some activities could be part of normal system administration, the combination of multiple tools, forced deletions, service modifications, and registry changes raises suspicions. These patterns align with common tactics used in cyberattacks, such as persistence, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"有兴趣\": true,\n  \"理由\": \"该批次日志显示出异常的活动模式，包括使用PowerShell进行文件删除、cmd.exe和sc.exe用于服务管理以及 registry modifications，这些行为可能表明存在恶意活动。\"\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events involve various processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The tasks include process creation, file operations, registry changes, image loading, and pipe creation.\n\nI notice that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with unusual command lines. For example, one event shows the command line as \"& {}\", which is a bit odd because it's just an empty ampersand—usually not typical PowerShell usage. This could be a sign of obfuscation or attempts to hide malicious activity.\n\nThere are several Registry value sets from cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that might indicate malicious behavior, though it's also common for legitimate software.\n\nI see file creation and deletion events involving PowerShell scripts in temporary directories. The script is named with a .ps1 extension but has an unusual name. Creating and then deleting such files quickly might suggest an attempt to avoid detection or execute code without leaving a trace.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks related to powershell.exe. This could indicate that the PowerShell engine is being manipulated in ways that aren't standard usage, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThe repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with varied command lines raises suspicion. Especially concerning is the deletion of a file in the %temp% directory (del \/A:H %%temp%%\\tarefa_logico.txt >nul 2>&1), which might be an attempt to remove logs or evidence of prior activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the batch of log events provided is interesting for investigation from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n\nLooking at the logs, I see a lot of activity involving PowerShell and cmd.exe processes. Specifically, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that include things like Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory. For example:\n\n1. {\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Provider Lifecycle'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n\nThis command is attempting to delete a log file in the TEMP directory, ignoring any errors if it doesn't exist. This kind of activity could be part of normal script execution, but it's also common in malware or malicious scripts to clean up traces of their activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets and File creation events associated with PowerShell. For example:\n\n2. {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n\nMalicious actors often use registry modifications to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAnother point is the deletion of a file in the TEMP directory via cmd.exe:\n\n3. {\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\modulo_base.exe'}\"}\n\nDeleting files, especially in TEMP directories, might be an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activities. The fact that it's done via cmd.exe adds another layer, as cmd is often used for executing commands and can be part of a larger script or payload.\n\nMoreover, the repeated execution of PowerShell with various command lines suggests possible scripting or automated behavior. Malware frequently uses such techniques to execute code in stages or to avoid detection by varying their attack vectors.\n\nThe combination of these activities—deleting files, modifying registry entries, using multiple processes (cmd.exe and conhost.exe)—raises suspicions. These actions don't appear to be part of normal user activity and could indicate an attempt at persistence, data exfiltration, or covering tracks.\n\nTherefore, the batch is classified as INTERESTING because it exhibits signs that may indicate malicious behavior, such as file deletions in TEMP directories, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell executions which are common in attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of suspicious activities including file deletions in the TEMP directory, Registry modifications, and repeated execution of powershell.exe with specific command lines.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the batch of events provided is relevant for investigation. Let me start by looking through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving 'powershell.exe'. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. Malicious actors often use it to execute scripts or commands without being easily detected.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they're about image loading tasks. This is normal when any program starts up, so maybe not suspicious on its own. But then there's an event where a file is created in the user's Temp directory: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1'. Creating files in temporary directories can be part of script execution, which could be a sign of something malicious trying to test privileges or avoid detection.\n\nThe next event shows that this file is deleted. So the same process creates and then deletes a file quickly. This might be an attempt to remove evidence, which is a common tactic in malware. It suggests some kind of script was run to delete itself or logs.\n\nThen there are multiple events where 'powershell.exe' is called with specific command lines: {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}. This command tries to delete a file named key.log from the TEMP directory, ignoring any errors. This could be an attempt to remove log files that might contain sensitive information or evidence of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event where 'conhost.exe' accesses registry values and creates processes. While conhost is a legitimate Windows process used by console applications, it being paired with other actions involving PowerShell might indicate command execution in a hidden window, which is a technique used to hide malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Registry value set tasks by powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami is typically harmless, but when combined with other events, it could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, attempting to remove specific log files, use of PowerShell with commands that delete files, and registry modifications. These behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activity. The combination suggests an attempt to execute a script (possibly for persistence, data exfiltration, or other malicious purposes) while trying to cover tracks by deleting logs.\n\nHowever, some events might just be normal PowerShell usage or system processes. But the repeated attempts to delete specific files and the creation\/deletion of temporary script files are red flags. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible that these actions are part of legitimate scripts, but the pattern is concerning enough for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Investigation Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity. Key points include:\n\n1. **Excessive PowerShell Activity**: Multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' running with specific commands to delete files and access registry values suggest possible unauthorized actions.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion in Temp Directory**: The creation and subsequent deletion of a script file ('__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1') may indicate attempts to execute and then remove evidence, a common tactic in malware.\n\n3. **Command-Line Arguments for File Deletion**: Attempts to delete a log file ('key.log') using the command {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore} suggest an effort to erase potential traces of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Use of 'conhost.exe' and Registry Modifications**: While 'conhost.exe' is legitimate, its pairing with other events and registry modifications by PowerShell could indicate hidden command execution or information gathering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe observed activities are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The combination of file manipulation, potential script execution, and attempts to cover tracks suggest a high likelihood of malicious intent. While not conclusive, these patterns merit deeper analysis to ensure system integrity and security."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step and see what's going on here.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe loading an image, specifically clrjit.dll, which is part of the .NET framework. That seems normal because PowerShell often loads various DLLs when running scripts or commands.\n\nNext, another powershell.exe instance loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Again, that's a legitimate file used by Windows Defender for antivirus operations, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's a file creation event in the Temporary folder with a PowerShell script test file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1. That looks like it could be part of some policy testing or perhaps an attempt to execute a script. I should keep this in mind because creating temporary PowerShell scripts can sometimes be used for malicious purposes.\n\nFollowing that, the same file is deleted immediately after creation. The quick create and delete might be a red flag because adversaries often clean up their tracks by deleting files they don't need anymore. But it could also just be a legitimate test script cleanup process.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe creates pipes, which is common when dealing with command-line operations or communication between processes. These in themselves aren't malicious unless used for something like IPC in a way that's unexpected.\n\nThen I see some events where powershell.exe is called with an empty command line '& {}'. That looks odd because it's not executing any obvious commands. Empty command lines can be suspicious as they might be trying to bypass certain security checks or loggings.\n\nThere are several instances of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in the logs. These relate to how PowerShell initializes and manages its providers, which is part of normal operation, but repeated occurrences could indicate some instability or perhaps attempts to load modules in a loop.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file related to the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. This is where PowerShell stores profile data for non-interactive sessions, so it's expected, but I need to check if this activity aligns with normal user behavior on the system.\n\nA registry value being set by powershell.exe could be part of script execution or configuration changes. Depending on what's being set, this might be normal or could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are instances where whoami.exe is run from the system32 directory. Whoami is a standard utility to get user information, so unless it's being used in an unexpected way, this shouldn't raise flags. However, multiple executions might suggest some probing of user identity by scripts or processes.\n\nLooking at another event, winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file in its data folder. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management and shipping, so this seems legitimate unless it's being misused as part of an attack chain.\n\nThroughout the logs, powershell.exe is frequently accessing other processes, but without context on what those accesses are for, it's hard to say if that's normal or not. However, repeated process access could indicate some form of automation or script execution.\n\nPutting all this together, there are a few concerning points:\n1. Multiple quick file creations and deletions in the temp folder by powershell.exe.\n2. Powershell.exe being called with an empty command line '& {}', which is unusual.\n3. The repeated lifecycle events for PowerShell providers, possibly indicating instability or malicious behavior.\n\nI should also consider if these activities are part of a legitimate script execution process or if they're signs of something more nefarious like a script testing multiple exploit vectors or attempting to stay under the radar by deleting traces quickly.\n\nAnother angle is whether this activity correlates with known attack patterns. For example, creating and deleting temporary scripts might be part of a fileless malware approach or part of a persistence mechanism where the script deletes itself after execution.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe could be part of user enumeration during an attack to gather information about system users, which would be a red flag.\n\nIn summary, while some activities are normal, others like the quick temp file operations and empty command lines warrant closer inspection. These could indicate that the system is being used for malicious purposes, such as testing exploit scripts or attempting to hide traces of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits a mix of typical and potentially suspicious activities, necessitating further investigation.\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activities:**\n   - **Suspicious:** Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and immediately deleting temporary script files in the temp folder could indicate attempts to hide malicious activity or test exploit scripts.\n   - **Concerning:** Powershell.exe being called with an empty command line '& {}' is unusual and may suggest efforts to bypass logging or security checks.\n\n2. **Registry and File Operations:**\n   - Registry modifications by powershell.exe need monitoring for any unauthorized changes that could facilitate persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Use of whoami.exe:**\n   - Repeated execution of whoami.exe from system32 might indicate user enumeration, a common tactic in early stages of an attack to gather information.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - Creation of configuration files by winlogbeat.exe appears legitimate unless misused as part of an attack chain.\n\n5. **Process Access and Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Frequent process accesses and provider lifecycle events in PowerShell could indicate instability or malicious automation, warranting closer examination.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the potential indicators of suspicious activity, it is advisable to conduct a detailed investigation into these processes. This should include checking for any unauthorized changes, correlating logs with known attack patterns, and possibly deploying additional monitoring tools to detect and respond to threats effectively."}

Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe being accessed, each marked as \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. Frequent accesses could be normal admin work or signs of malicious activity like script execution.\n\nThen there are several instances of whoami.exe being created and run. Whoami is typically used to check user permissions, which seems benign, but in some cases, attackers might use it to gather info on the system's context.\n\nLooking further down, I see a process involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log management, so if that's running, this could be part of normal logging setup or data collection processes.\n\nAlso, there's one event where powershell.exe accessed a Registry value. That's notable because registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.\n\nThe events seem repetitive with many powershell and whoami executions without any other file or registry activity beyond what's noted. There's no indication of unusual files being created or network traffic, which might have raised more red flags. \n\nConsidering the frequency, having multiple process creations and accesses within a short period could be part of legitimate scripts or background processes, especially if this is from an internal admin account. However, powershell.exe's flexibility makes it a favorite for attackers, so repeated access without clear justification might warrant closer look.\n\nBut since most events don't show any malicious intent beyond the use of these tools and no other suspicious actions like writing to unusual files or network connections, I'm leaning towards this not being immediately concerning.
