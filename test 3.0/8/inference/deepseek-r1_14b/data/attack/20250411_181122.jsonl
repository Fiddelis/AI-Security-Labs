{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about whoami.exe being executed. That's a common tool for checking user information, so it's not inherently suspicious unless used inappropriately.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries related to powershell.exe. PowerShell can be legitimate but is often abused by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines here seem to involve searching for files with certain extensions and patterns like \"pass\". This could indicate someone looking for sensitive information or trying to extract credentials.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several events where PowerShell accesses the registry and creates or deletes files. Creating a temporary script file and then deleting it might be an attempt to avoid detection. Also, multiple entries of the same command line suggest repeated attempts, which could be part of a malicious process.\n\nThe mention of Provider Lifecycle tasks in some events makes me think about how PowerShell interacts with its configuration or modules, potentially trying to load malicious scripts.\n\nOn the other hand, there are normal processes like notepad.exe accessing the registry and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which don't raise any red flags. There's also an event related to winlogbeat.exe creating a config file, which is likely from a legitimate log management tool.\n\nPutting it all together, while some activities could be innocent, especially the repeated PowerShell commands searching for sensitive terms and the temporary script creation\/deletion, these actions are concerning. They align with tactics used in cyberattacks, such as data exfiltration or credential harvesting. The combination of multiple suspicious events points towards potential malicious behavior that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events with potentially malicious command lines searching for sensitive terms like 'pass' in various file types, as well as the creation and deletion of temporary script files.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first line, there's a process named powershell.exe loading an image. Not too unusual, but PowerShell can be used maliciously, so I should keep that in mind.\n\nThe second event also involves powershell.exe with a command line that includes findstr searching for 'pass' in various file types. This might indicate someone is looking for sensitive information like passwords. That's a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware to hide processes or modify system configurations. The repeated registry writes could be suspicious, especially if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nThen I see Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's odd because Calculator typically doesn't interact with such DLLs, which might handle URLs or network-related functions. This might be an attempt to execute malicious code under the guise of a legitimate app.\n\nThere are several entries where processes like OfficeClickToRun.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and others are modifying registry values. While some of these are known for normal operations, repeated or unusual modifications could indicate tampering with system settings, which is concerning.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This might be an attempt to persist across reboots by placing scripts or configurations there, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nMultiple instances of chrome.exe modifying registry values and making DNS queries stand out. While Chrome can access various resources, the volume here seems high, especially since other processes are also doing similar things. It could indicate unauthorized activity or an attempt to mask malicious actions under legitimate ones.\n\nFinally, winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file is probably just part of its data collection process, so that's less concerning unless there's evidence it's being misused.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activities: searching for sensitive info with powershell and findstr, unusual file operations by Calculator.exe, repeated registry modifications by various processes including svchost and chrome, and attempts to create startup profiles. These could be indicators of a breach or ongoing attack, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as PowerShell command-line arguments searching for sensitive information, unusual file operations by Calculator.exe, repeated registry modifications, and potential persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this batch of events to see if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll look at each event and note any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Image loaded, Registry value sets, and Network connections. Chrome is a common application, so these could be normal activities unless there's something unusual about the files or registry keys involved. In the first event, chrome.exe loads MpOAV.dll which seems legitimate as it's part of Windows Defender.\n\nThen there are several instances where powershell.exe creates files. For example, creating 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. PowerShell is often used for system administration but can also be a vector for attacks. The creation of these files might be normal, but the naming seems generic, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nI see commands executed via cmd.exe like deleting scheduled tasks with schtasks. This could indicate someone trying to remove malicious tasks or legitimate cleanup. However, the command lines are in Portuguese (\"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\", etc.), which might suggest a localized system but doesn't necessarily mean anything suspicious.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is run. That's usually used to check user permissions and shouldn't be inherently malicious unless it's part of a larger sequence.\n\nsvchost.exe loading taskschd.dll is normal as it's related to scheduled tasks, so that's probably fine.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, while there are activities involving system tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and schtasks.exe, which can be red flags, the specific actions don't show clear signs of malicious behavior. The files created by PowerShell are just text files in a user's downloads, which could be benign. The network connections from chrome.exe might be normal browsing activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards these events being legitimate system operations rather than malicious. There's no evidence of known attack patterns or clearly suspicious file paths or registry modifications beyond what's expected.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes normal system activities such as browser processes, PowerShell and cmd.exe usage for legitimate tasks, and scheduled task management.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me go through each one to see if there's anything unusual or concerning.\n\nThe first event is about schtasks.exe deleting a task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because it's an administrative tool being used to delete tasks. Maybe someone is trying to remove scheduled jobs?\n\nNext, schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll—that's normal since it's part of the system.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe modifying the registry. Svchost is a legitimate process, but any changes to the registry could be malicious if unexpected.\n\nCmd.exe setting a registry value—cmd is commonly used for commands, so without more context, it's hard to say, but combined with other events, it might indicate something.\n\nConhost.exe also setting registry values. Conhost is often associated with command-line interfaces; again, not inherently bad, but multiple registry changes are notable.\n\nPowershell.exe being accessed and then setting a registry value. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities. Accessing it could be normal, but combined with other actions, it raises a flag.\n\nWhoami.exe running—it's usually harmless, but in this context, after other suspicious events, it might indicate an attempt to gather user information.\n\nPowershell.exe accessed again—this repetition suggests something is being done in the background, possibly malicious.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command deleting notepad.exe processes. Notepad isn't typically malicious, but deleting its processes could be part of a cleanup operation by malware.\n\nWMIC.exe running commands to delete processes and loading various DLLs. WMIC is often abused by attackers for remote control and process management. The repeated use and specific commands here look concerning.\n\nMultiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values—this pattern suggests potential command execution or persistence mechanisms, which are red flags.\n\nDeleting user accounts via net.exe and net1.exe commands—these are legitimate commands but deleting users without authorization is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of process creation and deletion, especially with tools like schtasks, cmd, powershell, and WMIC. These activities don't look like normal user behavior. The repeated deletions of tasks, processes, and user accounts are concerning. It seems like someone is trying to clean up their tracks or disable system components, which is typical in an attack.\n\nSo, the batch as a whole shows signs of potential malicious activity. I'm confident enough that this needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including deletion of scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and user account deletions using tools like schtasks.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, many involve processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe. These are common system tools, but their usage could be malicious if used inappropriately.\n\nI notice several instances where these processes are being executed with specific command lines. For example:\n- cmd.exe is used with \"\/c net user ... \/del \/domain\" which seems to delete a user account.\n- Similarly, net.exe and net1.exe are deleting users as well.\n- sc.exe is deleting the 'win32times' service.\n\nThese actions—deleting users and services—are concerning because they could be part of an attack to remove traces or disable security features. The fact that multiple commands are being run suggests a pattern, possibly indicating a methodical attempt to clean up after some malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where powershell.exe is accessed but no file is associated. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, making it a red flag when executed without clear purpose.\n\nThe events also show processes accessing the registry (Registry value set or object added\/deleted). Such activities can be part of persistence mechanisms, where attackers modify the system's configuration to maintain access or hide their tracks.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, if these events are sequential and from around the same time, it strengthens the case that they're part of a coordinated attack. The repeated use of different tools (cmd, powershell, net, etc.) could indicate an attacker using various methods to achieve their goals, possibly lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nMoreover, the deletion of user accounts and services might be attempts to remove evidence or disrupt normal system operations. This kind of activity is often seen in ransomware or APT attacks where attackers try to erase their tracks after exfiltration.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that these actions are part of legitimate administrative tasks, but given the variety and volume of potentially destructive commands, it's more likely malicious. The combination of user deletions, service removals, and registry modifications points towards suspicious activity.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the cumulative effect suggests a higher probability of malicious intent. However, without more context like exact timestamps or user accounts involved, it's hard to be 100% certain. Still, the pattern is strong enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as deleting users and services, using powershell.exe without associated files, and registry modifications, which could indicate an attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm trying to figure out if these events indicate any malicious activity that would require investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's being called with \"& {}\" at the end of some command lines might be a way to obfuscate or hide certain actions. Obfuscation is often a tactic used in cyberattacks to avoid detection.\n\nLooking deeper, there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, ensuring that they survive reboots. The cmd.exe entries show attempts to delete files in the Temp directory, which might be an attempt to remove traces or clean up after some malicious activity.\n\nI also see several FileDeleteDetected events from cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Deleting specific files could indicate an attempt to cover tracks, especially if those files are related to malware components like executable files with names like \"tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\". These filenames seem suspicious, possibly part of a payload being executed.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this is normal for script execution, the combination with other activities might raise flags. The repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks in the logs could be signs of PowerShell initializing or tearing down environments, which can sometimes correlate with malicious scripts running.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe to check permissions or user information is another point. Legitimate use cases exist, but when combined with other suspicious actions, it might suggest an attacker trying to escalate privileges or gather system info.\n\nI'm also noticing a lot of process creations and accesses for powershell.exe, which could be indicative of lateral movement within a network if this activity is occurring across multiple systems.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated deletions in Temp, registry modifications, obfuscated command lines, file creation and deletion by PowerShell, and the use of whoami—all of these are red flags. They suggest possible malicious activities like persistence, data exfiltration, or payload execution.\n\nWhile there's no direct evidence of data being stolen or systems compromised, the combination of these events creates a concerning pattern that merits closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities, including file deletions in Temp directory, registry modifications, obfuscated command lines, and repeated FileDeleteDetected events.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. They're all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nLet me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few events are related to powershell.exe. It starts with 'Pipe Created' and then moves on to 'Engine Lifecycle'. Then there's an Image Load for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal because Defender would load its components. Next, a file creation under the PowerShell profile directory—that could be a user setting up their environment or some script running.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're common in both legitimate scripts and malware for persistence. Also, I notice that whoami.exe is being executed a few times, which is often used to get system information. Not inherently malicious, but could be part of an enumeration process.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file—it looks like it's setting up some configuration, probably for log shipping or monitoring. That makes sense if the system has the ELK stack installed.\n\nI see other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe modifying registry values. These are known legitimate processes; RuntimeBroker is part of Windows for managing runtime events, and svchost.exe is a common host process for various services. Not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe accessing the registry—that's normal for any application that might need to read or write settings. Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is also standard; many system processes load this DLL.\n\nLooking at all these events together, it seems like a lot of legitimate activity, especially from PowerShell and common system processes. The repeated whoami.exe executions could raise an eyebrow, but without more context, they might just be part of some automated script or user checking their permissions. \n\nI don't see any red flags like unusual file creations, writes to unexpected locations, or known malicious process names. All the files referenced are either legitimate system components or standard user profile directories.\n\nSo putting it all together, while there's a fair amount of activity involving PowerShell and some registry access, nothing jumps out as overtly suspicious when considering the entire batch. It might indicate normal system operation or routine scripting but doesn't reach the threshold for being classified as definitely malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes and legitimate activities such as Windows Defender loading, PowerShell profile setup, and use of common tools like whoami.exe. There are no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That makes sense because winlogbeat is likely the log agent itself, so it's normal for it to create or update its configuration files.\n\nNext, there are two events involving powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is a common tool and can be used both legitimately and maliciously, but without additional context like unusual command lines or high privileges usage, these might just be standard operations.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is run with the default command line. Whoami is often used by scripts to check user information, so unless it's part of an escalation chain, this doesn't raise a flag.\n\nLooking further, there are entries about ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing registry values. Both are standard system processes; they might be checking or setting configuration details as part of their operation.\n\nThere's a series of events from chrome.exe: multiple DNS queries and network connections. This aligns with typical browser behavior, especially if the user is browsing different sites or loading resources. The repeated NetworkConnect tasks could indicate regular web activity but nothing suspicious unless there are signs of data exfiltration or unusual domains being accessed.\n\nPutting it all together, most events here seem to be standard system and application activities without any red flags. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, process creation from unexpected sources, or anomalies in file accesses or network traffic beyond what's expected for a user interacting with their machine.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple events could indicate some level of monitoring or active log capturing, but since it's within normal operational parameters, there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here. The confidence level is high that these are not indicative of an attack because all activities align with expected behaviors for the listed processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system and application activities such as file creation by winlogbeat.exe, process access by PowerShell, registry modifications by standard executables, and typical network and DNS activities from Chrome.
