{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is \"powershell.exe\" with command lines that create scheduled tasks using the AtLogon trigger and run as BUILTIN\\Administrators with Highest privileges. This seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with such high-level access is often a tactic used in attacks to maintain persistence on a system.\n\nThere are several events where different task names are being registered, like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The fact that multiple similar tasks are being created suggests an attempt to create multiple backdoors or ensure persistence across reboots.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries showing registry value sets and process accesses related to powershell.exe. These actions could be part of establishing persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network. The file paths mentioned in ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc., are normal for PowerShell as it relies on the .NET framework, but seeing these combined with the other activities makes me more cautious.\n\nLooking at the types of Windows logs (winlog), many are related to Provider Lifecycle and Process Create\/Access. These events typically indicate system processes, but when paired with the suspicious command lines, they might signal something malicious like a process injection or persistence setup.\n\nConsidering all these together, it's likely that an attacker is using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks for persistence or lateral movement. The repeated attempts to register similar tasks under Administrator privileges are red flags. This batch shows a pattern of potentially malicious activity aimed at establishing a foothold in the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges suggest potential malicious activity for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands. The first few events show powershell.exe loading images like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. These files might be legitimate since they're from Microsoft Defender, but sometimes malicious actors can use such modules for persistence or other activities.\n\nThen there's a file creation event where a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1 is created and immediately deleted. Sudden file creation and deletion could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies by testing if scripts are allowed, which might be part of reconnaissance or a test run before deploying more harmful code.\n\nLooking further, there's a scheduled task being created using powershell.exe. The command line shows that it's setting up a task to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. While calc.exe is innocent on its own, the way it's executed via a scheduled task and with elevated rights could be suspicious. Attackers often use such methods for persistence or to escalate privileges.\n\nThere are also several registry changes from chrome.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes normally, multiple events might indicate something unusual, especially if they're modifying sensitive areas that could allow persistence or malicious configurations.\n\nThe latter part of the log has multiple entries indicating \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no associated process or file. This is concerning because it suggests some form of remote control or execution without clear context, which can be an indicator of command and control (C2) communication or remote attacks.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of legitimate activities like using powershell.exe for scripts and registry modifications by Chrome, but the combination—especially the file deletions after creation, scheduled task setup with calc.exe, and remote command executions—raises red flags. These could be signs of a potential attack or malicious activity trying to stay under the radar.\n\nSo, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because it combines elements that might indicate an ongoing or attempted security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including script execution and scheduled task creation with calc.exe, potential file deletions after creation, and remote command executions which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event shows WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's normal because WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and it's known for loading various DLLs like taskschd which handles task scheduling. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, I see three events with svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process that hosts various services, so these registry writes could be normal as part of service operations. But I'm not too sure if multiple writes in a short time might indicate something, though it's still within the realm of possible legitimate activity.\n\nThen there's an event where svchost creates a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. That path doesn't look immediately suspicious; it's under System32 which is standard. The filename \"unidade_comum\" translates to something like \"common unit,\" not obviously malicious.\n\nMoving on, there are two events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' with no file or process info. This is a bit concerning because remote command execution can be a sign of command-line attacks or remote access tools. However, without knowing the context, it's hard to say if this is malicious. Maybe it's part of legitimate remote management.\n\nThen there's an event from powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. PowerShell is commonly used for both good and bad purposes. The path seems standard for user profile data. But I know that sometimes attackers use PowerShell for lateral movement or execution, so this could be worth looking into.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event sets a registry value, which again is common but could indicate malicious activity if combined with other events.\n\nConhost.exe setting a registry value isn't too alarming on its own. Conhost is used by console applications, and changing registry values might be part of legitimate configuration.\n\nChrome.exe has several activities: loading DLLs like amsi.dll (which is anti-malware), MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is expected. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be normal if Chrome is updating settings, but multiple writes without cause might warrant attention.\n\nThen there are a bunch of DnsQuery events from chrome.exe. Browsers do this all the time for navigation, so nothing unusual here.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory seems routine as it's likely managing or rotating logs.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe creating another file called objeto_auxiliar.txt. The naming doesn't suggest anything malicious, but paired with other powershell activities, it might be part of a larger script or payload deployment.\n\nPutting it all together: there are some red flags like remote command execution and multiple registry writes from different processes. But many events seem normal for system operations. It's possible that these could indicate legitimate activity, but the combination of svchost.exe creating files in Task folder and multiple powershell actions might hint at potential malicious behavior. However, without more context or evidence of known indicators, I'm leaning towards it being not interesting but on the edge.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities with no clear signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
