Specifically, repeated queries of the registry (Disk Enum) using cmd.exe and reg.exe, coupled with process execution of systeminfo.exe, suggests an attacker is gathering system information.  The use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for execution is common.  Loading of DLLs like amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, and wmiutils.dll alongside other process access and creation events, indicates potentially malicious activity or attempts to evade detection. The winlogbeat activity suggests a potential configuration issue or an attacker attempting to establish persistence. While individual events may be benign, the aggregate raises concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
