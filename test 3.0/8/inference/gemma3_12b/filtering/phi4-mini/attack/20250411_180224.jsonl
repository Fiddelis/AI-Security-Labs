{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events related to `schtasks.exe` creating scheduled tasks with suspicious commands involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and non-existent scripts (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1). This indicates potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence. The creation of a scheduled task named 'win32times' further strengthens this concern. Multiple other processes (svchost.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe) are involved, suggesting broader operational activity, while the presence of downloaded software (winlogbeat) and text files may be related to the attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
