These scripts reference non-existent files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which suggests either an attempt at evasion or a misconfiguration.  The use of 'system' account for task creation is also noteworthy.  Additionally, the persistent execution of 'chrome.exe' and creation of files by 'winlogbeat.exe' is also present. The sequence of commands and registry modifications warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
