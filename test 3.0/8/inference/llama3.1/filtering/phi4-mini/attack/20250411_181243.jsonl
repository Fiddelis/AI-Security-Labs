For example, the presence of 'powershell.exe' with various command lines, including net user, get-localuser, and cmdkey.exe, suggests an attempt to elevate privileges or gather sensitive information. Additionally, the creation of multiple files in different directories may indicate a coordinated effort to maintain persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
