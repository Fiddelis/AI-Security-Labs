{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be okay, but notepad.exe modifying the registry could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. Then calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but if it's being loaded by calc.exe, maybe that's unusual. However, calc.exe is just the calculator, so maybe it's normal?\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line has schtasks \/create with names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The commands are setting up tasks to run calc.exe on logon and startup. That seems odd because creating scheduled tasks with random names might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. Also, the user might be trying to hide the tasks with non-English names, which could be a sign of evasion.\n\nThen, schtasks.exe is creating another task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with similar patterns. The paths mentioned in the file creation events are in the System32 directory, which is normal, but the task names are suspicious. Also, the use of \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" in the tasks is strange because calc.exe is a harmless application, but if it's being used as part of a larger malicious payload, that's a problem.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes. While svchost is a legitimate process, frequent registry changes could indicate something malicious. However, without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with suspicious names and the use of cmd.exe to launch calc.exe. These could be signs of an attacker setting up persistence. However, since calc.exe itself is a legitimate tool, it's possible that this is just normal user activity. But the combination of multiple task creations and the non-English names in the task names might indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity. The confidence here is moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they could also be benign. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, particularly around **scheduled task creation** and **potential persistence mechanisms**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Activity:\n1. **Malicious Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple `schtasks.exe` processes are creating tasks with obfuscated\/namespaced names (e.g., `\"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\"`, `\"pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\"`). These names suggest **evasion tactics** (e.g., using non-English characters or random suffixes to avoid detection).\n   - The tasks are configured to execute `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe` on system startup\/logon. While `calc.exe` is a benign utility, this pattern is **common in malware** for persistence, where attackers use legitimate tools as wrappers for malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Behavior**:\n   - `cmd.exe` is used to create tasks with suspicious command-line arguments, which is **unusual** for normal user activity and may indicate **manual or automated exploitation**.\n   - `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe` are modifying registry keys repeatedly. While `svchost` is a legitimate system process, **frequent registry changes** could signal **malware injection** or **tampering**.\n\n3. **File Creation in System Directories**:\n   - Files are being created in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\...`, which is a **common location for scheduled tasks**. However, the presence of tasks with obfuscated names raises concerns about **hidden persistence**.\n\n### Why This Is Interesting:\n- The combination of **scheduled task creation**, **obfuscated naming**, and **unusual process interactions** (e.g., `cmd.exe` launching `calc.exe`) aligns with **malware persistence patterns**.\n- The use of **non-English characters** in task names may indicate **evasion of automated detection systems** (e.g., signature-based tools).\n\n### Confidence Level:\n- **Moderate to High (0.7â€“0.8)**: While some activity (e.g., `chrome.exe` network traffic) is benign, the **scheduled task creation** and **registry modifications** are strong indicators of **malicious intent**. Further analysis (e.g., checking the actual contents of the tasks, inspecting registry changes, or correlating with other logs) is required to confirm.\n\n### Recommendation:\nInvestigate the **scheduled tasks** created (e.g., `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`) to check if they contain malicious payloads. Also, examine the **registry changes** made by `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe` for signs of **tampering** or **malware injection**."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are all performing registry value set operations. Some of these processes are normal, like svchost.exe and chrome.exe, but others like powershell.exe might be more concerning. However, just setting registry values isn't necessarily bad. It could be part of normal operations or updates.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe is accessing amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are security-related DLLs. Accessing them might be normal, but if it's done in an unusual way, it could be a red flag. However, looking at the task here, it's just \"Image loaded,\" which is a common event. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a file created event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal if it's part of setup. But maybe the user didn't install it, so that could be a sign of something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen, there's a file created by powershell.exe called unidade_ativo.txt. That's a text file, which might be benign, but if it's being created in a sensitive location or with unusual permissions, that could be an issue. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the process accesses: powershell.exe and chrome.exe are being accessed, but again, that's normal for these processes. The whoami.exe process is just checking the user, which is a standard command. \n\nNow, considering the repetition: chrome.exe is involved in a lot of registry changes. That's a lot of events. Maybe that's normal for chrome, but maybe not. Also, multiple registry value sets by different processes could indicate some kind of configuration change or malware trying to modify system settings.\n\nAnother thing is the use of powershell.exe. It's a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, in this batch, it's only creating a file and setting registry values. There's no indication of executing malicious scripts or downloading payloads here. \n\nThe presence of winlogbeat could be part of a monitoring setup, but if it's not expected, that might be a sign of an intrusion. However, the file created is a config file, which might be part of installation.\n\nPutting it all together: there are a lot of registry changes, some file creations, and normal processes. However, the high number of registry events by chrome.exe and the presence of winlogbeat might be worth investigating further. But without more context or indicators of compromise (like unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or unauthorized access), it's hard to say for sure. \n\nConfidence is medium. It's not extremely suspicious, but there are enough events that could be related to malicious activity to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events involving chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with file creation activities (e.g., winlogbeat config file and unidade_ativo.txt), suggest potential system configuration changes or data collection efforts. While some events are benign, the volume and combination of activities warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
