{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. There are several PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessed. The first few entries show 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. Then there's a 'Registry value set' event for svchost.exe, which might be normal, but then multiple PowerShell processes loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's interesting because those are part of the .NET runtime, but loading them through PowerShell could be part of a malicious script.\n\nWait, there's a command line in one of the entries that's taking a screenshot and saving it to the temp directory. That seems suspicious. Why would PowerShell be taking screenshots multiple times? Maybe it's part of an attack where they're capturing the screen for data exfiltration or to gather information about the environment. Also, the repeated loading of .NET assemblies might be an attempt to execute code or bypass security measures. The presence of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender is also a red flag because it's a security-related DLL; loading it might be an attempt to interfere with or bypass the antivirus.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes, loading .NET assemblies, screenshot commands, and the unusual registry activity could indicate a potential security threat. The confidence is high because these actions are not typical in normal operations and align with known attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are observed accessing\/creating processes, loading .NET assemblies (mscoree.dll, clr.dll), and executing screenshot commands to the temp directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries with PowerShell.exe. The command lines in some of them are using Add-Type to load the System.Windows.Forms assembly. Then they're capturing the screen using CopyFromScreen and saving it as a PNG file in the TEMP directory. That's a bit unusual because capturing the screen might be part of something like taking screenshots for malicious purposes, like stealing information or mapping the user's environment.\n\nNow, the filenames saved are things like \"estrutura_ativo.png\", \"modulo_principal.png\", etc. The fact that they're saving multiple screenshots with different names might indicate that the attacker is taking multiple screenshots, possibly to gather more data. However, just taking screenshots isn't necessarily malicious. But when combined with other events, it could be a sign.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a file created and then deleted, which might be part of a script that's temporary. Also, there's a Pipe Created event, which could be normal, but if paired with other suspicious activities, it might be a red flag. However, most of the other events are about registry changes, file creation, and process access, which are common in normal operations.\n\nThe key thing here is the repeated use of PowerShell to capture screenshots. While this could be part of a legitimate process (like a remote support tool), in the context of security logs, it's often associated with malicious activities. Attackers might use screen capture to steal sensitive information or to map the environment for further attacks. The multiple instances of this command line suggest that this isn't a one-off event but part of a pattern.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware execution, network activity, or unauthorized access. The logs don't show any obvious signs of data exfiltration or command and control communications. So, while the screenshots are suspicious, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But considering that the classification is about whether it's interesting for investigation, the presence of multiple screen captures via PowerShell is enough to flag it as interesting. The confidence is moderate because it's not definitive proof of a breach, but it's a behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands to capture screenshots using System.Windows.Forms and save them to the TEMP directory, which could indicate screen scraping for data exfiltration or reconnaissance.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, there are a couple of other events that stand out. \n\nLooking at the 9th event, there's an image loaded from 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll'. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading this DLL, that might be normal. But I should check if there's anything unusual here. \n\nThen, the 10th event shows an image loaded from 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll'. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender's real-time protection. Again, if this is a legitimate path, it's okay. But I need to verify if these paths are standard. \n\nWait, the paths here seem correct. However, the presence of multiple registry value sets might indicate some configuration changes. But chrome.exe typically doesn't modify the registry much. Maybe there's a malicious payload here. However, the events don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unexpected processes or network connections. \n\nThe other events are all registry modifications by chrome.exe. If this is a normal user activity, like updating settings, it's not a problem. But if this is part of a larger pattern, like evading detection, that's different. However, with the given data, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. \n\nHmm, but the combination of registry changes and loading specific DLLs might be worth investigating. Maybe the attacker is trying to hook into the antivirus components. However, without more context, like other events or indicators of compromise, it's hard to say. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. The events aren't overtly malicious, but the combination of registry modifications and loading known security-related DLLs could be a red flag. I should classify this as interesting but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe combined with loading of Windows Defender-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) may indicate attempts to interact with or bypass security mechanisms, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
