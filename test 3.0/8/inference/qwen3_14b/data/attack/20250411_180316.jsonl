Also, amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender, so loading that could be part of a bypass attempt.\n\nThen there's the 'cmd.exe' process with a command line that deletes notepad.exe processes using wmic. That seems suspicious. Deleting processes might be an attempt to remove something, but in this case, it's deleting notepad.exe, which is a normal process. However, the use of wmic and the command line structure could be part of a larger malicious activity. Also, the WMIC.exe process is being used here, which is known to be exploited in some attacks.\n\nAnother point is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the path and the .new extension could indicate a temporary file, which might not be immediately suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry changes, image loads of certain DLLs, and the use of cmd and wmic to delete processes. However, none of the events show clear signs of a successful attack or data exfiltration. The activities might be part of normal system operations or benign processes.

Chrome doing registry value sets might be normal, but maybe not. Then there's whoami.exe being executed, which is usually used to get the current user's identity. That could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe command that's copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's the Sticky Keys exploit, right? That's a classic method used in attacks to replace system files. Then there's a schtasks command deleting a task named win32times. That might be trying to remove evidence or a scheduled task that was part of the attack.\n\nAlso, the command_line for schtasks.exe shows deleting a task named \"win32times\" with the \/f flag, which forces deletion. That's suspicious. The presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, along with ProcessAccess for powershell.exe, could indicate someone trying to manipulate the system.\n\nThere's also a conhost.exe and svchost.exe involved in registry changes. While svchost is a normal system process, if it's making unexpected registry changes, that could be a red flag.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. The winlog tasks include Registry value set, Image loaded, Process accessed, and Process Create. Some of the files mentioned are system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. \n\nWait, the chrome.exe entries have Image loaded events pointing to amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. That's odd because those are legitimate system files, but maybe they're being loaded from unexpected locations? Let me check the paths. The first one is C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll, which is the correct path. The second one is from ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform... That's also a legitimate path for Defender's files. Hmm, maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there are a bunch of Registry value set events from cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. Changing registry values can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's modifying keys related to security or system settings. But without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to say. However, the fact that multiple processes are making registry changes might be suspicious.\n\nThere are also several Process accessed events for powershell.exe. Process access can indicate that another process is interacting with it, which might be part of a larger attack chain. Also, the command line for one of the whoami.exe processes is just \"whoami.exe\", which is normal, but the powershell.exe entries have commands like \"& {}\" which seems like a no-op. That might be a red flag if it's part of a script that's supposed to do something else but is being obfuscated.\n\nAnother thing is the File created event for a temporary script file in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The presence of a script file in Temp could be benign if it's part of a test, but if it's being created by a process that's not expected, like powershell.exe, it might be part of an attack. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes, process accesses, and a temporary script file. The use of PowerShell and CMD are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. The loading of legitimate system DLLs might not be suspicious on their own. However, the combination of multiple registry modifications and the creation of a temporary script could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code or bypass security policies. The confidence here is moderate because while some activities are suspicious, they could also be part of normal operations. But the presence of a script file in Temp and multiple registry changes might tip it towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several activities that could warrant further investigation, though they may not definitively indicate malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate System Components:**\n   - **`amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`** are legitimate Windows Defender components. Their loading by `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` is not inherently suspicious if the paths match expected locations (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll`).\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events are logged by `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. While registry changes are common in both benign and malicious contexts, **unusual or frequent modifications** (especially to security-related keys) could indicate an attempt to bypass protections or alter system behavior.\n\n3. **Process Access and Script Creation:**\n   - **`Process accessed`** events for `powershell.exe` might suggest interaction with other processes, which could be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., process injection).\n   - A **temporary PowerShell script** (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. While temporary files are common, the name `PSScriptPolicyTest` may hint at **script execution testing** or **bypassing execution policies** (e.g., via `Bypass` mode in PowerShell).\n\n4. **PowerShell Image Loads:**\n   - Multiple **`Image loaded`** events for .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are logged. These are normal for PowerShell, but the **volume of logs** or **unusual timing** could raise flags.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Unusual Registry Activity:** Frequent or unexpected registry modifications by `cmd.exe`\/`powershell.exe` could indicate attempts to disable security features (e.g., modifying `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender`).\n- **Script Execution in Temp:** The creation of a script in `Temp` may be part of **malicious payload execution** or **evasion techniques** (e.g., obfuscating scripts to avoid detection).\n- **PowerShell Usage:** While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in conjunction with registry changes and script creation could suggest **post-exploitation activities** (e.g., persistence, data exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **normal system behavior** (e.g., legitimate DLL loading) but also **potentially suspicious patterns** (e.g., registry changes, script creation). These activities could be **benign** (e.g., system updates, user-initiated scripts) or **malicious** (e.g., lateral movement, persistence). \n\n**Recommendation:** Further investigation is warranted, including:\n- Correlating these events with **user behavior** (e.g., did the user run scripts?).\n- Checking **registry key modifications** for signs of tampering.\n- Analyzing the **content of the temporary script** (if accessible).\n- Reviewing **network activity** around the time of these events for data exfiltration.\n\n**Confidence Level:** Moderate (interesting for investigation, but not conclusive of malicious intent)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a file deletion event involving a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because temporary files being deleted could be part of a cleanup after an attack.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be normal operations, but the repetition could indicate something automated. However, the command lines here are just \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems like empty commands. Maybe they're placeholders or part of some logging mechanism.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files by PowerShell, like the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be normal user activity, but combined with the deletion, it's suspicious. Also, there are several PowerShell processes checking for the existence of various .bat files in different paths. These paths have some odd naming conventions with terms like \"modulo_geral\" and \"estrutura_comum,\" which might be obfuscation or part of a script that's trying to locate specific files. The fact that they're checking multiple paths could indicate a search for a payload or a way to execute a script if certain files exist.\n\nThe presence of \"whoami.exe\" is normal, but the repeated PowerShell events with those specific paths and the deletion of a script in the Temp folder make me think there might be some malicious activity. However, without more context like network traffic or other anomalies, it's a bit hard to be certain.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The first event shows a PowerShell script checking if a certain file exists. The command line has paths like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\...\" and exits based on whether the file exists. That seems normal, maybe part of a script's validation.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell. The image loads include .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's typical for PowerShell running scripts, especially if it's using .NET assemblies. But the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be a red flag. Why would PowerShell load Defender DLLs? Maybe it's a legitimate check, but sometimes malware uses legitimate processes to hide.\n\nThere's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do this to avoid leaving traces. However, the fact that it's immediately deleted might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events from chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry multiple times could indicate something like a browser extension being installed or a configuration change. But if it's part of normal Chrome operations, it might not be a problem. However, if the registry changes are unexpected or numerous, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of similar PowerShell commands checking different paths. The paths have patterns like \"modulo_ativo\", \"modulo_logico\", which might be part of a naming convention, but the fact that they're checking for scripts in various locations could be part of a larger process. Maybe the scripts are being executed in different directories, or checking for existence before running.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event for PowerShell might be normal, but pipes can sometimes be used for inter-process communication in attacks. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, the presence of multiple PowerShell events, loading of Defender DLLs, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry changes from Chrome might indicate some suspicious activity. However, some of these could be benign. The key is whether these activities are part of a larger pattern that's not typical. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I need to rely on the logs.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch shows a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The PowerShell scripts and the interaction with Defender DLLs might be worth investigating further. The registry changes from Chrome could also be a point of concern. However, without more data, it's a bit ambiguous. I'd say it's moderately suspicious, so maybe a 0.6 confidence level. But I should check if there's any clear indicators of compromise. The fact that the temporary script is created and deleted quickly might be a sign, but it could also be part of a legitimate process. Overall, it's not a clear-cut case, but there are enough points to consider it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Activity:**\n   - Multiple `PowerShell.exe` processes execute scripts checking for the existence of `.bat` files in specific paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_ativo\\...`). These scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on the file's presence, which may be part of validation logic or preparatory steps for larger operations.\n   - The paths (`modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`, etc.) suggest a naming convention, possibly related to application modules or logical components, but the repeated checks for scripts in different directories could indicate a broader process (e.g., deployment, configuration, or runtime checks).\n\n2. **Suspicious File Activity:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell` directory and immediately deleted. While temporary script creation is common, the rapid deletion might be an attempt to avoid detection, though this could also be a legitimate diagnostic or policy test.\n\n3. **Windows Defender DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell loads `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components). While this could be part of a legitimate security check, it is unusual for PowerShell to directly interact with Defender DLLs unless explicitly required. This might warrant further investigation to confirm legitimacy.\n\n4. **Chrome Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events from `chrome.exe` suggest Chrome is modifying its own configuration. While this is normal for extensions or updates, the high frequency (10+ events) could indicate an unusual or malicious configuration change, especially if tied to unexpected behavior (e.g., data exfiltration, persistence).\n\n5. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `Pipe Created` event for PowerShell is neutral but could be used for inter-process communication, which is sometimes exploited in attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** **Moderate**  \n  The combination of PowerShell scripting, temporary file creation\/deletion, and Chrome registry changes raises concerns. However, some activities (e.g., Defender DLL loading, script validation) could be legitimate.\n- **Confidence Level:** **0.6 (60%)**  \n  The logs are not definitively malicious but contain enough anomalies to warrant further investigation (e.g., checking the contents of the deleted script, analyzing Chrome's registry changes, and correlating with other system events).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Deleted Script:**  \n   - Check if the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) was ever present in the file system (e.g., via memory analysis or residual logs).\n   - Analyze the script's content if recovered to determine its purpose.\n\n2. **Audit Chrome's Registry Changes:**  \n   - Verify if the registry modifications are associated with known Chrome extensions or updates. Unusual changes (e.g., adding hooks for data collection) could indicate compromise.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Activity:**  \n   - Correlate the PowerShell events with other system logs (e.g., process tree, network connections) to identify if these scripts are part of a larger operation.\n\n4. **Check for Defender Interactions:**  \n   - Confirm if the loading of Defender DLLs by PowerShell is part of a legitimate security workflow or if it's being used to bypass detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe logs are **interesting for further investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell scripting, temporary file manipulation, and Chrome registry changes. While not conclusive evidence of a threat, these patterns merit closer scrutiny to rule out malicious intent."}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are related to powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Now, checking the winlog tasks. There are several entries with 'Registry value set' and 'Process Create', which might be normal, but the repetition could indicate something. \n\nWait, there's a command_line in one of the entries. Let me check that. The command_line shows New-Item creating a file and then Set-Content writing \"dir\" into another file. That seems suspicious because creating and modifying files in various directories might be part of an attack, like setting up backdoors or exfiltrating data. \n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs. While some of these are legitimate system files, the presence of several .dll files from Microsoft .NET might be normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it could indicate a malicious payload being executed.\n\nThen there are several entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but when combined with file creation and registry changes, it's a pattern that's often seen in attacks. \n\nThe 'File created' event in the Temp directory is another point. Malware often writes temporary files, so that's a common tactic. \n\nPutting this all together: repeated PowerShell activities, creating files in various locations, loading .NET assemblies, and writing to temporary files. These are all indicators of potentially malicious behavior. Even though some actions could be legitimate, the combination and frequency here make it look like a security incident. \n\nSo, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence. The justification is the suspicious PowerShell commands, multiple file creations, and loading of .NET DLLs which are common in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, indicating a **high likelihood of a security incident**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Indicators of Concern:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands like `New-Item` (creating files) and `Set-Content` (writing \"dir\" to files). This pattern is often used to **persist malicious payloads** or **exfiltrate data**.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     New-Item \"C:\\...\\modulo_base_script.bat\" -Force | Out-Null\n     Set-Content -Path \"C:\\...\\componente_comum_script.bat\" -Value \"dir\"\n     ```\n     This could indicate **file-based persistence** or **command-and-control (C2) communication**.\n\n2. **File Creation in Suspicious Locations**:\n   - A file is created in the **Windows Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`), a common tactic for malware to **hide temporary files**.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Manipulation**:\n   - Multiple **\"Registry value set\"** and **\"File created\"** events suggest **system modification**, which could be part of **privilege escalation** or **disabling security controls**.\n\n4. **Loading of .NET Assemblies**:\n   - Events like **\"Image loaded\"** for `.dll` files (e.g., `mscorlib.dll`, `System.Core.dll`) are normal for PowerShell, but **combined with the above**, they may indicate **exploitation of .NET-based payloads** (e.g., obfuscated scripts, malicious assemblies).\n\n5. **Unusual Task Names**:\n   - Entries with **\"Provider Lifecycle\"** and **\"Engine Lifecycle\"** tasks are internal PowerShell events, but their repetition alongside file\/registry changes raises concerns about **malicious scripting** or **exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs show **patterns consistent with adversarial activity**, such as **file persistence, registry manipulation, and .NET-based execution**. While some actions (e.g., PowerShell usage, .NET DLLs) are legitimate, their **combination and frequency** here strongly suggest **malicious intent**.\n\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING**  \n**Confidence Level**: **High**  \n**Recommendation**: Investigate further by analyzing the contents of the created files, checking for unauthorized registry changes, and correlating with network traffic for C2 activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There's a file deletion, some file creations, image loads, and registry changes. The file paths mentioned are in temporary directories or user-specific locations, which might be normal, but I should check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the first event: a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 is deleted. That's a temporary script file, maybe part of a normal process. But then there are multiple file creations in different directories. The command lines show PowerShell scripts that create files and check if certain paths exist. \n\nWait, some of the command lines have paths like \"C:\\\\registro_secundario\\\\unidade_secundario\\\\..\\\\elemento_comum\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" in the path could indicate trying to access parent directories, which might be a way to navigate to other parts of the filesystem. That's a red flag sometimes, but not always malicious.\n\nThere are several image loads from .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard for PowerShell when running scripts, so that's probably normal. However, the repeated use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but I need to check if they're being used in an unusual way.\n\nRegistry value sets are also present, but without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. The fact that multiple events are from PowerShell, which is often used by attackers, but also by legitimate processes. \n\nThe key thing here is the combination of events. There's a mix of file operations, registry changes, and image loads. However, none of the events seem to indicate a clear attack vector like downloading malicious files, connecting to external IPs, or executing suspicious commands. The scripts are creating and checking files, which could be part of a legitimate automation task or a more malicious activity.\n\nBut since all the events are within the system's normal operations and don't show any obvious signs of compromise, like unauthorized access or data exfiltration, it's possible that this is just regular PowerShell usage. However, the presence of multiple file creations and path manipulations might warrant further investigation to ensure there's no hidden malicious activity. \n\nI think the answer here is that while the logs show typical PowerShell activities, the lack of clear malicious indicators makes it not highly suspicious. But maybe the user should look into the specific scripts and their purposes for more certainty.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show a series of **PowerShell-related activities** involving file operations, registry changes, and .NET assembly loads. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **File Operations**:\n   - **File Deletion**: A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) is deleted. This is common during script execution or cleanup.\n   - **File Creation**: Multiple files (e.g., `componente_secundario_script.bat`, `pacote_temporario_script.bat`) are created in non-standard paths. While this could be part of legitimate automation, the use of relative paths (e.g., `..`) might indicate attempts to traverse directories, which could be suspicious if unrelated to the script's intended purpose.\n\n2. **PowerShell Script Behavior**:\n   - Scripts frequently check for the existence of files (e.g., `Test-Path`) and exit with `0` or `1`. This is typical for validation logic but could also be part of a larger process (e.g., pre-checks before deployment or execution).\n\n3. **.NET Assembly Loads**:\n   - Numerous `.dll` files (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are loaded. These are standard for PowerShell when executing scripts, so this is expected behavior.\n\n4. **Registry Changes**:\n   - Registry value modifications are logged but lack context. Without additional data (e.g., specific keys or values altered), it is difficult to assess their legitimacy.\n\n5. **No Clear Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No evidence of **external network activity**, **unauthorized access**, **data exfiltration**, or **execution of malicious payloads** is present.\n   - All events appear to be **system-internal operations**, possibly related to script execution or configuration management.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs **do not contain clear evidence of a security incident**. The activities appear to be **legitimate PowerShell operations**, possibly related to script execution, file management, or system configuration. However, the **repetitive file checks and path manipulations** could warrant further investigation to confirm the scripts' intent and ensure no hidden malicious behavior is occurring.\n\n**Verdict**: **Low suspicion**—no immediate threat detected, but context (e.g., script content, user intent) would improve confidence in the benign nature of these activities."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist using Test-Path. For example, the first event checks for \"C:\\modulo_geral\\...\" and exits with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. This pattern repeats multiple times with different file paths. \n\nNow, why would someone do that? Well, checking for the existence of a file could be a benign action, like a script verifying dependencies. But in the context of cybersecurity, this might be part of a larger malicious activity. For instance, an attacker might be checking for the presence of a specific file to determine if their payload has already been executed or if certain conditions are met before proceeding.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to stage files. However, the fact that it's deleted afterward might be an attempt to clean up traces. But in this case, the file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which sounds like it could be part of a legitimate PowerShell script testing process, maybe related to execution policy checks. However, the repeated Test-Path commands might be more suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These are part of the Windows Event Log system, and they might indicate that the PowerShell processes are being monitored or managed by some system component. However, the repetition of these checks across different paths could be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"..\\\" in the file paths. This is a directory traversal, which is often used in attacks to access files outside the intended directory. For example, in the first event, the path is \"C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..\\\" which would resolve to \"C:\\modulo_geral\\\". But if the script is checking for a file in a parent directory, that might be intentional or could be a way to access files outside the current directory structure, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these could be part of legitimate software operations. For example, scripts that need to check for the presence of certain binaries or configuration files. But the sheer number of these Test-Path commands across various paths might indicate automated probing, which is more typical of malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple Registry value set events could indicate changes to the system's registry, which is another common method used by malware to persist or modify system behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say if these are benign or malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of Test-Path with directory traversal and the multiple PowerShell events might be indicative of a probing phase by an attacker, checking for the presence of files or conditions before executing further malicious actions. However, without seeing the actual payloads or more context, it's a bit of a judgment call. But given the patterns observed, it's leaning towards being suspicious and warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation due to potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) commonly associated with malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive `Test-Path` Commands in PowerShell:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like:\n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\[path]\\..\\\"{exit 0} else {exit 1}\n     ```\n   - **Directory Traversal (`..`):** The use of `..` in file paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..`) suggests attempts to traverse directory structures, which may be used to access files outside the intended scope or probe for sensitive files.\n   - **Purpose Unclear:** While `Test-Path` is a legitimate command, its repetition across unrelated paths raises suspicion of automated probing (e.g., checking for existence of binaries, configuration files, or payloads).\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A transient file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is created and deleted in the Temp directory. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate Script Testing:** PowerShell execution policy checks or temporary script execution.\n     - **Malicious Behavior:** Staging files for execution or cleanup of artifacts.\n\n3. **Event Log Tasks (\"Provider\/Engine Lifecycle\"):**\n   - PowerShell processes are tied to \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which are part of Windows Event Log system operations. While not inherently malicious, their pairing with the above patterns may indicate:\n     - **Monitoring or Automation:** The processes might be part of a larger automated workflow, potentially for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple \"Registry value set\" events are logged, which could indicate:\n     - **Persistence Mechanisms:** Malware often modifies registry keys to ensure persistence across reboots.\n     - **Legitimate Software:** However, the lack of context makes this ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Suspicious Patterns:** The combination of directory traversal, repetitive file existence checks, and registry modifications aligns with behaviors seen in **reconnaissance phases** of attacks (e.g., checking for existing payloads, probing for vulnerabilities, or determining system state).\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimacy:** While individual components (e.g., `Test-Path`, Temp file operations) are common in legitimate scripts, their **frequency** and **context** (e.g., unrelated paths, lack of clear purpose) suggest a higher risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Data:**\n   - Check for associated processes, network activity, or file modifications to confirm intent (e.g., does the script communicate with external servers?).\n   - Investigate the source of the PowerShell commands (e.g., are they initiated by user activity or scheduled tasks?).\n\n2. **Monitor for Persistence:**\n   - Audit registry changes and check for scheduled tasks or startup items that could be linked to the observed PowerShell activity.\n\n3. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Use antivirus\/EDR tools to scan for known malicious payloads or behaviors tied to the observed file paths.\n\n4. **Review Execution Policies:**\n   - Ensure PowerShell execution policies (e.g., `Restricted`, `RemoteSigned`) are configured to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events are not definitively malicious, the **repetitive probing behavior**, **directory traversal**, and **registry modifications** are **highly suspicious** and merit further investigation. This could indicate either:\n- **Malicious Activity:** Early-stage reconnaissance or payload deployment.\n- **Misconfigured Scripts:** Legitimate processes with poor security practices (e.g., untrusted scripts using `Test-Path` for unintended purposes).\n\n**Action Required:** Immediate forensic analysis and correlation with additional logs\/endpoint data to determine intent."}

So, first, looking at the events, there are a bunch of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessed. The first event has a command line that checks if a specific file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so maybe just part of PowerShell's normal operation. But then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts to use temporary files. However, the fact that it's created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. \n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of PowerShell with commands that check for the existence of certain executable files. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\registro_ativo\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_comum.exe\" don't look standard. They have a lot of Portuguese-sounding terms, which might be obfuscation or just part of the application's naming. But if those files aren't typical system files, that could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user identity, but combined with other PowerShell activities, maybe it's part of a larger operation. The cmd.exe process is checking for a file in the temp directory, which again is a common tactic for scripts to check for existence.\n\nHowever, I don't see any obvious malicious activities like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying system settings. The events are mostly about process creation, accessing, and loading images. The presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be normal, but could also be part of an evasion technique.\n\nConsidering all this, the repeated checks for specific files and the use of temporary files might be part of a legitimate script, but the lack of clear benign context and the non-standard file paths could indicate something suspicious. However, without more context like network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit inconclusive. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because there are some suspicious elements but not definitive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing path existence checks for non-standard file paths (e.g., 'registro_ativo', 'objeto_logico.txt'), combined with temporary file creation\/deletion patterns and repeated process access events, suggest potential script-based activity that may be obfuscating malicious behavior or probing system state.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system events. My job is to figure out if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the events and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' entries. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it might be suspicious. The winlog tasks include things like 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. The 'Image loaded' events mention specific DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so loading them is normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET. But why so many of them?\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'Process Create' for 'whoami.exe', which is a legitimate command to get user info, but if it's being called repeatedly, maybe that's a red flag. However, in this case, it's just a couple of times. \n\nThe command lines for PowerShell are interesting. They all have a similar structure: checking if a certain file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned like 'C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar...' don't look like standard system paths. They seem custom, which might indicate that the attacker is checking for the presence of specific files, possibly part of a larger attack or payload. \n\nAlso, the 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks with PowerShell commands checking various paths might be part of a script that's trying to determine the environment or look for specific files. The repetition of similar commands across different paths could be a sign of automated probing or checking for the presence of certain components. \n\nHowever, all the events are related to normal system processes and legitimate operations. The PowerShell commands are not executing malicious code directly, just checking for files. The image loads are part of the .NET runtime, which is expected when running PowerShell scripts that use .NET. \n\nBut the fact that there are multiple checks for different file paths might be part of an attacker's reconnaissance phase. They could be trying to see if certain files exist to determine the system's configuration or to locate where they can deploy payloads. However, without more context, like unusual network activity, unexpected services, or other malicious binaries, it's hard to say for sure. \n\nOn the other hand, the logs don't show any obvious signs of exploitation or data exfiltration. All the events are within normal system operations. The user might be overthinking it, but the combination of multiple PowerShell checks and the non-standard file paths could be worth investigating further. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think this is a moderate risk. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the patterns are suspicious enough to warrant a closer look. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Frequency of PowerShell Usage:**\n   - **Over 20 entries** involve `powershell.exe`, often with commands checking for the existence of custom file paths (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\src\\unidade_principal.cs`). These paths are **non-standard** and appear to be part of a custom or application-specific directory structure, which is unusual in typical system operations.\n\n2. **.NET Framework DLL Loads:**\n   - Multiple **\"Image loaded\" events** reference .NET-related DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). While these are legitimate for PowerShell scripts leveraging .NET, their **repetition** could indicate an attempt to execute complex or obfuscated scripts.\n\n3. **Repetitive File-Path Checks:**\n   - PowerShell commands repeatedly use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files in **custom directories** (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\...`). This behavior may suggest:\n     - **Reconnaissance** (e.g., probing for specific files or directories).\n     - **Conditional execution** of payloads based on file presence (e.g., a staged attack).\n\n4. **\"Provider Lifecycle\" Events:**\n   - Several entries with **\"Provider Lifecycle\"** tasks involve PowerShell scripts with similar structures. These could be part of a **scripting framework** or **custom tooling**, but their repetitive nature raises questions about their purpose.\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The custom paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\...`) are not typical system directories, which could indicate **malicious activity** or **custom malware**.\n- **Lack of Clear Malicious Payloads:** While the scripts themselves do not directly execute malicious code (e.g., no `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, or `Start-Process` commands), their repetitive checks may be **preparatory steps** for further exploitation.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Benign Activity:** Moderate. PowerShell is a legitimate tool, and checking file paths is a common administrative task.\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** Low to moderate. The **custom paths**, **repetitive checks**, and **unusual event frequency** suggest a need for further scrutiny, especially if correlated with other anomalies (e.g., network traffic, unauthorized user activity).\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains) or **file modifications** in the custom directories.\n   - Investigate **user context** (e.g., who executed these commands and from where).\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell transcript logging** or **script block logging** to inspect the actual commands executed (if enabled).\n\n3. **Monitor for Follow-On Activity:**\n   - Watch for **unusual file creation**, **registry changes**, or **process injection** that might follow these checks.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **moderately suspicious** due to the repetitive, custom file-path checks and the high volume of PowerShell activity. While no direct malicious payload is evident, this behavior could be part of a **reconnaissance phase** or **staged attack**. Further investigation is recommended to rule out compromise. \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** (likely benign but warrants deeper analysis)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions the Image loaded for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal. Then there's a File created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack, like dropping a malicious script and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might indicate something malicious. Then there are several events where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The name \"Get-Keystrokes\" sounds suspicious because that could be related to keylogging, which is a common malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple instances of PowerShell processes checking paths in various directories, all looking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Even though the command lines are just checking if the file exists and exiting, the repeated attempts across different paths might be trying to locate a script that's been placed somewhere. The fact that they're using Test-Path and exiting based on that could be part of a larger script that's trying to execute the keystroke logger if found.\n\nAlso, some of the command lines have escaped quotes, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the command. The registry events and process access events might be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But the repeated attempts to access Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different locations, along with the file creation and deletion, do point towards potential malicious activity.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the files mentioned are part of Windows Defender, which is legitimate. The Temp files being created and deleted could be part of normal operations, but the combination with the keystroke-related scripts makes me lean towards it being interesting. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution, but the patterns are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A file is created (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`) and then deleted shortly after. This pattern is often used to **drop and execute malicious payloads** (e.g., scripts) while avoiding detection.\n\n2. **Repetitive Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes repeatedly check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in various directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`, `C:\\objeto_temporario\\...`). \n   - **\"Get-Keystrokes\"** is a strong indicator of **keylogging malware**, which is commonly used to steal sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credentials).\n\n3. **Obfuscation in Command Lines:**\n   - Escaped quotes (`\\\"`) and inconsistent formatting in command lines (e.g., `& {if (Test-Path \\\"\\\"C:\\\\...\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\"\\\"\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}`) suggest **attempts to obfuscate or evade detection**.\n\n4. **Unusual Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `Pipe Created` event is logged, which could indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)** for data exfiltration or coordination between malicious processes.\n\n5. **Registry and Process Access Events:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` events may indicate **attempts to modify system settings** or **establish persistence** (e.g., adding registry keys to autorun malicious code).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity:**\n- **Legitimate:** \n  - Some files (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`) are part of **Windows Defender**, which is normal.\n  - Temp file creation\/deletion can occur during **benign operations** (e.g., software updates).\n- **Suspicious:**\n  - The **repetitive, targeted checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** across non-standard paths are highly unusual and align with **malware behavior**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **multiple red flags** (e.g., keylogging indicators, obfuscation, and suspicious file operations) that suggest **potential malicious activity**. While further analysis (e.g., checking file contents, network traffic, user context) is needed to confirm, this batch **definitely warrants investigation**.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High (75-85%) – The behavior is consistent with malware patterns, though not definitively malicious without additional evidence."}

So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve PowerShell.exe. There are several instances of ImageLoad events, which are normal because PowerShell often loads various DLLs. But I should check if any of the loaded files are suspicious. The paths mentioned include standard system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Those seem legitimate. However, there's one entry where a file is created and then immediately deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are the command lines from PowerShell. The first one checks if a certain script exists and exits with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned, like C:\\tarefa_temporario\\..., don't look like standard system paths. The second command line has a similar structure but with a different path. These might be testing if certain scripts are present, which could be part of a larger attack plan.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in the paths. That name sounds suspicious because it could be related to keylogging, which is malicious. However, just the name doesn't confirm it's malicious. But combined with the fact that the scripts are being checked for existence, it might be part of an attack.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for a winlogbeat configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a new config file might be normal if someone is setting it up, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the rest of the events don't indicate any obvious malicious activity beyond the PowerShell scripts.\n\nThe other processes like whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe don't show any suspicious activity. The RegistryEvent entries are normal for these processes.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and the presence of a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 might indicate something worth investigating. However, without more evidence like actual malicious code execution or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough indicators to warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **mixed indicators** that warrant further investigation but do not definitively confirm malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Frequent `ProcessAccess` and `ImageLoad` events** for PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) are common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., scripting, automation). However:\n     - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is **created and immediately deleted**. This pattern is often seen in **malicious payloads** to avoid detection or test execution paths.\n     - Command-line arguments in PowerShell (e.g., checking for existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`) suggest **script probing**. While `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` could be a benign script, the name is suspicious and may hint at **keylogging or data exfiltration** (though not conclusive without further context).\n\n2. **Suspicious Script Names**:\n   - The presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in the paths (even as a hypothetical target) raises concerns. While not inherently malicious, such names are often used in **malware frameworks** (e.g., Cobalt Strike) to obfuscate intent.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Configuration File**:\n   - A new `.yml.new` file is created for **Winlogbeat** (a log shipper). This could be part of **legitimate configuration changes**, but the lack of context (e.g., no prior logs about the configuration) makes it worth verifying.\n\n4. **Benign Processes**:\n   - Other processes (`whoami.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, `svchost.exe`) show no anomalous activity. `RegistryEvent` entries for these processes are typical for system operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Potential Concern**\n- **File creation\/deletion**: The temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is a **low-confidence indicator** of malicious behavior (e.g., staged attacks, evasion).\n- **Script probing**: The PowerShell commands checking for script existence may indicate **preparation for lateral movement or data exfiltration**.\n- **Suspicious script name**: `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a **high-risk name** in the context of PowerShell activity, though not conclusive on its own.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Classification**: **Suspicious but not confirmed malicious**.\n- **Recommendation**: \n  - Correlate these events with **network traffic logs** (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections) to check for C2 activity.\n  - Inspect the contents of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` (if accessible) for malicious code.\n  - Monitor for **repeated probing** of similar scripts or files.\n- **Confidence Level**: **Medium** (requires further context to confirm malicious intent).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe events show **potential signs of suspicious activity** (e.g., file probing, temporary script creation) but lack conclusive evidence of a confirmed threat. Further investigation is recommended. \n\n**Answer:** `Suspicious` ✅"}
