{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a list of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events to see what's happening. There are several entries involving 'schtasks.exe' creating scheduled tasks. For example, one event shows the command line for schtasks creating a task that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass, which is a common technique to bypass execution policies. The script paths mentioned, like c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, might be non-existent, which could indicate a red flag since the attacker might be trying to execute a script that doesn't exist, possibly as part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's a 'powershell.exe' process being created multiple times, which is normal, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it could be part of an attempt to establish persistence. The 'cmd.exe' processes are also involved in creating these tasks. \n\nLooking at the other events, there's a 'svchost.exe' accessing the registry multiple times, which might be normal, but the repetition could be suspicious. However, svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so it's not necessarily malicious on its own. \n\nThere are also events related to 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files, which might be part of log collection, but not inherently malicious. The 'chrome.exe' entries are all related to registry value sets, but since Chrome is a common application, this might not be significant unless there's a pattern of unusual activity. \n\nThe key points here are the scheduled tasks created with PowerShell scripts using bypass parameters, which are often used in attacks to execute malicious code. The presence of multiple schtasks.exe and powershell.exe events, along with the command-line arguments, suggests a possible attempt to set up persistence or execute scripts. \n\nHowever, some of the script paths mentioned don't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1), which might be a red herring or part of a failed attack. But the combination of creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges (running as system) and using PowerShell with bypass could be a sign of malicious activity. \n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities, like file creation in unusual locations or unexpected network activity. From the given data, the main suspicious elements are the scheduled tasks and the use of PowerShell with bypass. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch does show some potentially malicious behavior, but there are also normal processes. The confidence level might be around 0.7 because while there are indicators of compromise, they might not be conclusive on their own without more context. However, the presence of scheduled tasks with malicious command-line arguments is a strong indicator, so maybe higher. I'll go with 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Suspicious\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled task creations via schtasks.exe with PowerShell scripts using -ep bypass (common in attacks to bypass execution policies).
