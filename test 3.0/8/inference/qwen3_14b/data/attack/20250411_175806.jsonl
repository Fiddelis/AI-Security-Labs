{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed or creating files. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. Then there's whoami.exe, which is usually benign but can be part of a larger malicious script. \n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries, one of them has a command line that adds a registry entry under Run, pointing to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\". That seems suspicious because adding a registry entry in the Run key is a common method for persistence. The command line uses REG ADD, which is a legitimate tool, but the path mentioned (C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe) doesn't look standard. Also, there's another reg.exe process adding another entry, \"entrada_principal\" pointing to \"C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe\". Both of these could be part of an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt'. Not sure if that's malicious, but the presence of a file creation event might be normal. However, the same path is mentioned again for winlogbeat.yml.new, which might be related to a legitimate tool (Winlogbeat), but creating a .yml.new file could be part of a configuration change or an attack.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell and CMD to modify the registry, along with creating files, might indicate someone trying to set up persistence or execute commands. The fact that multiple registry entries are added in the Run key suggests the attacker wants the malware to run automatically on startup. Also, the presence of both 'estrutura_principal.exe' and 'pacote_temporario.exe' in the paths could be part of a larger malicious payload.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be false positives. For example, the winlogbeat file creation might be part of a legitimate configuration change. But the combination of registry modifications, multiple process creations, and the use of PowerShell and CMD for these actions raises a red flag. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the events do show suspicious behavior that could be part of a cyberattack. The confidence is high enough to classify this as interesting, but not 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated use of PowerShell and CMD to modify registry Run keys (potential persistence mechanism), creation of non-standard executable paths in registry, and file creation events in user downloads directory. These patterns align with common attack techniques for establishing persistence and executing payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
