{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. Multiple network connections might be part of regular browsing, but maybe if there's an unusual pattern, but here it's just repeated entries. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe involved. The first interesting thing is the command_line in one of the entries: it's using Start-Process to run a batch file. The path is a bit long and has some directory traversals like \"..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". That might be a red flag because using relative paths with multiple dots could be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path. But I need to check if that's common or if it's a known legitimate practice.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoaded events for powershell.exe. The files loaded include .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal. However, there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe if it's being loaded in an unexpected context, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a FileCreated and FileDeleted event for a temporary script file. Creating and deleting a script in the Temp directory could be part of normal operations, but if it's being used to execute something malicious, that's a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the command_line entries again, there are several instances where powershell.exe is starting processes with batch files. The paths have a pattern: they all seem to be in directories like \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\" which might be trying to access parent directories. This could be a way to bypass path restrictions or to hide the actual location. However, sometimes legitimate scripts use such paths, so it's not conclusive.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of the same task names like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but if they're occurring in a high frequency or in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that could be a problem. However, in this case, there's not enough data to confirm that.\n\nThe presence of ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry is normal for some applications, but again, without more context, it's hard to say if it's a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the multiple PowerShell processes launching batch files with obfuscated paths and the temporary script file being created and deleted. However, these could be part of legitimate software operations. Without more evidence like unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or known malicious payloads, it's a bit ambiguous. But since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, the answer would be yes, because there are indicators that warrant further examination, even if they aren't definitive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several **suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitive proof of malicious intent. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **PowerShell Command-Line Activity**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing batch files with **obfuscated paths** (e.g., `C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\...`), which may be an attempt to **hide the actual file path** or bypass path-based security checks. While not inherently malicious, this is a common tactic in attacks.\n\n2. **Temporary Script File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted in the `%TEMP%` directory. This pattern is often seen in **malware execution or payload delivery**, as attackers may use such files to execute malicious code without leaving persistent traces.\n\n3. **Repetitive \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - PowerShell processes are repeatedly associated with **\"Provider Lifecycle\"** and **\"Engine Lifecycle\"** events. While these can be normal in some contexts (e.g., COM object interactions), their frequency and association with obfuscated paths may indicate **unusual or automated behavior**.\n\n4. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - The batch files executed (e.g., `modulo_logico_script.bat`, `unidade_principal_script.bat`) have **non-standard, nested paths** that deviate from typical application structures. This could suggest **custom or obfuscated scripts**.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal Activity**:\n- **Chrome.exe** performing DNS queries and network connections is typical for a browser.\n- **.NET DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and **Windows Defender components** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`) being loaded are expected in legitimate .NET and security-related operations.\n- **ApplicationFrameHost.exe** modifying the registry is common for some Windows applications.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis batch of logs **merits further investigation** due to:\n- **Obfuscated paths** in PowerShell commands.\n- **Temporary script file creation\/deletion** in `%TEMP%`.\n- **Repetitive lifecycle events** tied to PowerShell processes.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Correlate these events with **network traffic** (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections) to check for C2 activity.\n- Analyze the **batch files** (if accessible) for malicious content.\n- Check for **unauthorized user activity** or **privilege escalation**.\n- Monitor for **repeated use of temporary files** or **unusual process spawning**.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** â€” the logs contain indicators that could signal benign or malicious activity, requiring deeper analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe. The majority are chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Now, chrome.exe doing a lot of registry value sets might be normal, but maybe not. Let me check the specifics.\n\nWait, there's a command line in one of the processes: powershell.exe executing a script that starts another batch file. The path is \"C:\\estrutura_logico\\registro_temporario\\..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". Hmm, the path has \"..\\\" which might be a directory traversal, but not necessarily malicious. However, the presence of a script being executed via PowerShell could be a red flag, especially if it's modifying the registry or creating files.\n\nAnother thing is the file paths. There's a file created at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_principal.txt\" by powershell.exe. Creating files in the Downloads folder isn't unusual, but combined with other events, maybe.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, so that might be odd. However, some legitimate activities could involve registry changes. But if it's excessive, that's a concern.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events: chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's normal. Similarly, urlmon.dll is a standard DLL. So those are probably benign.\n\nThere's also a process accessed event for powershell.exe. Maybe that's just part of normal operations, but if it's being accessed in a way that's not typical, that could be an issue.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. The presence of PowerShell executing scripts, multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, and file creation in user directories might be indicative of something. However, without more context, like the actual content of the scripts or more anomalous behavior, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of these events might be enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation. I'd say the confidence is around 0.65. The justification is that there are multiple registry modifications and PowerShell executing scripts, which could be signs of malicious activity, though not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe (unusual for a browser) and PowerShell executing scripts with potential path obfuscation (e.g., '..\\\\') raise suspicion. File creation in user directories and process access events also warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and no file information. Chrome modifying the registry could be normal, like updating settings, but if it's doing this repeatedly, maybe there's something off. However, the same process doing the same action multiple times might just be part of normal operations, especially if it's a browser.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of its setup. That seems legitimate, but maybe the path is unusual or the file isn't expected. However, the justification here is not strong enough on its own.\n\nAnother event is from powershell.exe creating a file called \"elemento_base.txt\". PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily suspicious. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing malicious scripts, it could be a red flag. But with just this single event, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, the majority of events are from chrome.exe modifying the registry. If this is a normal user's machine, maybe it's just regular activity. However, if there's a sudden increase in such events, it might indicate something like a registry-based malware. But without more context, like unusual registry keys being modified or other processes involved, it's hard to say.\n\nThe other two events (winlogbeat and powershell) don't seem immediately suspicious. The confidence here is low because there's no clear indicator of compromise. The same process repeating the same action multiple times isn't enough on its own. Unless there's more context, like the registry changes being to specific keys or the files being created in unusual locations, but in this case, the files are in Downloads, which is a common place for user downloads.\n\nSo, overall, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The events are either normal or lack enough context to be concerning. Therefore, the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repetitive registry modification events from chrome.exe (common for browsers) and benign file creation events from winlogbeat.exe (log shipper) and powershell.exe (common tool). No clear indicators of malicious activity or anomalous patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
