First, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not suspicious here. But then I see powershell.exe coming into play. \n\nLooking at the powershell.exe events, there's a command line that includes a series of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used for enumerating user accounts, groups, and other system information. That's a red flag because it suggests the attacker is trying to gather information about the system's users and permissions, which is a common step in privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. While loading .NET DLLs might be normal for PowerShell scripts, the presence of MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender's component) could be interesting. However, it's not necessarily malicious on its own. \n\nAnother point is the File Create and File Delete events. A temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. This could be part of a script execution, which is common in both legitimate and malicious activities. However, when combined with the command-line enumeration, it might indicate that the script is performing some actions and then cleaning up.\n\nThe repetition of the same command line in multiple Provider Lifecycle events might indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's some logging happening, but it's not clear if that's malicious. \n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell executing commands that gather system information, along with the creation and deletion of a temporary file, suggests potential reconnaissance activities. While some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, the pattern here is more indicative of a malicious actor trying to map out the system. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of exploitation or data exfiltration, but the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **PowerShell Enumeration Commands**:\n   - The `powershell.exe` process executes a command line containing multiple system reconnaissance commands (e.g., `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `ls C:\\Users`, `get-childitem`, `dir`, `net localgroup`). These commands are commonly used to **enumerate user accounts, groups, and file systems**, which is a hallmark of **initial reconnaissance** during an attack.\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory and then immediately deleted. This pattern is often seen in **malicious scripts** that execute and then clean up traces, though it can also occur in legitimate scenarios (e.g., automated tools).\n\n3. **Repetition of \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - The same command line is logged repeatedly in \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, which may indicate **logging or monitoring activity**. While not inherently malicious, this could signal an attempt to **persist or evade detection**.\n\n4. **DLL Loading**:\n   - PowerShell loads several DLLs (e.g., `.NET` and `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender). While some are legitimate, the combination with the above activities raises questions about **potential tooling or exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### Contextual Analysis:\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**: PowerShell is a common administrative tool, and some commands (e.g., `net user`) are used in routine troubleshooting. However, **the combination of enumeration, file creation\/deletion, and repeated logging** is less typical of benign activity.\n- **Malicious Indicators**: The behavior aligns with **post-exploitation reconnaissance** (e.g., mapping users\/groups for lateral movement or privilege escalation). The temporary file suggests **script-based execution**, which is often used in attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\n- **Investigate Further**: Check for additional logs (e.g., process tree, network traffic, registry changes) to confirm if this is part of a larger attack chain.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage**: Restrict or log PowerShell execution if itâ€™s not required, and use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **EDR solutions** to detect anomalous behavior.\n- **Check for Lateral Movement**: Look for subsequent activities (e.g., SMB connections, credential dumping) that may follow this reconnaissance phase.\n\n---\n\n### Confidence Level:\n**Highly Suspicious (75-85% confidence)**. While not definitive proof of a breach, the combination of system enumeration, file cleanup, and repeated logging strongly suggests **malicious activity** requiring deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a Pipe Created event. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but creating pipes can sometimes be part of malicious activities. Not sure yet, need to check more.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, without more context, maybe it's just a setup.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe command line that includes several commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. That's a lot of commands that gather user and group information, which could be part of reconnaissance. That seems suspicious. Maybe an attacker is trying to find users and groups to escalate privileges or move laterally.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. However, the path is in the Defender directory, which is expected.\n\nThere's a net.exe and net1.exe process creating. Net1.exe isn't a standard Windows process. The presence of net1.exe might be a typo or a malicious executable. That's a possible red flag.\n\nA file named pacote_ativo.txt is created by powershell.exe. The name is in Portuguese, which might be a clue, but not sure. Could be benign or malicious.\n\nChrome.exe has multiple registry value set events. Chrome updating registry settings is normal, but if there are many, it might be part of an attack. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event loads urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer. That's normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nSDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard process. Could be a red flag if it's not expected. But without knowing the environment, it's hard to say.\n\nUpdater.exe creating a pipe. The command line for updater.exe seems related to Google's crash reporting. That might be legitimate, but the presence of multiple processes and the command line parameters could be normal for an updater.\n\ncmdkey.exe \/list is run, which lists stored credentials. That's a sensitive action. If done by a legitimate process, it might be part of a script, but if not, it could be an attacker trying to steal credentials.\n\nThe events with \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" might be part of normal administrative tasks, but if they're coming from unexpected sources, that's suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the most concerning parts are the powershell.exe commands gathering user and group info, the presence of net1.exe (non-standard), the cmdkey.exe listing credentials, and the creation of a file in the Downloads folder. These could indicate reconnaissance or credential harvesting. However, some events might be legitimate depending on the environment. But given the combination, there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. So, the answer is yes, this batch is interesting and should be looked into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a script with commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, and `ls C:\\Users`. These actions **gather system user\/group information and stored credentials**, which are **common in initial reconnaissance phases** of attacks (e.g., identifying targets for privilege escalation or lateral movement).\n\n2. **Unusual Processes**:\n   - **`net1.exe`**: This is **not a standard Windows process**. Its presence (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1.exe`) could indicate a **malicious binary** or a typo (e.g., `net.exe` misconfigured).\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`**: While not inherently malicious, its execution of `combase.dll` (a core Windows COM library) may be **suspicious if unrelated to known legitimate software**.\n\n3. **Credential Exposure**:\n   - **`cmdkey.exe \/list`** was executed, which **lists stored credentials** in the Windows Credential Manager. If done by an attacker, this could be **part of credential harvesting**.\n\n4. **File Creation in Downloads Folder**:\n   - A file named **`pacote_ativo.txt`** (Portuguese for \"active package\") was created by `powershell.exe`. While benign in isolation, the **unusual filename and lack of context** raise questions about its purpose.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - The creation of a **Winlogbeat configuration file** in the Downloads directory might be **unexpected** if the system is not intentionally being configured for log shipping.\n\n### Contextual Considerations:\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**: Some activities (e.g., `cmdkey.exe`, `net.exe`, Winlogbeat) are **normal in certain environments** (e.g., system administration, log monitoring).\n- **False Positives**: The presence of `net1.exe` could be a misconfigured or renamed legitimate tool, but **absence of additional context** (e.g., process tree, parent process) makes it hard to confirm.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Yes, this batch is interesting and requires further investigation**. The combination of **PowerShell reconnaissance, unusual processes, credential-related commands, and ambiguous file creation** suggests **potential malicious activity**. A deeper dive into process lineage, network traffic, and file content analysis would be necessary to confirm or rule out compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the entries are about 'Security Group Management' under winlog, but those don't have any process or file details. Maybe that's normal, but I need to check the rest. Then there's a few entries with actual processes. \n\nLooking at the processes, there's 'SDXHelper.exe' loading 'combase.dll' and 'urlmon.dll'. Wait, those are system DLLs. If a process is loading them, is that normal? Maybe, but sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. However, the paths here are standard System32 locations, which are typical for Windows. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' running 'localgroup' commands. 'net localgroup' is used to manage user groups, which could be part of normal administrative tasks. But why is there a 'net1.exe'? That might be a typo or a renamed executable. If it's a legitimate process, maybe it's a mistake. But if it's a malicious one, that could be a red flag.\n\nPowerShell.exe is involved in several events: creating files, accessing processes, and setting registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The files created include 'modulo_base.txt' and a .yml.new file for winlogbeat. The .yml.new might be part of a configuration change, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, creating files in user directories isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other actions, it might be suspicious.\n\nThere's also 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, but if it's creating configuration files, maybe that's part of its setup. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could indicate someone trying to configure or install something.\n\nThe 'MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe' process is running with an installsource scheduler. That might be part of a scheduled update, which is normal. But again, the presence of multiple processes and file creations might be part of a larger activity.\n\nLooking for anomalies: The repeated 'Security Group Management' events might be noise, but the other events involve processes that are either legitimate or could be abused. The 'net1.exe' could be a typo or a malicious binary. The PowerShell activities are common in attacks, especially if they're creating files or modifying registry keys. However, without seeing actual malicious payloads or unexpected commands, it's hard to confirm.\n\nConfidence-wise, there are some suspicious elements, but they might be part of normal operations. The presence of 'net1.exe' and multiple PowerShell actions could indicate something, but not definitive. So maybe a moderate confidence level, around 0.6. It's interesting enough to warrant further investigation but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances performing file creation and registry modifications, combined with non-standard process names (e.g., 'net1.exe') and repeated image loads of system DLLs (urlmon.dll, combase.dll) suggest potential malicious activity or system tampering. The presence of winlogbeat file creation in user directories also raises questions about log collection configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
