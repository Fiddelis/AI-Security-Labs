Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process created. That's a normal Windows utility, so probably benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. The command lines involve using Compress-Archive with paths that look like they're from various directories, maybe part of a build or packaging process. The paths have a lot of backslashes and seem to be compressing different folders into temporary zip files. \n\nLooking at the tasks, most are 'Process Create' or 'Image loaded', which are typical. However, there's a 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events for temporary PowerShell scripts. The fact that a script is created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. Usually, if a script is created and then deleted, it could be part of an attempt to hide malicious activity. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Pipeline Execution Details' with the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module. That module is used for compressing files, so maybe the user is just doing legitimate backups or packaging. However, the repetition of similar commands across different paths might indicate automated or scripted behavior, which could be benign or malicious.\n\nAnother point is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating a configuration file, that's normal. But the presence of multiple PowerShell events with temporary files might be a red flag. \n\nThe 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' events are standard, but 'calc.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll' is normal too. \n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the repeated use of PowerShell to compress files from various directories into temporary zips, creating and deleting scripts, and the high number of similar events. This could be part of a legitimate process, but the pattern might also be indicative of malicious activity, like exfiltrating data or preparing for an attack. However, without more context like network activity or unexpected binaries, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think this warrants further investigation. The logs show activity that's not obviously malicious but has enough unusual patterns to be considered interesting for a cybersecurity investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and patterns that could warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Usage:**\n   - **Frequent Use of `Compress-Archive`:** Multiple PowerShell processes execute `Compress-Archive` commands to compress directories (e.g., `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`) into temporary ZIP files in the `Temp` directory. While this could be part of a legitimate build or packaging process, the repetitive nature and lack of clear purpose (e.g., no mention of backup or deployment) raises suspicion.\n   - **Script Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted. This behavior is often seen in malicious scripts designed to execute payloads and then erase traces.\n\n2. **File and Module Activity:**\n   - **Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive Module:** Repeated references to this module (used for compression) are normal, but the lack of context (e.g., no user interaction or clear purpose) could indicate automated or unmonitored processes.\n   - **Winlogbeat File Creation:** The `winlogbeat.exe` process creates a `.yml.new` file, which is typical for configuration updates but should be verified for unauthorized changes.\n\n3. **Benign Processes:**\n   - **`whoami.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`:** These are standard utilities and do not indicate malicious activity. The `urlmon.dll` load in `calc.exe` is also normal (related to URL handling).\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Unusual Script Behavior:** The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n- **Repetitive Compression:** The repeated use of `Compress-Archive` across arbitrary directories might suggest data exfiltration, preparation for lateral movement, or automated tasks without clear justification.\n- **Lack of Context:** No logs mention user interaction, network activity, or other system changes (e.g., registry modifications beyond the `notepad.exe` event), making it harder to determine intent.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Network Logs:** Check if the compressed files are being transferred to external IPs or domains.\n2. **Inspect Script Content:** Analyze the deleted script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) if possible (e.g., via file system metadata or memory dumps).\n3. **Monitor User Activity:** Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) has elevated privileges or access to sensitive data.\n4. **Verify Winlogbeat Configuration:** Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration update and not tampered with.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **normal system behavior** but include **potentially suspicious patterns** (script creation\/deletion, repetitive compression). While not definitively malicious, these activities merit further investigation to rule out adversarial activity. **This is a low-priority alert but should be reviewed in the context of broader system monitoring.**"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll from System32. That seems normal because urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows system file. But wait, maybe there's something else here. The other events are all about chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. Setting registry values isn't inherently bad, but doing it repeatedly could be a sign of something like a configuration change or maybe even a malicious attempt to modify settings. However, chrome.exe is a common process, so maybe it's just normal operation. There's also an event where chrome.exe loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory. That's a legitimate file too, part of Microsoft Defender. Then there's a ProcessAccess event for powershell.exe, which could be normal or suspicious depending on context.\n\nHmm, but looking at all the events together, are there any patterns? The repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might be worth looking into. But since they're all the same task and file is None, maybe it's just part of Chrome's normal functioning. The Calculator and chrome loading legitimate DLLs don't seem suspicious. The powershell event is a ProcessAccess, which could be benign, like a script running. However, without more context, like unusual parameters or unexpected parent processes, it's hard to tell. Since all the events involve legitimate processes and files, and no obvious malicious activity like unexpected network connections or unauthorized access, maybe this isn't interesting. But the repeated registry changes might be a red flag. However, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be moderate. Let me check again. The justification needs to be concise. If there's no clear malicious activity, then it's not interesting. But if the repeated registry events are considered suspicious, then maybe it is. But without more info, I think it's safer to say not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe) interacting with known system files or performing standard operations (registry updates, image loading). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
