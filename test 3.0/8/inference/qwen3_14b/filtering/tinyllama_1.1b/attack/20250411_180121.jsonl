{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe with several ImageLoad events. The files loaded are all standard Windows DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so that's expected when running PowerShell scripts.\n\nWait, but then there's a FileCreate event where PowerShell creates a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1. Then immediately after, that file is deleted. That's a bit odd. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces. But maybe it's part of a legitimate process, like a temporary file during a script execution.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell using WebClient to download files from GitHub. The URLs are all pointing to LICENSE.txt files from various repositories. While downloading a license file isn't inherently malicious, the fact that it's happening multiple times and from different repositories might be suspicious. However, GitHub is a common source for open-source code, so it's possible these are legitimate downloads.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of the MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so no issue there. Also, there's a PipeEvent and some RegistryEvent entries, but nothing that stands out as malicious.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: multiple PowerShell processes downloading files, creating and deleting temporary scripts. While individual events might be normal, the combination could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or download payloads. However, without more context, like the content of the downloaded files or unusual behavior post-download, it's hard to be certain. The fact that the files are LICENSE.txt might be a red flag if they're being used as a cover for actual malicious payloads, but that's speculative.\n\nOn the other hand, many of these events are standard for PowerShell usage, especially in environments where scripts are frequently run. The temporary file creation and deletion is common in script execution. The multiple downloads from GitHub could be part of a legitimate process, like fetching resources for a tool or application.\n\nSo, the classification here is a bit tricky. There's some suspicious activity, but not enough conclusive evidence to categorize it as definitely malicious. It might be worth investigating further to check the content of the downloaded files and the context in which they're being used. However, based solely on the events provided, the confidence isn't extremely high. Therefore, the batch might be considered interesting but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Interesting for further investigation\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events involving temporary script file creation\/deletion, repeated GitHub LICENSE.txt downloads via WebClient, and registry\/pipe activity. While individual events are common, the combination of temporary file handling and repeated external downloads raises potential concerns about script-based operations or payload delivery. However, no direct malicious indicators (e.g., suspicious file hashes, anomalous network destinations) are present in the provided logs.\",\n  \"confidence\": \"Medium\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to look through all the events. Let me scan through them. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up Winlogbeat, but maybe not suspicious. Then there's notepad.exe and svchost.exe doing registry stuff. Hmm, svchost.exe is a common system process, so registry changes there might be normal, but multiple entries could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows, so that's probably okay. The whoami.exe commands are just checking the user, which is normal. The cmd.exe command is deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" – that might be suspicious because deleting a task could be an attempt to remove something malicious. But then there's schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate system file.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there are multiple instances of Process accessed and Registry value set. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a point of concern. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be part of a script's normal operation, but if it's done in a suspicious way, it could be malicious.\n\nAnother thing is the command_line entries with \"powershell.exe & {}\" – that looks like a placeholder or test command, maybe not harmful. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell activities, especially with registry changes and file operations, might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or execute scripts without proper authorization.\n\nI should also check for any unusual file paths. The first event has a file in the Downloads directory, which is common. The deleted file is in Temp, which is typical for temporary files. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, scheduled task deletion, and PowerShell usage might be indicative of an attack. But I need to be careful not to overreact to normal system activities.\n\nConfidence-wise, there are some suspicious elements but not definitive proof. The presence of multiple PowerShell events, registry modifications, and a scheduled task deletion could be part of a malicious activity, but they could also be part of legitimate troubleshooting or configuration changes. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the combination of these events might be enough to warrant further investigation, so I'd lean towards INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities, registry modifications, and a scheduled task deletion (\\\"spawn\\\") are observed, which could indicate attempts to execute scripts, modify system configurations, or remove traces of malicious activity.

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. That's common, but I should check for any suspicious patterns. There are entries about 'Pipe Created', 'Image loaded', 'File created', and 'Registry value set'. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the 'File created' event where a .yml.new file is created in the Downloads directory. That might be part of a normal installation, but I should check if it's related to any malicious activity. However, there's also a 'File created' event in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory with a .ps1 file. PowerShell scripts in Temp folders can be a red flag, especially if they're executed without user interaction.\n\nAnother point is the repeated 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events for powershell.exe. These could indicate that the process is modifying system settings or accessing other processes, which might be part of a larger attack. The 'Image loaded' events point to system DLLs like MpClient.dll and clr.dll, which are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be problematic.\n\nThere's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that might be normal. However, the presence of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events for powershell.exe might indicate something's wrong, like a PowerShell module being loaded that shouldn't be.\n\nI should also check for any command-line arguments. Some entries have 'powershell.exe & {}', which is a placeholder. That might be a red herring, but if there are actual commands being executed, that's more concerning. However, in the given data, the command lines are either empty or use placeholders.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple file creations in temporary directories, frequent process and registry access, and the use of PowerShell, which is often abused by attackers, suggests that this might be interesting. However, without more context or specific malicious commands, it's not definitive. The confidence level is moderate, around 0.7, because while there are suspicious activities, they could also be part of normal operations. I'll need to flag this for further investigation but not jump to conclusions.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including file creation in temporary directories, registry modifications, and process access events.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them involve PowerShell.exe. There are several instances where PowerShell is used to remove files from the TEMP directory, like objeto_principal.zip, tarefa_base.zip, estrutura_comum.zip, etc. The command lines use Remove-Item with ErrorAction Ignore, which might be a way to avoid errors if the file doesn't exist. But why so many different files being deleted? That seems a bit suspicious. Usually, deleting multiple files might be part of cleaning up after some activity, maybe malicious.\n\nThen there are events about image loaded, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll. These are .NET Framework components. Loading these might be normal, but combined with PowerShell activity, it could indicate something. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. That temporary file being created and deleted quickly might be part of executing a script without leaving traces.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication. Not sure if that's malicious, but combined with other events, it's worth noting. The events also include Registry value set and Process accessed, which might be part of changing settings or interacting with other processes.\n\nNow, considering the frequency of PowerShell commands removing files from TEMP, along with the loading of .NET DLLs and the temporary script file, this could be a sign of a malicious actor trying to execute scripts, clean up logs, or avoid detection. The repetition of similar commands with different file names might be an attempt to remove evidence or multiple payloads.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign explanation. For example, automated cleanup scripts or legitimate software updates. But the combination of multiple file deletions, temporary script creation, and loading of .NET components without obvious legitimate context makes me lean towards it being suspicious. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be a red herring, but the overall pattern still seems concerning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has multiple PowerShell activities that are indicative of potential malicious behavior, such as cleaning up files and possibly executing scripts. The confidence is high, but not 100%, because there's a chance it could be a false positive. But given the patterns, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **multiple suspicious patterns** indicative of potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **Frequent PowerShell File Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n   - Repeated use of `Remove-Item` commands targeting files like `objeto_principal.zip`, `tarefa_base.zip`, and `estrutura_comum.zip` in the `$env:TEMP` directory. This suggests **cleanup of temporary files**, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\n2. **Temporary Script File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1` is created and deleted rapidly. This pattern is often used to **execute scripts without leaving persistent evidence**.\n\n3. **Loading of .NET Framework Components**:\n   - Multiple events show loading of `.dll` files like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `clrjit.dll`, which are core to .NET execution. While legitimate, this could indicate **scripting or payload execution** via PowerShell.\n\n4. **Unusual Process and Registry Activity**:\n   - Events involving `ProcessAccess`, `Registry value set`, and `Pipe Created` suggest **inter-process communication or configuration changes**, which may be part of a larger attack chain.\n\n5. **Repetition of Similar Commands**:\n   - The same `Remove-Item` commands are repeated with different filenames (e.g., `.txt`, `.zip`), indicating **systematic cleanup** or evasion tactics.\n\n### Contextual Considerations:\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**: Some cleanup or scripting activities could be benign (e.g., automated tools). However, the **lack of clear context** (e.g., no associated application logs, user interaction, or known good processes) raises concerns.\n- **Windows Defender DLLs**: The presence of Defender-related DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) might be a red herring, but the overall pattern still suggests **evasive behavior**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events are **highly suspicious** and align with **malware behavior patterns** (cleanup, script execution, evasion). While further analysis (e.g., correlating with network traffic, user context, or file hashes) is needed to confirm malicious intent, this batch **warrants immediate investigation**.\n\n**Classification**: **High Priority – Potential Malicious Activity**  \n**Confidence Level**: **High (85-95%)**  \n**Recommended Action**: Investigate PowerShell scripts, analyze deleted files (if recoverable), and monitor for lateral movement or persistence mechanisms."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes it can be a red flag if there's unusual behavior. Let me check the tasks. There are several ImageLoad events pointing to .NET framework DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's an ImageLoad event for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That could be okay, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are FileCreate events. One of them is a temporary file in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The file name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1. That seems like a PowerShell script. Creating temporary scripts could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use temporary files to execute malicious code. However, just creating a script isn't necessarily bad unless there's execution or other suspicious activity around it.\n\nThere are also several Remove-Item commands in the command_line fields. These are trying to delete files in the TEMP directory, like registro_comum.txt, estrutura_padrao.txt, and pacote_ativo.txt. The user is using -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, which might indicate they want to ensure those files are removed without errors. But why would someone delete these files? Maybe they're cleaning up after some activity. However, if these files are part of a legitimate process, that's fine. But if they're trying to remove logs or evidence, that's suspicious.\n\nLooking at the other processes, there's chrome.exe with multiple Registry value set events. That might be normal if Chrome is updating its settings, but repeated registry changes could be a sign of something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe majority of the events are related to powershell.exe, which is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system DLLs might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it could indicate something more. However, the justification for being interesting would need to be based on a pattern that suggests malicious intent.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. The combination of creating a temporary PowerShell script and then trying to delete files in the TEMP directory might be part of a cleanup process. But if the script is being created and then immediately deleted, that could be a sign of an attack. However, in the logs provided, the FileCreate is for the script, and then the Remove-Item commands are for other files. Maybe the script is part of a process that's being cleaned up. Alternatively, the deletion of those specific files might be unrelated.\n\nAnother point: the repeated ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. If a process is being accessed multiple times, that could be normal, but if it's being accessed by other processes in a way that's not typical, that might be a concern. However, the logs don't specify which processes are accessing it.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is a standard utility to check user context, which is normal. But if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show normal PowerShell usage with some file operations. The creation of a temporary script and deletion of other temp files might be part of a legitimate process, like a script that's being tested or cleaned up. However, without more context or other indicators of compromise (like network activity, unexpected commands, or unusual registry changes), it's hard to say for sure. The activity isn't clearly malicious, but it's also not entirely benign. Therefore, it might warrant further investigation to determine if there's any hidden malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple **`ProcessAccess`** and **`Registry value set`** events for **`powershell.exe`** are common but could indicate legitimate administrative tasks or potential misuse (e.g., script execution, privilege escalation).\n   - A **temporary PowerShell script** (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory. While this could be part of a legitimate test, **temporary script creation** is a common tactic in malicious operations (e.g., payload delivery).\n\n2. **File Deletion Attempts:**\n   - **`Remove-Item`** commands in **`powershell.exe`**'s command line attempt to delete files (`registro_comum.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`, `pacote_ativo.txt`) in the `Temp` directory. The use of **`-Force`** and **`-ErrorAction Ignore`** suggests an intent to **suppress errors** and ensure deletion, which may indicate cleanup of evidence or logs.\n\n3. **Windows Defender DLL Load:**\n   - An **`ImageLoad`** event for **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender component) is logged. While this is normal, it could be a red herring if malicious actors are masquerading as legitimate processes.\n\n4. **Chrome.exe Activity:**\n   - Repeated **`Registry value set`** events for **`chrome.exe`** are likely benign (e.g., browser settings updates), but could also hint at tampering if paired with other anomalies.\n\n5. **Whoami.exe:**\n   - A single **`ProcessCreate`** event for **`whoami.exe`** is normal (used to check user context), but its presence alongside PowerShell activity might indicate reconnaissance.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The activity is not definitively malicious but includes **suspicious patterns** (e.g., temporary script creation, aggressive file deletion) that could signal **cleanup after a malicious action** or **testing of scripts**.\n- **No Clear IOC (Indicators of Compromise):** No direct evidence of malware, lateral movement, or exfiltration is present in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for **network traffic**, **file modifications**, or **unexpected process interactions** around the time of these events.\n- **Monitor Temp Directory:** Investigate the deleted files (`registro_comum.txt`, etc.) and the script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`) for content or metadata.\n- **Review PowerShell Scripts:** If the script is recoverable, analyze its contents for malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n- **Check User Context:** Verify if the **`whoami.exe`** command was executed by a privileged user or in a context that could enable escalation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **not clearly malicious**, but the combination of **PowerShell script creation**, **aggressive file deletion**, and **repeated registry changes** raises enough suspicion to warrant **closer scrutiny**. Further investigation into the script content, user context, and system behavior is recommended. \n\n**Verdict:** 🔍 **Interesting for further investigation** (not conclusive evidence of compromise)."}
