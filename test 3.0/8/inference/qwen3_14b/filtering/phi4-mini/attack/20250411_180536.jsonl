{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the chrome.exe processes. There are several entries about DNS queries and network connections. Chrome doing DNS lookups and connecting to the network isn't unusual on its own, but the repetition might be a red flag. However, without knowing the destinations, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThen there's the powershell.exe activity. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. There are multiple ProcessAccess events and a RegistryEvent. The RegistryEvent could indicate changes to system settings, which might be part of persistence mechanisms. But again, without more context, it's hard to be sure.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes sc.exe create and start commands. The sc.exe is used to manage Windows services. Creating a new service with a custom executable path (like \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\") is suspicious. This could be an attempt to install a backdoor or a malicious service. The command line also uses \"sc.exe start modulo_comum\" which might be trying to start that service immediately.\n\nAnother sc.exe entry creates a service named \"tarefa_principal\" pointing to another executable. This is another red flag. Legitimate software usually doesn't create services with such obscure names and paths. Also, the use of \"start=auto\" suggests the service is set to run automatically, which is common for malware to maintain persistence.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are from Windows' .NET framework. These are legitimate, but if they're being loaded by unexpected processes, that could be an issue. However, in the logs here, they're associated with pacote_padrao.exe and tarefa_base.exe, which might be part of some application. Not sure yet, but need to check if those processes are known.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But the file name has a .new extension, which might be part of the normal operation. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of tampering.\n\nOther entries involve services.exe and conhost.exe with Registry value sets. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, but frequent registry changes could indicate tampering. Conhost.exe is related to console windows, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious parts are the sc.exe commands creating services with unusual names and paths, the multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, and the registry changes. These could indicate an attempt to install persistent backdoors. However, some of these might be part of legitimate software installations or system changes. But given the number of suspicious events and the use of service creation, this seems like a potential security incident worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Service Creation via `sc.exe`**\n- **Command Example**:  \n  `sc.exe create \"modulo_geral\" binPath= \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\" start= auto`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  - **Persistence Mechanism**: Creating a Windows service with a custom executable path (e.g., `unidade_base.exe`) and setting it to start automatically (`start=auto`) is a common tactic for malware to ensure persistence.  \n  - **Obscure File Paths**: The use of non-standard directories (e.g., `modulo_geral`) and executable names may indicate obfuscation or evasion techniques.\n\n- **Another Service**:  \n  `sc.exe create \"tarefa_principal\" binPath= \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\...\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\"`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  - The service name (`tarefa_principal`) and path suggest a possible attempt to disguise malicious activity as legitimate software.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell and `cmd.exe` Activity**\n- **PowerShell Events**:  \n  - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events and **`ProcessAccess`** logs.  \n  - **Risk**: PowerShell is often abused by attackers for executing payloads or modifying system settings.  \n  - **Lack of Context**: Without additional details (e.g., script content or registry keys modified), this could indicate reconnaissance or configuration changes.\n\n- **`cmd.exe` Command**:  \n  - **Command Example**:  \n    `sc.exe create ... && sc.exe start modulo_comum`  \n  - **Risk**: Directly invoking `sc.exe` to create and start a service in a single command is suspicious and could indicate manual or automated exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Suspicious File Creation**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation**:  \n  - **File Path**:  \n    `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`  \n  - **Risk**:  \n    - While `winlogbeat` is a legitimate log shipper, the creation of a `.new` configuration file in the `Downloads` directory could indicate tampering or unauthorized configuration changes.  \n    - **Repetition**: The same file is logged twice, which might suggest an attempt to overwrite or modify the configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Registry Modifications**\n- **Frequent `Registry value set` Events**:  \n  - Involving processes like `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and others.  \n  - **Risk**:  \n    - Registry changes can be used to modify system behavior (e.g., adding new services, altering startup entries, or disabling security features).  \n    - **Lack of Context**: Without knowing the specific keys or values modified, this remains a potential red flag.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Image Load Events**\n- **`mscoree.dll` and `mscoreei.dll`**:  \n  - These are legitimate components of the .NET framework.  \n  - **Risk**:  \n    - If loaded by unexpected processes (e.g., `pacote_padrao.exe`, `tarefa_base.exe`), this could indicate a compromised application or exploit.  \n    - **Need for Correlation**: Check if these processes are associated with known legitimate software or if their behavior deviates from expected norms.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch exhibits **multiple indicators of compromise (IoCs)** that are commonly associated with **malware persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration**. Key concerns include:\n\n- **Service creation** with non-standard paths and names.  \n- **PowerShell\/cmd.exe activity** coupled with **registry modifications**.  \n- **Unusual file creation** by `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper, not typically involved in service creation).  \n\n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Correlate with Host-Based Logs**: Check for additional logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs, process tree analysis) to confirm the legitimacy of these activities.  \n2. **Analyze File Hashes**: Verify the integrity of files like `unidade_base.exe` and `tarefa_principal` using threat intelligence platforms.  \n3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Investigate DNS queries and network connections from `chrome.exe` to identify potential C2 (command-and-control) communication.  \n4. **Review User Activity**: Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) has administrative privileges or if the activity aligns with their normal behavior.  \n\n**Verdict**: **High Risk** â€“ This activity is consistent with a potential security incident and requires immediate investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting. So, first, looking at the JSONL data provided. Each line is a separate event.\n\nFirst event: notepad.exe with a registry value set. Notepad is a common application, so maybe normal. But registry changes can be suspicious if they're not expected. But alone, maybe not a big deal.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but if it's accessing a process, maybe that's part of normal operations. But sometimes PowerShell is used in attacks. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThird event: calc.exe loading a DLL from C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, so that might be normal. But why is calc.exe loading it? Maybe that's part of normal operations. But if it's a different path or a suspicious one, that would be a red flag. Here, the path seems legitimate.\n\nFourth and fifth events: svchost.exe with registry value set. Svchost is a standard Windows process that hosts multiple services. Registry changes here might be normal, but if there are multiple instances or unexpected changes, that could be suspicious. However, the events don't indicate any specific malicious activity.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's no clear pattern of malicious activity. The processes involved are all legitimate, and the actions (registry changes, process access, image loading) are things that can happen normally. However, the presence of PowerShell and svchost.exe might be worth noting, but without more context or unusual parameters, it's hard to classify them as malicious. \n\nBut the justification needs to be concise. Since none of the events show clear signs of malicious behavior, like unexpected file paths, unusual command-line arguments, or known malicious activities, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while there's no obvious threat, some processes are commonly used in attacks. But without more indicators, it's not enough to flag as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe) performing normal operations (registry changes, process access, image loading). No suspicious file paths, unexpected behavior, or known malicious indicators are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
