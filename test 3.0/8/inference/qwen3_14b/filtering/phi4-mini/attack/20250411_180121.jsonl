{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not a red flag yet. But then I see several entries involving powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's doing things like downloading files from GitHub, that might be worth looking into.\n\nLooking closer, there's a process where powershell.exe uses WebClient to download a LICENSE.txt file from a GitHub raw URL. The command line shows that the file is being saved to the user's TEMP directory. That's a common technique used by malware to download payloads. Also, there are multiple instances of similar commands, each downloading different files from various GitHub repositories. The paths and filenames don't look like standard system files, which is suspicious.\n\nThen, there are events about image loading, like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are .NET framework components, so maybe the PowerShell script is using .NET to perform actions. However, the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that something is trying to inject code or load additional modules.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory. The file is created and then immediately deleted, which could be a sign of temporary files used during an attack. Also, the use of $env:TEMP suggests that the attacker is trying to keep their traces minimal.\n\nThe Registry value set events for powershell.exe might indicate changes to the registry, possibly to persist the malicious activity or modify system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're benign or malicious.\n\nThe Chrome.exe events are mostly DNS and network activity, which is normal, but if they're part of a larger pattern, like beaconing to a C2 server, that would be concerning. However, the logs don't show repeated connections to the same IP or suspicious domains, just generic GitHub URLs. GitHub is a legitimate source, but downloading LICENSE files from there might be a way to exfiltrate data or download malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities, especially the multiple downloads from GitHub, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the image loads might indicate a potential security incident. The fact that these are all happening in a short time frame could be a sign of an attack. However, since the files are from GitHub and the names are generic, it's possible that this is a false positive or a legitimate script. But given the number of PowerShell events and the use of DownloadFile, it's more likely to be suspicious. Therefore, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75 to 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **PowerShell Download Activity:**\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes are observed using `WebClient.DownloadFile` to retrieve `LICENSE.txt` files from **GitHub raw URLs** (e.g., `https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...`). \n   - While GitHub is a legitimate source, the repetitive use of this technique to download files into the **TEMP directory** (`$env:TEMP`) raises concerns. This pattern is commonly used by malware to exfiltrate data or execute payloads.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in TEMP:**\n   - Files like `registro_comum.txt`, `estrutura_logico.txt`, and `elemento_padrao.txt` are created in the `Downloads` and `TEMP` directories and later deleted. This behavior is often associated with **temporary storage** during malicious operations or **clean-up after execution**.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Loading of .NET framework components (`mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) suggests the use of **.NET-based payloads** or scripting. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate **code injection** or execution of untrusted scripts.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` may indicate **registry persistence mechanisms** or configuration changes, though further context is needed to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- The **repetitive use of PowerShell for downloading files** from GitHub, combined with **temporary file creation\/deletion**, aligns with **malware behavior patterns** (e.g., data exfiltration, payload delivery).\n- The **lack of clear benign context** (e.g., no logs indicating legitimate script execution) makes this activity **highly suspicious**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, process tree) to confirm if the downloaded files are benign or malicious.\n- **Analyze the contents** of the downloaded `LICENSE.txt` files to check for obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Check for persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks) linked to the PowerShell activity.\n- **Monitor the TEMP\/Downloads directories** for unusual file activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Classification:**\n**INTERESTING** (High suspicion of potential malicious activity).  \n**Confidence Level:** 0.8 (Likely benign but requires further investigation).  \n\nThis activity should be prioritized for deeper analysis due to the suspicious patterns observed."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I'll go through each event and look for any suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple chrome.exe processes with Registry value set events. That alone might not be suspicious since Chrome can modify the registry for various reasons. But then there's an entry with powershell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender path. Wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender's files are usually in that directory. But I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. The URL is https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt. Downloading a LICENSE.txt file might be normal, but the command is using WebClient's DownloadFile method. However, the filename is tarefa_ativo.txt, which doesn't look like a standard license file. Maybe that's a red flag? Or perhaps it's just a normal download. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple File created events for PowerShell startup profiles and a .yml.new file related to winlogbeat. Creating a new configuration file might be part of a setup or update. But the same file is mentioned multiple times, which could indicate some ongoing activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother entry is MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. Then, several Registry value set events for various processes like svchost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and conhost.exe. These are standard system processes, so modifying the registry might be part of their normal operations, but repeated changes could be suspicious if they're not expected.\n\nLooking at the command line for cmd.exe: SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F. This command is deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task might be normal if it's a leftover from a previous installation, but if the task was malicious, deleting it could be an attempt to cover tracks. However, without knowing what the task was doing, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution, which is a standard command to check user context. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the PowerShell command downloading a file from GitHub. While downloading a LICENSE.txt might seem benign, the use of PowerShell for such an action, especially if it's not a typical use case, could be part of a larger attack. Also, the repeated file creation events and registry modifications might indicate some form of configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. However, many of these events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate software updates. The confidence here is moderate because there's some suspicious activity, but not enough to be certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **PowerShell Download Command**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a command to download a file from a GitHub repository (`https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt`) and saved it as `tarefa_ativo.txt`. \n   - **Why this is concerning**: While downloading a `LICENSE.txt` file might seem benign, the use of PowerShell for this task is unusual for standard operations. The filename (`tarefa_ativo.txt`) does not match typical license file naming conventions, which could indicate a misdirection or obfuscation tactic.\n\n2. **Repeated File Creation Events**:\n   - Multiple entries show file creation for a `winlogbeat` configuration file (`*.yml.new`). This might suggest an attempt to modify or replace a monitoring tool's configuration, potentially to evade detection.\n\n3. **Scheduled Task Deletion**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process executed `SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F`, attempting to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\". \n   - **Why this is concerning**: Deleting a task could be an attempt to remove malicious persistence mechanisms, though it could also be a legitimate cleanup action if the task was no longer needed.\n\n4. **Frequent Registry Modifications**:\n   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `conhost.exe` repeatedly modified registry values. While these are legitimate system processes, excessive or unexplained registry changes could indicate tampering or persistence setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Windows Defender DLL Load**: The `MpClient.dll` from the Windows Defender directory is legitimate.\n- **Whoami.exe Execution**: Running `whoami.exe` is a standard diagnostic command.\n- **Normal System Processes**: Entries for `chrome.exe`, `Calculator.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are typical for a running system.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n- **Risk Level**: **Moderate**. While there are no definitive signs of a security breach, the combination of unusual PowerShell activity, file creation events, and registry modifications warrants further investigation.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  1. **Analyze the downloaded file** (`tarefa_ativo.txt`) to verify its contents and origin.\n  2. **Investigate the deleted scheduled task** (\"spawn\") to determine its purpose and whether it was malicious.\n  3. **Monitor for additional suspicious activity** related to registry changes or file modifications.\n  4. **Check for unauthorized changes to winlogbeat configurations** if monitoring tools are in use.\n\nWithout additional context (e.g., network traffic, file contents, user behavior), the logs suggest potential reconnaissance or configuration changes but do not confirm a breach."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: schtasks.exe is deleting a task named \"spawn\". That's a bit odd because normally, schtasks.exe is used to schedule tasks, but deleting a task might be part of a malicious process trying to remove evidence. However, alone, it's not necessarily bad.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows file, so probably not an issue here.\n\nThen, there are several events involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe. The command line for one cmd.exe instance is deleting a registry value in HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. Deleting registry entries could be part of cleaning up after malware, but again, not conclusive yet.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution. That's a standard tool for checking user context, so unless it's being used in an unusual way, it's probably benign.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe events, there are multiple instances of process access and registry value changes. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. The presence of multiple registry modifications and process accesses could indicate someone is trying to manipulate system settings or execute scripts.\n\nAnother cmd.exe instance is using reg.exe to delete another registry value. This seems like part of a pattern to remove entries that might be used for persistence, such as those in the Run key. Attackers often modify the registry to ensure their malicious code runs at startup.\n\nThe image load events for PowerShell include loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in an unexpected context, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, PowerShell using .NET is normal, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, and using PowerShell and cmd.exe for these actions could indicate an attempt to remove traces of an attack or set up persistence. The repeated registry changes and process accesses suggest someone is trying to manipulate the system. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the number of events related to registry modifications and the use of tools like schtasks and PowerShell, this batch does seem suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence is moderate because while the actions aren't definitively malicious, the pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled task 'spawn' via schtasks.exe, repeated registry modifications (HKCU\\\\Run key deletions), and frequent PowerShell\/cmd.exe process creation\/access events.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender path: MpOAV.dll. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender is a known Microsoft product. But wait, the file path is in ProgramData, which is a common location for system files. However, sometimes malware can disguise itself as legitimate files. But just loading a legitimate DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a name that looks like a PowerShell script test. Then, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be normal, especially if it's part of a script execution. But the fact that it's in the Temp folder and the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" could be part of a legitimate process or maybe a test. However, the presence of such files and their deletion might be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there's a lot of them or in unusual contexts, it might be a red flag. However, with just one event, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances of \"powershell.exe & {}\" which is an empty command. That might be a sign of something trying to execute a script but failing, or maybe a placeholder. However, it's not necessarily malicious. Also, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, which might be related to logging or monitoring tools.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a file in the Downloads directory for winlogbeat, which is a log shipping tool. That seems legitimate, especially if the user is setting up monitoring. But the presence of that file might be part of a normal installation process.\n\nThere are also multiple registry value set events, but they don't specify which keys or values. Changing registry values can be part of both legitimate and malicious activities. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes are standard system utilities. Running whoami is common for checking user context, so that's probably normal.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of events: multiple PowerShell activities, including creating and deleting temporary files, loading DLLs, and registry changes. However, most of the files involved are in legitimate locations. The only suspicious thing might be the repeated empty PowerShell commands and the temporary file creation\/deletion. But those could be part of a script that's being tested or a benign process.\n\nWait, the first event's file path is MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. If that's a legitimate file, then that's okay. But if an attacker is somehow compromising that file, it could be a problem. However, without more evidence like unexpected network activity or unusual process behavior, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAnother point is the number of events related to PowerShell. While PowerShell is often used by attackers, it's also a standard tool for administrators. The presence of multiple events might not be suspicious in itself unless there's a pattern of abuse, like using PowerShell for downloading malicious payloads or executing commands that aren't typical.\n\nIn conclusion, there are some potentially suspicious activities like temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple PowerShell events, but they could also be part of normal system operations. Without additional context or more suspicious indicators (like network connections to bad IPs, unexpected processes, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. However, the fact that there's a mix of legitimate and possibly benign activities might not be enough to classify this as a high-priority alert. But the presence of multiple events that could be indicative of testing or probing might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Event Log:**\n\nThe event log contains a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Activities:**\n- **Windows Defender DLL Loading:**  \n  - Event: `powershell.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll` from `C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\mscoreei.dll` and `mscorlib.ni.dll`.  \n  - **Context:** These are standard .NET and Windows Defender components. Loading these DLLs is typical for legitimate processes, especially those involving .NET applications or security tools.  \n  - **Verdict:** Likely benign.\n\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation:**  \n  - Event: A file named `winlogbeat-...` is created in the `Downloads` directory.  \n  - **Context:** Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipping tool. This could indicate a user installing or configuring monitoring software.  \n  - **Verdict:** Likely benign.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Activities:**\n- **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**  \n  - Event: A PowerShell script (`PSScriptPolicyTest`) is created in the `Temp` directory and immediately deleted.  \n  - **Context:** While temporary files are common, the name `PSScriptPolicyTest` could hint at testing or probing. The deletion might be an attempt to avoid leaving traces, though this is not definitive.  \n  - **Verdict:** **Low-risk suspicion**—requires further context (e.g., source of the script, network activity).\n\n- **Empty PowerShell Commands:**  \n  - Events: Repeated instances of `powershell.exe & {}` (empty command).  \n  - **Context:** This could indicate failed attempts to execute malicious scripts, or placeholders in logging. However, it could also be part of normal tooling (e.g., testing).  \n  - **Verdict:** **Low-risk suspicion**—needs correlation with other logs (e.g., failed executions, network calls).\n\n- **Registry Modifications:**  \n  - Events: Multiple `Registry value set` entries without specific key details.  \n  - **Context:** Registry changes are common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios. Without knowing the keys\/changes, this is inconclusive.  \n  - **Verdict:** **Neutral**—requires deeper analysis of registry keys and values.\n\n- **Pipe Creation:**  \n  - Event: A `Pipe created` entry.  \n  - **Context:** Pipes are used for inter-process communication. While normal, this could be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., lateral movement).  \n  - **Verdict:** **Low-risk suspicion**—needs correlation with other processes or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Overall Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** **Low to Medium**  \n  - The log shows **no clear evidence of malware** (e.g., unusual network connections, unauthorized binaries, or privilege escalation).  \n  - However, the **combination of temporary file activity, empty PowerShell commands, and registry changes** could indicate **probing or testing** by an attacker or a legitimate user.  \n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  - **Correlate with network logs** to check for outbound connections to suspicious IPs or domains.  \n  - **Inspect the full command line** of PowerShell processes (e.g., `& {}` may be a red herring).  \n  - **Check the source of the temporary file** (e.g., via file integrity monitoring or process tree analysis).  \n  - **Review registry changes** for modifications to keys like `HKCU\\Software` or `HKLM\\Software` (common targets for persistence).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious** but warrant **further investigation** due to the presence of ambiguous indicators (temporary files, empty PowerShell commands). If this is part of a larger attack chain (e.g., with network exfiltration or persistence), the risk would escalate. For now, **monitor and investigate** but **no immediate action is required**."}

There are also some entries for chrome.exe and conhost.exe, but they seem less suspicious. \n\nLooking at the PowerShell activities, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack to hide malicious activity. The file path is in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for temporary files but could be abused.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple ImageLoad events pointing to .NET framework DLLs like clrjit.dll, MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll, mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are legitimate system files, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it might indicate something's wrong.

That might be a benign command, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be a way to execute nothing, maybe to bypass detection. Also, another entry has a command to remove a zip file from the Temp directory. The user might be trying to clean up after an attack, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Registry value set events are numerous, but since they're from both PowerShell and Chrome, it's possible that some are normal. However, if a process is modifying multiple registry keys, that could be suspicious. However, Chrome might be doing legitimate things here, so I need to consider that.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that PowerShell is being accessed by other processes, which could be normal or could indicate a compromise. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious parts are the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which could be part of an attack.

Let me check the tasks. There are several 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events. For example, files are being created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That's a common tactic used by malware to hide its presence. The filenames have random-looking names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1, which might be obfuscated scripts.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Remove-Item' commands in the command_line fields. These are deleting files in the TEMP directory. While deleting files isn't inherently malicious, doing so in a pattern and combined with other activities might indicate cleanup after an attack. Also, the repeated use of 'ErrorAction Ignore' suggests the attacker wants to avoid errors if the files aren't present, which is a sign of careful planning.\n\nThere's also a 'Pipe Created' event, which could be used for inter-process communication, possibly for malicious purposes.

However, the fact that PowerShell is loading these might be normal too, depending on context.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated creation and deletion of temporary files, along with multiple PowerShell commands that are cleaning up files, might indicate an attempt to execute scripts and then remove traces. This behavior is often seen in malware or malicious scripts. However, there's no direct evidence of exploitation or data exfiltration.

The winlog tasks are things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. The file events are mostly None, except for two entries where files are created: one related to winlogbeat and another called pacote_ativo.txt.\n\nNow, the key here is to see if there's any suspicious activity. The repetition of powershell.exe being accessed multiple times might be normal, but combined with other events, it could indicate something. The whoami.exe is being run, which is a standard command to get user info, but if it's done repeatedly, maybe that's part of a larger process.\n\nThe file creation events: winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its configuration.
