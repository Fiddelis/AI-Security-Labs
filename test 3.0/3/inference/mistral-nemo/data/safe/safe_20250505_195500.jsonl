These files are JavaScript files (.min.js).\n- The files are located under the path:\n  ```\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\n  ```\n\n**Timestamps:**\n- The logs don't provide timestamps, so we can't determine the exact sequence or duration of these file creations.\n\n**Possible Reason for File Creation:**\n- Since 'SDXHelper.exe' is typically associated with Microsoft Office and the files created are JavaScript files used by Office (as suggested by their names), it's likely that these events occurred during an update, download, or feature activation of Microsoft Office.\n- The repeated creation of similar files could indicate a software issue, such as a looping error during an installation process. However, without more context and timestamps, we can't definitively determine the cause.\n\nTo troubleshoot this further:\n1. Check if there are any errors or warnings in the Windows Event Log related to these file creations.\n2. Monitor the behavior of 'SDXHelper.exe' using a tool like Process Explorer to see if it's running unusually often or for extended periods.\n3.
