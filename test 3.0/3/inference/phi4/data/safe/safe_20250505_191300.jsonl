{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of regular Discord-related events, including file operations, network connections, and process activities. No anomalies or suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Process Activity**: The log records multiple actions related to the `Discord.exe` process such as creation, access, image loading, and termination. These are typical for Discord's operation.\n\n2. **File Operations**: Events include file creations and modifications within the standard user directory paths where Discord stores its data (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Discord`). This is expected behavior for application installation and usage.\n\n3. **Network Activity**: Network connections are logged, which align with Discord's functionality as a communication platform that requires network connectivity.\n\n4. **Registry Event**: A registry event related to `Discord.exe` was noted, but it does not inherently suggest malicious intent without additional context or irregularities.\n\n5. **Path and Command Line Inspection**: The paths and command lines reflect typical behavior for running Discord and its modules, with no signs of unusual activities such as attempts to access restricted areas or execute uncharacteristic commands.\n\n6. **No Anomalies Detected**: There are no signs of malware, unusual file modifications outside expected directories, unauthorized network communications, or unexpected registry changes.\n\nGiven the nature of these logs, they fall within normal operational parameters for Discord and do not indicate any malicious activities or security breaches."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains numerous events where 'Discord.exe' is involved in network connections, file creation time changes, and process accesses. Such patterns can indicate potential malicious activity or an abuse of the application for command-and-control operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n``` \n\nThis classification is based on multiple indicators of potentially suspicious behavior by 'Discord.exe', such as repeated network connections and frequent file timestamp modifications, which could signify attempts to mask activities or maintain persistence. The presence of events related to system processes like 'smartscreen.exe' and unusual tasks also adds to the interest level for further investigation. Confidence is high but not absolute due to the lack of explicit malicious indicators like known bad hashes or suspicious IP connections beyond what's logged here."}
