{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connections. That's pretty common and doesn't raise any red flags on its own since Chrome often connects to the internet.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed a few times. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access might be worth looking into, but it's not conclusive yet.\n\nThere's also whoami.exe running, which is a standard tool to check user information. Usually harmless unless used in a specific context that suggests privilege escalation.\n\nThen I notice cmd.exe being used with command lines like csc.exe, which compiles C# code. This could be part of legitimate software development or it might indicate malicious activity trying to create executables on the fly.\n\nLooking at the file events, there are several instances where files are created in temporary directories. The paths seem a bit long and include things like .exe files, which might be suspicious if they're generated unexpectedly. For example, creating an executable named 'modulo_secundario.exe' could be part of some script or tool deployment.\n\nThe registry modifications also stand out. Multiple entries show registry values being set by different processes, including powershell.exe and cmd.exe. This could indicate configuration changes for legitimate purposes, but it's also a common tactic for malware to persistence.\n\nI'm concerned about the combination of using PowerShell, cmd.exe with compilation commands, creating numerous executables in temporary folders, and modifying the registry. These activities together might suggest that an attacker is setting up a presence on the system or deploying malicious tools.\n\nWhile each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious, the overall pattern seems concerning. The repeated use of multiple processes to create files and modify system configurations could be signs of malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch definitely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creations, network connections, file operations, and registry modifications, which collectively may indicate potential malicious activities such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. The user provided a bunch of JSONL events and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. Starting with the first line: process name is calc.exe, task is Image loaded, file path points to urlmon.dll. That seems normal because Calculator often loads system DLLs.\n\nNext, svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times. Svchost is a common system process, so registry activity alone isn't suspicious unless it's doing something unusual. But in this case, it's just standard operations.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log management; it's supposed to create and manage files, so that's expected behavior.\n\nMoving on, I see ApplicationFrameHost.exe also setting registry values. Again, this is a legitimate Windows process used for desktop windows, so registry interactions are normal here.\n\nCalculator.exe sets a registry value as well. Since Calculator is a standard app, it shouldn't be doing anything malicious in the registry unless there's something specific, but nothing stands out here.\n\nPowershell.exe appears twice: once setting a registry value and another accessing a process. Powershell can do a lot, both good and bad. However, without seeing actual commands or unusual activity, this might just be normal scripting or administrative tasks.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe, there are several entries. It's creating pipes, setting registry values, loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those DLLs are legitimate parts of Windows Defender and AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), so that makes sense. The multiple RegistryEvent tasks could be related to extensions or settings within Chrome.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe appears again creating the same file. It's consistent with its log rotation process, which is normal behavior.\n\nNow, putting it all together: each process seems to be doing standard activities. No unusual processes, no unexpected files being accessed or written, and the registry activity doesn't seem out of place. All these events are within the realm of normal system operations without any red flags like access to known malicious domains, execution from untrusted paths, or writes to critical system areas.\n\nI don't see any anomalies that would raise concerns about malware or unauthorized access. Everything aligns with typical user activity and system processes on a Windows machine.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and file operations that are typical for legitimate software like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, Calculator.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. There is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
