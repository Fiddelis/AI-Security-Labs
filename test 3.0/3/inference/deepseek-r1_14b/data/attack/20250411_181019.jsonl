{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the batch of events provided is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nStarting with the first event: Process access for powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag, but on its own, it's not conclusive.\n\nThe next few events also involve powershell.exe being accessed or created. However, I notice that some of these are just process accesses without any immediate signs of malicious activity. But the repetition might indicate something suspicious, like multiple invocations which could be part of a script or persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking at another event: whoami.exe is run. That's typically used to get user information and isn't inherently malicious unless used in conjunction with other activities for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThen there's an event where cmd.exe is used with a command line that creates a service via sc create. The command includes a script path (c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1). That looks suspicious because creating a service can be part of persistence techniques, and the fact that it's trying to execute a PowerShell script could indicate malicious intent.\n\nAnother event shows cmd.exe setting registry values, which is common in malware for persistence or configuration. Services like sc create are often used by attackers to ensure their payload runs at boot.\n\nThere's also an instance where sc.exe is used with similar commands as before, again pointing towards service creation and execution of a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). This could mean the attacker is attempting to run malicious code upon system startup.\n\nMultiple events involve services.exe and svchost.exe modifying registry values. These processes are often associated with legitimate Windows operations, but repeated registry modifications can be signs of tampering or service manipulation by malware.\n\nNotably, there's an event where cmd.exe runs a command that creates a scheduled task via sc create. The script path is NonExistingScript.ps1, which likely doesn't exist, suggesting it's a way to execute arbitrary code when the service starts.\n\nOther events include Registry value sets and Image loads for various processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe. While these could be normal, the frequency and combination with other suspicious activities might indicate something more serious.\n\nThere are also instances of file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which seems unrelated to malicious activity unless it's part of log tampering, but without additional context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at all events together: multiple PowerShell accesses, cmd.exe creating services with potentially malicious scripts, repeated registry modifications, and non-standard file paths. These patterns are indicative of potential malware or attacker activity attempting to establish persistence, execute code, and cover tracks.\n\nThe confidence level is high because several red flags appear together—using known tools (cmd, sc.exe) for service creation, execution of scripts with non-existent filenames which could be indicators of malicious payload execution, and repeated actions that suggest a more complex attack rather than individual accidental or legitimate usage.\n\nSo, the batch is definitely interesting for investigation as it shows signs of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated PowerShell accesses, creation and modification of system services using cmd.exe and sc.exe, execution attempts of non-existent scripts (e.g., NonExistingScript.ps1), and numerous registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized code execution.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"high\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script injection because it has built-in administrative tools. The fact that it's being accessed several times might be suspicious, but without seeing the actual commands run, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nNext, I see a lot of Registry value set events across various processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and others. While legitimate applications do modify the Windows Registry for configuration purposes, frequent writes can sometimes indicate malicious activity trying to persistence or alter system settings.\n\nThere are also Image Load tasks loading DLLs from System32, which is normal, but I notice urlmon.dll being loaded by Calculator.exe and calc.exe. This could be a red flag because it's unusual for these benign processes to load such a specific DLL. URLMON is typically related to URL handling in browsers, so seeing it elsewhere might suggest something's off.\n\nI also spot a few File Create events from winlogbeat.exe, which seems like it's part of log shipping or monitoring software. That's generally not concerning unless there's an unusual file being created.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are some legitimate ones like chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, but they're showing Registry modifications that might be out of the ordinary. Additionally, the presence of multiple Pipe Created events from chrome.exe is something to consider, as pipes can be used for inter-process communication, potentially for malicious activities.\n\nI also notice some entries with 'File created' tasks. Without knowing what files are being created, it's hard to assess, but if they're creating new files in unexpected locations or with unusual names, that could indicate issues.\n\nIn summary, while many of these events can be normal, the repeated use of powershell.exe and Registry modifications across multiple processes raise some eyebrows. The loading of urlmon.dll by Calculator.exe is particularly concerning as it's an unexpected behavior for that process. I might want to dig deeper into these specific events, possibly look at the actual commands run in powershell.exe instances, and check if any new files or registry entries are suspiciously created.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of System Log Events**\n\n1. **PowerShell Access**: Multiple access events for powershell.exe are noted. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use can be malicious for command execution. Further investigation into the commands run would be necessary to assess potential threats.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Numerous Registry value set events across various processes (svchost.exe, chrome.exe) are present. Although normal for application configuration, excessive modifications could indicate persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes by malware.\n\n3. **DLL Loading by Calculator.exe**: The loading of urlmon.dll by Calculator.exe is unusual and suspicious. This DLL is typically related to URL handling in browsers, making its presence in this context a potential red flag.\n\n4. **File Creation Events**: File created events from winlogbeat.exe are noted but appear benign unless the files are unexpected or malicious in nature.\n\n5. **Pipe Created Events**: Pipe Created events from chrome.exe could indicate inter-process communication, which might be used for malicious purposes, warranting closer examination.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile many events are within normal operational parameters, certain activities—specifically the use of powershell.exe and Registry modifications across multiple processes—along with Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, raise concerns. Further investigation is recommended to determine if these activities indicate malicious behavior or legitimate operations."}
