{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events involving chrome.exe. There are multiple entries where chrome.exe is making network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal because browsers do that all the time when you browse the web. So, those alone don't raise any red flags.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe processes. I know PowerShell can be a powerful tool for both good and bad, so it's something to look at more closely. The events show that powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various images. That could mean legitimate scripting or, conversely, malicious activity like setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are some file operations: creating a temporary PowerShell script, then deleting it immediately. Creating and then deleting a script file quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection, which raises my suspicion. Malware often does this to clean up its tracks after executing malicious code.\n\nAlso, the command lines for these powershell.exe processes have complex paths with backslashes and multiple dots in them. For example, \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\unidade_comum\\\\..\\\\estrutura_ativo\\\\estrutura_geral_script.bat\". These kinds of paths might be an attempt to navigate up directories using \"..\", which can sometimes indicate that the script is trying to access files it shouldn't or hiding its origin.\n\nThere are multiple instances where powershell.exe starts other processes using Start-Process, each pointing to a different .bat file. This chaining could be part of a larger script execution process. If these scripts are malicious, they could be doing something harmful on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing the registry. That might not be too concerning by itself, but combined with all the PowerShell activity, it adds to the overall context that something unusual is happening.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple network connections from Chrome aren't suspicious, but the extensive use of PowerShell with file deletions, complex paths, and starting other processes could indicate malicious behavior. The fact that a script is created and then deleted quickly makes me think it's trying to hide its presence. Also, the repeated pattern in the command lines suggests some automated or pre-written script being executed, possibly for persistence or propagation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, this batch does seem interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Suspicious Activity\",\n  \"REASONS\": [\n    \"Multiple network connections and DNS queries from chrome.exe which are normal but need monitoring.\",\n    \"Extensive use of powershell.exe with file deletions, complex paths, and launching other processes indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n    \"Creation and immediate deletion of a temporary PowerShell script suggesting attempts to hide actions.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's look through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Calculator might use some settings stored in the registry. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from powershell.exe, including tasks like Registry value set and Image loaded. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate purposes but can also be malicious. However, without seeing any unusual commands or file accesses, it's hard to say right now.\n\nLooking further, there are several events from chrome.exe accessing the registry and loading images. Chrome often does this for extensions or settings, so that might not be suspicious unless there's an unusually high number of such events or access to unexpected keys.\n\nThen, I notice a process command line with \"powershell.exe & {Start-Process...}\" which suggests another script is being executed. This could indicate scripting activity, which in itself isn't bad but could be part of malicious activities if the script does something harmful.\n\nAnother event from cmd.exe running a batch file: \"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". Batch files can automate tasks, but without knowing what's inside, it's hard to tell. If this is part of normal operations, maybe not suspicious, but if it's unexpected or executing in an unusual context, it might be.\n\nThere are also events from conhost.exe and svchost.exe performing registry writes and file creations. These processes can sometimes be involved in malicious activities because they're generic and often used by malware to hide their tracks.\n\nLooking at the files being accessed, some paths seem normal (like MpClient.dll or urlmon.dll), but others like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_principal.txt\" might raise an eyebrow. Why is this file being created? Is it part of legitimate software or something else?\n\nI also notice that powershell.exe and cmd.exe are used multiple times, which could indicate repeated scripting or command execution. Malware often uses these tools to carry out tasks. The frequency and combination with other activities might be a red flag.\n\nConsidering all together: multiple writes to the registry by different processes, file creations in user directories, and the use of powershell and cmd for process creation. These are common tactics in malware to maintain persistence or execute malicious scripts. It's not one single event that stands out, but the pattern over many events suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while individual events might look benign, the combination points towards possible investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits a series of activities that, when considered collectively, suggest potential malicious behavior. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Multiple Registry Writes**: Powershell.exe and other processes write to the registry multiple times. While legitimate, this frequency could indicate attempts at persistence or configuration changes by malware.\n\n2. **Script Execution**: The use of powershell.exe to execute scripts and cmd.exe to run batch files is noted. This can be a common tactic for malicious activities, especially when combined with other indicators.\n\n3. **File Operations**: Creation of files in user directories, such as \"componente_principal.txt\", without clear legitimate justification, raises suspicion.\n\n4. **Process Activity**: The repeated use of conhost.exe and svchost.exe, often associated with malware, adds to the concern. These processes are sometimes used to execute malicious code or hide activities.\n\n5. **File Access**: Accessing system files like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll is normal but could be part of a broader attempt to interfere with system operations.\n\n**Conclusion**: While individual events may not indicate malice, the combination of registry writes, script executions, file creations in user spaces, and process activity suggests a pattern that merits further investigation. This batch is deemed interesting for potential security concerns."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event.\n\nLooking at the first few events: all of them are from chrome.exe and involve registry value sets. That's a bit concerning because writing to the registry can be a common tactic for malware to persist. But wait, Chrome itself does update its settings through the registry sometimes, so it might not necessarily be malicious. Plus, there are seven such events in a row—could that be normal?\n\nThen, I see an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting Windows logs, right? It's legitimate software, so this doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nThe last event is powershell.exe creating a file named 'elemento_base.txt'. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The filename seems arbitrary, which makes me think—could this be part of malicious activity? But again, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the user was running a script for legitimate reasons.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes from Chrome might indicate something, but it's possible they're just updates. The winlogbeat and powershell events don't add much on their own. There's no clear sign of high severity here—no account access changes, no network connections, nothing like that. So, while there are some red flags, the lack of other indicators makes me think this batch isn't particularly suspicious.\n\nI guess I'd classify it as NOT INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7 because some parts could be concerning, but not enough to warrant immediate action.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal file creation by legitimate processes and registry updates from Chrome.exe, which are typical activities that do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
