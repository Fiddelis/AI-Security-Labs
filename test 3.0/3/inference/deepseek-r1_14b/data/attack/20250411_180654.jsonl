{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and can hide malicious activities within its processes. There are several instances where powershell.exe is executed with command lines that reference .ps1 scripts located in various paths like 'C:\\\\...\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1'. The fact that these script paths vary but all point to a similar naming convention suggests they might be part of the same malicious activity or multiple attempts.\n\nAdditionally, I see multiple events where Registry values are being set by chrome.exe. While Chrome accessing the registry isn't unusual, the frequency here (seven times) could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, possibly to maintain persistence or change settings that allow for further attacks.\n\nLooking at other events, there's a process creation of whoami.exe, which is commonly used in reconnoissance to gather user information. This could be part of enumerating the environment before deploying more serious attacks.\n\nThe repeated ImageLoad tasks from powershell.exe loading various .dlls are concerning because such activity might indicate the execution of malicious scripts that need to load specific libraries for their operations.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines, registry modifications, and a whoami process create an environment that's highly indicative of potential malicious activity. The consistent pattern across different processes and the specific script names suggest this could be part of a larger attack campaign or persistence mechanism.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe processes executing scripts from various paths, suspicious registry modifications by chrome.exe, and whoami.exe execution. These activities may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The command lines show paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 which sounds suspiciousâ€”it might be designed to capture keystrokes, a classic sign of malware trying to steal information.\n\nThere's also activity around creating and deleting files in the TEMP directory. The creation and deletion of temporary script files could indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts without leaving a trace for too long.\n\nLooking at the file paths, some are pointing to network shares or unusual locations (e.g., modulo_padrao, elemento_base), which might suggest that the malware is fetching components from external sources or attempting persistence across reboots.\n\nThe events also show registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of creating persistent backdoors, allowing malicious code to run on every startup.\n\nAdditionally, there are repeated file creations by svchost.exe, which is a known process that runs services. Unusual activity from svchost can indicate malware using legitimate processes for their activities.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files might be related to log shipping or monitoring tools, but the other activities make me more cautious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances running scripts meant to capture keystrokes, temporary file creations\/deletions, registry modifications, and activity from svchost.exe. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious activity aimed at stealing information and ensuring persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances executing scripts with potential keystroke logging functionality, coupled with file creation\/deletion patterns in the TEMP directory and registry modifications, indicate suspicious activity indicative of possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
