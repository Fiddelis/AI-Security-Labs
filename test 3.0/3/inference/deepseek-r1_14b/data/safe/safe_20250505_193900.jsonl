{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n\n1. ShellExperienceHost.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That seems normal as these are Windows processes.\n2. svchost.exe set a registry value. Svchost is a common service host, so this isn't unusual.\n3. A null process with no task—maybe just an event without associated process info.\n4. Explorer.EXE setting a registry value. Again, standard activity.\n\nNext, several events from chrome.exe:\n- Process creation, pipe creation, multiple registry writes, image loads for system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These look like typical Chrome operations—loading necessary modules.\n\nThere are also some WmiPrvSE.exe and svchost.exe process creations with specific parameters. WmiPrvSE is related to WMI, which can be malicious but in this context seems normal as it's part of standard system management.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events show network connections and DNS queries, which align with web browsing activity. No signs of anomalies here like unexpected domains or too many connections.\n\nI don't see any unusual file creations or writes outside the norm. The event where winlogbeat.exe creates a config file is normal if that's a monitoring tool in use.\n\nThere are several registry writes from chrome.exe, but without seeing specific keys accessed, it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, given the context and no other red flags, these might just be Chrome's standard operations.\n\nNo events indicate failed logons, strange file accesses, or known malicious process behaviors. Everything seems within expected ranges for user activity on a system with Chrome, svchost services, and WMI processes running.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creations, registry modifications, and network connections from standard applications like Chrome and Windows services. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few entries are about chrome.exe setting registry values and creating pipes. That's normal because Chrome uses the registry for settings and might create pipes for inter-process communication. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is likely the log collector or shipper, so it making new files in its data directory makes sense. No red flags here.\n\nThen, there's an updater.exe creating a pipe and starting with some command-line arguments pointing to GoogleUpdater. That seems normal too; software updaters often check for updates and use pipes for communication.\n\nAnother event shows chrome.exe loading taskschd.dll from the system32 directory, which is standard as it's part of Windows Task Scheduler used by many applications.\n\nThen there's an svchost.exe process starting with a specific service BthAvctpSvc. Svchost is a common host process for various Windows services, so unless this service is known malicious, it's not suspicious.\n\nThe last two entries repeat actions from earlier: chrome.exe registry writes and winlogbeat creating the same file again. Repetition here doesn't indicate anything unusual; it could be normal log activity or periodic updates.\n\nLooking at all events together, none of them individually stand out as malicious, and collectively there's no pattern suggesting an attack. No anomalies in process creation, file accesses to sensitive areas, registry modifications outside the norm, or network activities that would raise flags. So, I'd classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activity such as process creation and file operations related to Chrome, updater.exe, and svchost.exe. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies in the logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
