{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be legitimate, but notepad.exe modifying the registry could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing processes and svchost.exe loading images. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. The image loaded is urlmon.dll, which is a system file, so that might be normal. However, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe. That's odd because calc.exe is just the calculator, but using it in scheduled tasks might be a way to execute commands. The command line shows creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup, which could be a sign of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there's a schtasks.exe process creating another task, and svchost.exe creating files in the Tasks directory. The file paths mentioned are in System32, which is a standard location, but creating tasks in that directory might be unusual. Also, multiple svchost.exe entries modifying registry values could indicate some kind of configuration changes, maybe to maintain access or alter system behavior.\n\nLooking at the command line of the cmd.exe process again, it's using schtasks to create tasks that execute calc.exe. While calc.exe itself isn't malicious, the way it's being triggered through scheduled tasks might be a method to run other commands. The use of \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" could be a way to execute arbitrary commands, but since calc.exe is a known legitimate file, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of svchost.exe and schtasks.exe activities. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so seeing multiple registry changes and file creations might indicate something is trying to modify system settings or create persistence. The presence of multiple scheduled tasks being created with different names (like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\") suggests that an attacker might be setting up multiple points of entry or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware here. All the processes involved are legitimate Windows components. The suspicious part is the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with calc.exe and the repeated registry modifications. While these actions alone might not be malicious, their combination could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or perform actions under the guise of normal processes.\n\nThe confidence level is a bit tricky. Since there's no outright malware or obvious malicious files, but the behavior is unusual and could be part of an attack, I'd say it's moderately suspicious. It's not a clear-cut case, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **suspicious behavior** that warrants further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Abnormal Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple `schtasks.exe` processes create scheduled tasks with names like `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon` and `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup` in the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\` directory. \n   - These tasks execute `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe`, which is unusual because:\n     - `calc.exe` (Windows Calculator) is a legitimate binary, but its use here seems **instrumental** (e.g., as a trigger for hidden payloads).\n     - Scheduled tasks with arbitrary names in system directories could indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **obfuscation**.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Behavior**:\n   - **`cmd.exe`** with a command line containing `schtasks \/create` and `calc.exe`:\n     - While `cmd.exe` is a standard tool, its use here may be part of a **command-and-control (C2) chain** or **payload execution**.\n   - **`svchost.exe`** repeatedly modifying registry keys and creating files in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\`. This could indicate **tampering with system services** or **registry hijacking**.\n\n3. **Lateral Movement or Persistence**:\n   - The creation of multiple scheduled tasks with unique names (e.g., `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`) suggests **persistent access** or **post-exploitation activity**.\n   - The use of `svchost.exe` and `schtasks.exe` (both legitimate tools) could be part of **living-off-the-land (LotL)** tactics.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious**:\n- **Legitimate**:\n  - `chrome.exe` performing DNS queries and network connections is normal.\n  - `svchost.exe` and `schtasks.exe` are standard Windows utilities.\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - The **repeated use of `calc.exe`** in scheduled tasks is highly unusual.\n  - **File creation in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\`** (a protected system directory) by `svchost.exe` is atypical.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Investigate Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Check the contents of the created tasks (e.g., `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`) to confirm if they execute malicious payloads.\n   - Use tools like `schtasks \/query` or PowerShell to inspect task details.\n\n2. **Analyze `svchost.exe` Activity**:\n   - Monitor which services are hosted by `svchost.exe` to detect unexpected behavior (e.g., network connections to unknown IPs).\n\n3. **Check for Obfuscation**:\n   - The task names (`modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`) suggest **non-English naming conventions**, which may indicate obfuscation or multi-lingual attack patterns.\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Look for **failed login attempts**, **unusual network traffic**, or **process injection** in adjacent logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe activity is **moderately suspicious** and likely part of an **attack chain** involving **persistence** and **Living-off-the-Land (LotL)** tactics. While no direct malware is evident, the combination of unusual scheduled tasks, `svchost.exe` anomalies, and `calc.exe` usage merits **further investigation** to rule out compromise. \n\n**Confidence Level**: **High suspicion** (70â€“80% likelihood of benign activity, but requires deeper analysis)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and whoami.exe. The winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the Downloads directory, which might be normal, but I should note that. Then, there are multiple registry value set events. A lot of them are from chrome.exe. That's unusual because chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much. Maybe something is wrong here.\n\nAlso, there are image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, but loading them multiple times could be a sign of something. Wait, but the events are from chrome.exe. Is chrome trying to load those DLLs? That might be normal if it's interacting with Defender, but maybe not. Need to check if that's typical behavior.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a standard command to get user info. But it's created as a separate process. The command line is quoted, which might be normal. However, the presence of whoami.exe alone isn't suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe events, there's a file created called unidade_ativo.txt. That could be a benign file, but maybe it's part of some activity. Also, there are multiple Process accessed events for powershell.exe. Accessing processes could be part of normal operations, but if it's accessing other processes in a way that's not typical, that's a red flag.\n\nThe chrome.exe is involved in a lot of registry changes. Normally, browsers might modify some registry keys for settings, but the frequency here seems high. Maybe an exploit or a malicious script is running through chrome, causing excessive registry modifications. Also, the Pipe Created event for chrome.exe might be related to inter-process communication, but again, if it's happening a lot, that's suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is that winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup, but if it's in the Downloads directory, maybe someone manually placed it there. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry changes from chrome.exe, which isn't typical, plus some process accesses and file creation. The presence of whoami.exe and powershell.exe doing various tasks might be part of a larger attack, like trying to escalate privileges or access sensitive information. However, some of these events could be benign. But the combination of unusual registry activity from chrome and multiple process accesses might indicate a potential security issue. So, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual Chrome.exe Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Registry Modifications:** Chrome.exe is involved in numerous `Registry Value Set` events. While Chrome may modify the registry for settings, the volume and frequency here are atypical and could indicate tampering or exploitation (e.g., a malicious script or extension).\n   - **Pipe Creation:** A `Pipe Created` event linked to Chrome.exe may suggest inter-process communication (IPC) for legitimate purposes, but excessive or unexplained IPC could hint at covert operations.\n\n2. **PowerShell.exe Anomalies:**\n   - **File Creation:** A file named `unidade_ativo.txt` is created in the user's Downloads directory. While benign in isolation, this could be part of data exfiltration or logging if paired with other malicious activity.\n   - **Process Access Events:** Multiple `Process Accessed` events for PowerShell.exe may indicate attempts to interact with or monitor other processes, which could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\n3. **Whoami.exe Execution:**\n   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is a standard command to retrieve user identity. However, its presence in this context (without clear justification) could be a precursor to privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat.exe File Creation:**\n   - The creation of a `winlogbeat.yml.new` file in the Downloads directory might be part of a configuration update, but manual placement of such files in non-standard directories could indicate tampering or unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malicious Chrome Extension or Exploit:** Excessive registry changes from Chrome.exe could signal a compromised browser or exploit.\n- **Command-and-Control (C2) Communication:** The combination of PowerShell activity and registry modifications might suggest C2 traffic or data exfiltration.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** The use of `whoami.exe` and PowerShell process access could be steps toward escalating privileges or accessing sensitive systems.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate Chrome.exe Activity:** Check Chrome's extensions, logs, and network traffic for signs of compromise.\n- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:** Review the contents of `unidade_ativo.txt` and any PowerShell scripts executed to determine their purpose.\n- **Audit Winlogbeat Configuration:** Verify the legitimacy of the `winlogbeat.yml.new` file and ensure no unauthorized changes were made.\n- **Monitor for Lateral Movement:** Check for additional suspicious processes or network connections that could indicate further exploitation.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **interesting and warrants investigation** due to the combination of unusual Chrome.exe behavior, PowerShell anomalies, and potential signs of privilege escalation. While some events could be benign, the overall pattern suggests a need for deeper analysis to rule out malicious intent."}
