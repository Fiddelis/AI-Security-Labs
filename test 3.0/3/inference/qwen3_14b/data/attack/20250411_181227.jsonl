{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process commands, there are several entries with PowerShell commands that create scheduled tasks. Each of these commands is using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a common trick used in malware to test if the scheduled task works. The triggers are set to run at logon, which means the task will execute every time a user logs in. The principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level, which gives the task elevated privileges. That's a red flag because normally, you wouldn't want a scheduled task running as administrators with high privileges unless it's a legitimate administrative task.\n\nNow, the names of the scheduled tasks are things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", \"tarefa_base\", etc. These names don't seem to be standard or well-known, which might indicate they're custom-created, possibly by an attacker. The repetition of similar commands across multiple events suggests a pattern, which could be part of a larger attack or just a test. However, the fact that it's happening multiple times might be more concerning.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events related to PowerShell, including registry value sets and process accesses. The image loaded events include .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, and while they are legitimate, their loading in the context of PowerShell could be part of a more complex attack, such as using .NET to execute malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just normal operations.\n\nBut wait, the main thing here is the scheduled tasks. Creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges that run calc.exe at logon is suspicious. Even though calc.exe is a benign executable, using it in this way could be a test to see if the task is properly configured. However, in a real attack, the payload would be something more malicious. The fact that this is happening multiple times and with different task names might indicate that the attacker is trying to establish persistence on the system.\n\nAnother point is that the events include both process create and image load events. The image loads are from .NET components, which could be part of the PowerShell execution, but again, without seeing the actual code being run, it's hard to be certain. However, the combination of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and the use of PowerShell, which is a common tool for attackers, raises concerns.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the key indicators are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges running at logon, using PowerShell, and the presence of .NET DLLs being loaded. These are all signs that could be part of a malicious activity, even if calc.exe itself is not harmful. The repetition and the elevated privileges make this more suspicious. Therefore, this batch of events is likely worth investigating further to determine if there's an actual security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potential malicious activity** and warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands create **scheduled tasks** with:\n     - **`calc.exe`** as the payload (a common test or indicator of compromise).\n     - **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** as the principal (elevated privileges).\n     - **`AtLogon`** triggers (ensures persistence across user logins).\n   - **Task names** (e.g., `tarefa_geral`, `registro_geral`) are non-standard and may be custom-named by an attacker.\n\n2. **Repetition of Patterns**:\n   - The same PowerShell script is repeated across multiple events, suggesting **automation or testing** of the attack vector.\n\n3. **.NET DLL Loads in PowerShell Context**:\n   - Events show loading of .NET components (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc.), which are legitimate but often used in **malicious PowerShell scripts** to execute payloads (e.g., via `Start-Process` or `Invoke-Expression`).\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**:\n   - No benign context (e.g., software installation, system updates) is indicated for these tasks or DLL loads.\n   - The use of **PowerShell for persistence** (scheduled tasks) is a common tactic in post-exploitation phases.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**:\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: Scheduled tasks with elevated privileges are a **common method for attackers to maintain access** to a system.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Running as `Administrators` could allow lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: The combination of PowerShell, `.NET` libraries, and non-standard task names aligns with known attack patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**:\n1. **Investigate the Source of the PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Check logs for the origin of the PowerShell sessions (e.g., remote access, user activity).\n   - Look for signs of **unauthorized access** (e.g., brute-force attempts, lateral movement).\n\n2. **Analyze the Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Inspect the actual content of the tasks (e.g., via `schtasks \/query` or the registry) to confirm if they are benign or malicious.\n\n3. **Monitor for .NET-Based Payloads**:\n   - Investigate if the loaded .NET DLLs are being used to execute arbitrary code (e.g., via `reflection`, `CLR hosting`, or `PowerShell remoting`).\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for other suspicious activity (e.g., network connections to external IPs, file modifications, or user account anomalies).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis batch of events **strongly suggests a potential security incident**, likely involving **malicious use of PowerShell for persistence and privilege escalation**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm whether this is a **test, false positive, or actual attack**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory, which seems normal. Then, a file is created in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then that same file is deleted. That could be part of a normal process, like a temporary script being used and then cleaned up. But I should check if there's anything unusual about the script's name or content.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Then, the command line shows a PowerShell script that's creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, which is a common test application, but the trigger is at logon and the user is set to Administrators with high privileges. That might be suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. If it's a legitimate Chrome update, that's normal, but if it's modifying registry keys related to security or other processes, that might be malicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed, so it's hard to tell. But multiple registry changes could indicate some form of configuration change.\n\nThen there's a bunch of events where the process is None, and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's a red flag. If the process field is None, it might mean the event is from a source that doesn't track the process, but having multiple remote command executions could indicate a remote attack or a command and control server communicating with the system.\n\nLooking back at the PowerShell command, the script is registering a scheduled task with \"calc.exe\" but that's just an example. However, the user might be using this as a test, but in a real scenario, this could be a way to execute malicious code under admin privileges. The fact that there are multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events without any associated process is concerning. It might indicate that the system is being controlled remotely, which is a strong indicator of a security incident.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell creating a high-privilege scheduled task, multiple remote command executions, and registry modifications might be signs of an attack. However, some of these could be false positives or legitimate activities. But the presence of \"Execute a Remote Command\" without a process is a strong indicator that something is wrong. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n### **1. PowerShell Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges**\n- **Event Example**:  \n  ```powershell\n  $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n  $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n  $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest\n  Register-ScheduledTask unidade_comum$object\n  ```\n- **Analysis**:  \n  - This script creates a scheduled task that runs **`calc.exe`** (a benign utility) under the **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** group with **`RunLevel Highest`** (admin privileges).  \n  - While `calc.exe` is harmless, the **elevation of privileges** and **triggering at logon** could indicate a **privilege escalation attempt** or a **backdoor** (e.g., replacing `calc.exe` with a malicious payload).  \n  - The task name (`unidade_comum`) is nonsensical and may be obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### **2. \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events Without Process Context**\n- **Event Example**:  \n  ```plaintext\n  \"task\": \"Execute a Remote Command\", \"process\": \"None\"\n  ```\n- **Analysis**:  \n  - **30+ entries** of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with **no associated process** are highly suspicious.  \n  - This could indicate **remote code execution (RCE)**, **command-and-control (C2) communication**, or **log tampering** (e.g., the process field being stripped for obfuscation).  \n  - The absence of a process name suggests **incomplete logging** or **malicious activity evading detection**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. PowerShell Script Creation and Deletion in Temp Directory**\n- **Event Example**:  \n  - A PowerShell script (`*.ps1`) is created in the **`Temp`** directory and immediately deleted.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Temporary script creation\/deletion is common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., one-time tasks).  \n  - However, **combined with other suspicious events** (e.g., remote commands, elevation), this could indicate **malware execution** or **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Chrome.exe Registry Modifications**\n- **Event Example**:  \n  - Multiple entries of **`chrome.exe` modifying registry keys**.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - While Chrome updates may modify the registry, **repeated changes** without clear context could indicate **registry-based persistence** (e.g., adding startup entries or altering security policies).  \n  - No specific registry keys are logged, so further analysis is required to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Pipe Creation Event**\n- **Event Example**:  \n  - A **pipe creation** event with no file context.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Pipes are often used for **inter-process communication (IPC)** but can also be exploited for **data exfiltration** or **malicious communication**.  \n  - No additional context (e.g., destination, data) is provided, so this requires correlation with other logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Investigate Further**\n- **High-Risk Indicators**:  \n  - **Remote command execution** without process context.  \n  - **Scheduled task creation** with admin privileges.  \n  - **Unusual registry modifications** by `chrome.exe`.  \n\n- **Recommended Actions**:  \n  1. **Check for `calc.exe` or other binaries** being replaced with malicious payloads.  \n  2. **Analyze network traffic** for C2 communication (e.g., unusual outbound connections).  \n  3. **Inspect the registry** for persistent modifications.  \n  4. **Correlate events** with endpoint detection\/response (EDR) tools to identify the source of the \"None\" process entries.  \n\nThis batch **strongly suggests a potential security incident** and requires immediate investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes malware uses legitimate processes. However, just loading a standard DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes can be normal. But repeated registry modifications might indicate something, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, there's a File created event for 'unidade_comum' in the Tasks directory. That path seems a bit odd. The name 'unidade_comum' doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows file. Maybe it's a typo or a malicious file. Also, the user 'fiddelis' might be a red herring, but the file path is in System32\\\\Tasks, which is a common location for scheduled tasks. If an unauthorized file is created there, that could be a sign of a scheduled task being added by an attacker.\n\nThen there's a process with no name executing a remote command. That's concerning. If the process field is None, it might mean the event didn't capture the process name, which could be a sign of something evading detection. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But multiple entries of 'Execute a Remote Command' without a process might indicate command and control activity.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files like 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' and 'entrada_principal.txt' could be normal, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. However, creating a startup profile might be part of a legitimate configuration. The other file, 'objeto_auxiliar.txt', is just a text file, so maybe not harmful.\n\nChrome.exe has several registry value set events. Chrome is a common browser, and registry changes could be from extensions or updates. But if there's a lot of them, it might be worth checking. Also, Chrome loading amsi.dll and MpOAT.dll (assuming MpOAT is part of the name) could be legitimate since those are related to antivirus and security features. However, if those DLLs are being loaded from unexpected locations, that's a problem. But the logs don't mention the paths, so I can't be sure.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file is probably part of its normal operation when configuring. The file path is in the downloads directory, which is common for user-installed software. But if the user didn't install it, that might be an issue. However, the presence of winlogbeat suggests that someone is monitoring logs, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nLooking for other signs: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, but that's not unusual. The repeated registry events might not be a big red flag unless they're modifying specific keys related to security or system settings.\n\nThe key points here are the 'Execute a Remote Command' without a process, the suspicious file in the Tasks directory, and the multiple registry changes. However, without more context, it's hard to confirm if these are malicious. But considering the presence of a file in a system directory that's not commonly seen and the remote command execution without a process, there might be something to investigate. However, the logs don't show obvious signs of malware or attacks. It's a bit of a toss-up. Maybe the answer is that it's not clearly malicious, but there are some unusual events that could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not clearly indicate a security threat or malicious activity, but there are **several unusual patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious File Creation in System Directories**\n- **Event**: `File created` for `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new` (repeated twice).\n  - **Analysis**: This appears to be part of a legitimate Winlogbeat configuration process, but the file path (`data\/.winlogbeat.yml.new`) suggests a temporary configuration file being written. No immediate threat here, but ensure the file is expected and associated with a legitimate Winlogbeat installation.\n\n- **Event**: `File created` for `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_principal.txt` and `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_auxiliar.txt`.\n  - **Analysis**: These are generic text files. While not inherently malicious, their creation in the `Downloads` folder by `powershell.exe` could be part of normal user activity or data transfer. No obvious signs of compromise.\n\n- **Event**: `File created` for `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new` (repeated).\n  - **Analysis**: Duplicate entries may indicate a benign configuration process, but repeated logging of the same file could suggest monitoring or logging tool activity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual Registry Modifications**\n- **Events**: Multiple entries of `Registry value set` by `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe`.\n  - **Analysis**: \n    - **Chrome**: Registry changes by Chrome are often due to extensions, updates, or user preferences. However, **frequent or large-scale changes** could indicate tampering (e.g., injection of malicious extensions or hijacking of browser behavior).\n    - **svchost.exe**: This process hosts Windows services. While registry modifications are common, **unusual or repetitive changes** could signal an attack (e.g., persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Lack of Process Information in Remote Command Events**\n- **Events**: `Execute a remote command` with `process` field set to `None`.\n  - **Analysis**: This is **highly suspicious**. The absence of a process name could indicate:\n    - **Log parsing errors** (e.g., incomplete data).\n    - **Malware evasion** (e.g., processes hiding their identity).\n    - **Command-and-control (C2) activity** (e.g., attackers executing commands without leaving traces).\n  - **Recommendation**: Investigate the source of these events to confirm if this is a data gap or a potential security issue.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Chrome and Winlogbeat Activity**\n- **Chrome**: Multiple `Registry value set` events and `Dns query` activity.\n  - **Analysis**: Chrome's DNS queries are normal, but **unusual domains** or high volume could indicate exfiltration or phishing. No specific domains are listed here, so further analysis would be needed.\n- **Winlogbeat**: File creation in the `data` directory is part of its normal operation (e.g., configuration files). No immediate threat detected.\n\n---\n\n### **5. No Clear Signs of Malware or Exploitation**\n- **No** indicators of **malware execution**, **unauthorized access**, or **exploitation attempts** (e.g., failed logins, unusual network traffic, or process anomalies).\n- **No** evidence of **data exfiltration**, **file encryption**, or **system compromise** (e.g., ransomware signs).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not confirm a security incident**, but they highlight **ambiguous activity** that could merit further investigation:\n- **Verify the legitimacy** of the `Execute a remote command` events with `process=None`.\n- **Audit registry changes** by `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` for anomalies.\n- **Monitor the files** created in the `Downloads` folder (e.g., check their contents and origin).\n\nIf these events are part of a **benign configuration or logging process**, no action is needed. However, if they are **unexplained or untrusted**, deeper forensic analysis is recommended."}
