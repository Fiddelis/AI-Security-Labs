{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nLooking at the data, there are several entries with processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe. Some of them have command lines that stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe process that runs a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That seems suspicious because deleting processes isn't typical for normal operations. Also, WMIC.exe is being used here, which is often associated with remote management but can be abused for malicious activities.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the use of urlmon.dll and amsi.dll in image load events. These are system files, but if they're being loaded from unexpected places or in unusual contexts, it might indicate something malicious. However, in this case, the paths are standard system directories, so maybe that's normal. But combined with other activities, it could be a red flag.\n\nThere's also a file created event for a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That might be part of a setup or configuration, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of winlogbeat.exe suggests that this might be related to log management, which is normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be relevant.\n\nThe repeated registry value set events by svchost.exe and other processes might be normal system behavior, but if they're happening in a short time frame or in combination with other suspicious activities, they could indicate something like a registry-based payload or persistence mechanism.\n\nHowever, I don't see any clear signs of a successful attack or malicious activity. The events seem to be a mix of normal system processes and some potentially suspicious commands. The key is whether these events together form a pattern that's indicative of a security incident. Since the cmd.exe command is trying to delete processes, and WMIC is involved, this could be part of an attack, but without more evidence like network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch has some suspicious elements but not enough to be certain. The confidence might be around 0.6. The classification is INTERESTING because there are potential indicators of compromise, but more data would be needed for confirmation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'cmd.exe' executing a WMIC command to delete 'notepad.exe' processes, which may indicate process manipulation. 2) 'WMIC.exe' loading system DLLs (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll) that could be part of malicious payload execution. 3) Repeated 'Registry value set' events by svchost.exe and other processes, potentially indicating registry-based persistence or configuration changes.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are related to processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and some others. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. Now, I know that normal system operations can generate these events, but certain patterns might indicate malicious activity.\n\nHmm, I see multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. Then there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". Wait, that looks like someone is replacing the Sticky Keys executable with a backup file. That's a common technique used in attacks to replace system files with malicious ones, like the well-known \"evil twin\" attack where sethc.exe is replaced with a malicious payload.\n\nAnother entry has \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", which is deleting a scheduled task. Deleting a task might be part of cleaning up after an attack or avoiding detection. Also, there's a process create event for schtasks.exe, which is used to manage scheduled tasks. If an attacker is creating or deleting tasks, that's suspicious.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe command being executed multiple times. While whoami is a legitimate tool to check user context, if it's being called repeatedly, that might indicate the attacker is checking their privileges or trying to escalate.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of these events: multiple process creations, registry changes, and the specific commands related to replacing system files and manipulating scheduled tasks. This seems like a coordinated set of actions that could be part of a larger attack. The presence of both PowerShell and cmd.exe commands, along with registry modifications, suggests that the attacker is trying to modify system settings and execute commands, which are typical in malware activities.\n\nHowever, I should consider if these could be benign. For example, a user might be testing scripts or using legitimate tools. But the specific command to replace sethc.exe with a backup file is a known attack vector. Also, the repetition of certain events and the use of multiple command-line tools increase the likelihood of malicious intent.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the combination of these events, especially the replacement of system files and manipulation of scheduled tasks, points towards a potential security threat. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Malicious File Replacement:**\n   - A command was executed to replace the legitimate `sethc.exe` (Sticky Keys utility) with a file named `sethc_backup.exe`:\n     ```\n     cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\n     ```\n   - This is a **classic attack technique** (e.g., \"evil twin\" attack) where attackers replace system utilities with malicious payloads to execute arbitrary code when the user triggers the utility (e.g., via Shift+5).\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Manipulation:**\n   - A command to delete a scheduled task named `win32times` was executed:\n     ```\n     schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\n     ```\n   - Deleting tasks could indicate an attempt to **remove traces of malicious activity** or avoid detection by security tools.\n\n3. **Frequent Use of PowerShell and `cmd.exe`:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` were executed, often with obfuscated or suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., `cmd.exe \/c`).\n   - PowerShell is a common tool for **payload execution, lateral movement, and data exfiltration** in attacks.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Frequent \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added\/deleted\" events were logged, which could indicate **tampering with system settings** or persistence mechanisms (e.g., modifying startup keys).\n\n5. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - `schtasks.exe` was executed with a command-line argument (`\/delete \/f`), which is not typical for legitimate system operations.\n   - `svchost.exe` (a standard Windows process) was involved in a \"Registry object added\/deleted\" event, which could signal **malicious code injection** or persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Likely Scenario:**\nThe events suggest a **multi-stage attack** involving:\n- **Persistence:** Using registry modifications or scheduled tasks to maintain access.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** Replacing system utilities (e.g., `sethc.exe`) to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n- **Command-and-Control (C2):** Using PowerShell or `cmd.exe` for further exploitation or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `sethc.exe` replacement:**\n   - Check the integrity of `sethc.exe` using tools like **Windows Defender** or **SIEM** alerts.\n   - Analyze the contents of `sethc_backup.exe` (if still present) for malicious code.\n\n2. **Audit Scheduled Tasks:**\n   - Verify the existence and purpose of the deleted `win32times` task.\n   - Look for other suspicious or unauthorized tasks.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell and `cmd.exe` Usage:**\n   - Use **audit logs** or **EDR tools** to trace the origin of commands and identify potential lateral movement.\n\n4. **Check for Registry Tampering:**\n   - Review registry keys under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` or similar locations for persistence indicators.\n\n5. **Perform a Full System Scan:**\n   - Use antivirus\/malware scanners to detect potential threats related to the replaced `sethc.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and likely indicates a **malicious attack**. Immediate investigation is required to determine the scope of compromise and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: cmd.exe is involved in a Registry value set event. That's common for normal operations, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading that might be normal, but MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. However, if chrome.exe is loading these, maybe that's unexpected? Or maybe it's just part of some legitimate process. Hmm.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe doing registry value sets. PowerShell is often used in attacks, but again, it's also used for legitimate tasks. The command lines don't seem too suspicious here. There's a whoami.exe being executed, which is normal for checking user identity. But the repeated registry changes and process accesses might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the file creation event: powershell.exe created a temporary script file in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files, but it's also used by legitimate software. However, the filename is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_... which might be related to PowerShell script execution policies. Maybe that's part of a test, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nNow, considering the overall pattern: multiple registry modifications, process accesses, and image loads. The fact that PowerShell is involved in creating a script file in Temp might be more concerning. Also, the repeated use of 'Registry value set' events could indicate attempts to modify system settings or evade detection. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But in the absence of clear indicators of compromise, maybe it's just normal activity. Wait, but the presence of the script file creation might be a sign of something. Maybe the script is being used to execute commands or download payloads. However, the logs don't show the actual content of the script or any network activity, so it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother point: the image loads for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET classes. So that might not be suspicious on its own. But combined with the registry changes and the script file, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nIn summary, while there are some potentially suspicious activities (like the script file creation and multiple registry changes), they might not be enough to confirm a security incident without additional context. However, the presence of these events could warrant further investigation, especially if they're occurring in an environment where such activity is not typical. So, the answer would be that the batch shows some potentially suspicious behavior that merits further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Normal Activity**\n- **Legitimate Processes**: \n  - `chrome.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) is expected during malware scanning or security checks.\n  - `.NET assemblies` (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are standard for PowerShell scripts interacting with the .NET framework.\n  - `whoami.exe` execution is a benign utility for checking user identity.\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Patterns**\n- **Frequent Registry Modifications**:\n  - Multiple entries involving `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` modifying registry values could indicate attempts to alter system behavior, bypass security policies, or persist malware. While registry edits are common, the **frequency** and **lack of clear context** (e.g., no `Hive` or `Key` details) raise concerns.\n\n- **Script File Creation**:\n  - A PowerShell process created a temporary script file in `%TEMP%`:  \n    `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`.  \n    - The filename suggests a **script policy test**, which might be legitimate (e.g., testing execution policies). However, **temporary files** in `%TEMP%` are often used by malware for persistence or payload execution.  \n    - **No evidence of the script's content** (e.g., no `FileContent` or `Command` details) limits definitive conclusions.\n\n- **Repeated Process Accesses and Image Loads**:\n  - Frequent `Process accessed` events for `powershell.exe` and `Image loaded` events for .NET components may indicate **script execution** or **malicious payload delivery**. However, this is also consistent with legitimate administrative tasks.\n\n### **3. Risk Assessment**\n- **Low- to Medium-Risk Indicators**:\n  - The combination of **unusual registry activity**, **temporary script creation**, and **repeated PowerShell usage** could suggest **malicious behavior** (e.g., lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration).  \n  - However, **no direct evidence** (e.g., network connections, suspicious commands, or anomalies in file content) confirms malicious intent.\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Additional Logs**: \n  - Check for **network activity** (e.g., DNS queries, HTTP\/HTTPS requests) from the affected system to identify potential C2 communication.\n  - Review **file content** of the temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) if accessible.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:\n  - Use **PowerShell logging** (e.g., `Transcripting`, `Module Logging`) to track script execution and detect anomalies.\n- **Check Registry Changes**:\n  - Investigate specific **registry keys\/paths** modified by `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` for signs of persistence or configuration changes.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the log entries alone do not confirm a security incident, the **unusual frequency of registry edits**, **temporary script creation**, and **heavy PowerShell usage** are **red flags** that merit further analysis. A deeper investigation into the **script content**, **network activity**, and **registry modifications** is essential to determine if this represents benign activity or a potential threat."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first event is a file delete logged by PowerShell, specifically deleting a script in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because deleting temporary files might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be malicious. However, there's only one such event here.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be part of normal operations, but repeated entries could indicate something. However, the command line is just \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems like a placeholder or test command. Maybe they're testing scripts or checking for errors.\n\nAnother event shows a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That's probably legitimate, just part of normal operations. Then there's a Pipe Created event, which could be benign, but sometimes attackers use named pipes for communication.\n\nLooking at the registry events and process accesses, nothing immediately stands out. The \"whoami.exe\" process is a standard tool for checking user identity, so that's normal. The other PowerShell commands are checking for the existence of various batch files. The paths here are a bit odd with the \"..\\\" directories, which might be trying to access parent directories, but if the scripts aren't found, they exit with 1. This could be part of a script that's looking for specific files, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, the repetition of similar PowerShell commands checking different paths might indicate automated probing or scanning for specific files. The use of multiple paths with \"..\\\" could be an attempt to traverse directories, which might be part of a larger attack, like looking for configuration files or trying to access sensitive areas.\n\nBut considering all the events, most of them seem to be either normal operations (like file creation by winlogbeat, registry changes) or test commands. The only potentially suspicious event is the file deletion in the Temp directory. However, since there's no other evidence of malicious activity, like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or unusual network activity, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because while there are some oddities, they might not be enough to confirm malicious intent. The justification would be that there's a single file deletion and several PowerShell commands checking for files, but without more context or additional suspicious events, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with suspicious command-line patterns (e.g., checking existence of files with '..\\\\' path traversal) and one file deletion in Temp directory, which could indicate probing or cleanup related to malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about PowerShell processes. There's a lot of 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's normal because PowerShell often uses these when running scripts. But then there's also a couple of 'File created' and 'File deleted' events in the Temp directory. The files created are temporary script files, which might be normal, but the fact that they're being created and then deleted quickly could be a red flag. Sometimes attackers create temporary files to execute malicious code and then clean up after themselves.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the PowerShell commands are checking if certain batch files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned like 'C:\\pacote_ativo\\unidade_principal..' and similar ones don't look standard. They might be trying to access files in non-standard directories, which could indicate something is wrong. Also, the use of '..' in the paths suggests they're navigating up directories, which might be part of a path traversal attack.\n\nThere are also multiple 'Registry value set' events from Chrome, but that's a lot of them. Maybe Chrome is updating some settings, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. However, the majority of the events are still related to PowerShell, which is a common vector for attacks.\n\nThe presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded isn't necessarily bad, but if an attacker is trying to bypass defenses, that could be a concern. However, the logs don't show any direct evidence of that here.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities, the temporary files created and deleted, and the non-standard paths might indicate some suspicious behavior. However, without more context or evidence of actual malicious activity (like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. But given the patterns observed, it's leaning towards being interesting enough to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line patterns checking for non-standard paths, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET framework DLLs may indicate potential script-based attacks or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

That's common, but when combined with other events, it might indicate something. There are several entries with 'Registry value set' and 'Process Create' tasks. But what stands out are the command_line fields in some of the processes. \n\nFor example, one event has a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content to create a file and write \"dir\" into another. This seems like it's creating batch files and writing commands. The paths mentioned are a bit all over the place, which might be a red flag. Also, there are multiple instances of similar commands being executed, which could be part of an automated process.\n\nAnother thing is the loading of various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. While these are legitimate, the combination with PowerShell activities might suggest something more. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is a legitimate component, so that's probably not malicious.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to create files and set content could be part of a script that's trying to execute commands or modify the system. The fact that there are multiple such events with similar patterns might indicate an attempt to persist or execute malicious code. However, the commands themselves are simple (like \"dir\"), which are benign. But the frequency and the paths used might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be part of normal operations, but combined with the other events, it's possible that this is a script trying to do something more than just run \"dir\". The creation of temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory is common, but if that's the only thing happening, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that while the individual events might not be alarming, the combination of multiple PowerShell commands creating files and writing to various locations could be indicative of an attempt to execute a larger script or payload. The presence of multiple similar command_line entries suggests a pattern that might not be normal user behavior.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the command_line entries are writing \"dir\" into the files. That's a harmless command. However, the fact that they are creating so many files in different directories might be a way to obfuscate or test script execution policies. The file named __PSScriptPolicyTest... could be related to testing execution policies, which might be part of a legitimate script, but again, the pattern is unusual.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch might be interesting for investigation because of the repeated PowerShell activities and file creations, even if the individual commands are benign. The analyst might want to check if these activities are part of a legitimate process or if there's an underlying malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **High Frequency:** Multiple events involve `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments creating files and writing content (e.g., `New-Item`, `Set-Content`). While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its frequent use in this context could indicate scripting or automation.\n   - **Command Patterns:** The commands (e.g., `New-Item \"C:\\path\\file.bat\"`, `Set-Content -Path \"C:\\path\\file.bat\" -Value \"dir\"`) are simple and benign (e.g., writing the `dir` command). However, the **repetition** and **unusual file paths** (e.g., nested directories like `C:\\componente_geral\\modulo_secundario\\..`) may suggest obfuscation or testing.\n\n2. **File Creation:**\n   - **Temporary Files:** A file created in `%TEMP%` (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) is named with a pattern (`__PSScriptPolicyTest`) commonly associated with **PowerShell execution policy testing**. While this could be legitimate, it might also be a precursor to bypassing security restrictions.\n   - **Scattered Paths:** Files are created in non-standard, deeply nested directories (e.g., `C:\\elemento_secundario\\elemento_secundario\\..`). This could be an attempt to evade detection or mimic legitimate scripts.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:**\n   - **Legitimate Components:** Events involving `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are normal for PowerShell execution. However, the presence of **Windows Defender's `MpOAV.dll** (part of the antimalware service) is benign but could be a red herring if malicious activity is occurring alongside it.\n\n4. **Event Types:**\n   - **Registry and File Operations:** Events like `Registry value set`, `File created`, and `Provider Lifecycle` are typical for system changes. However, the **lack of clear purpose** (e.g., no user interaction or application context) raises questions.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The nested and non-standard paths may indicate an attempt to evade detection or mimic legitimate processes.\n- **Script Policy Testing:** The `__PSScriptPolicyTest` file suggests testing or bypassing PowerShell execution policies, which could be a prelude to malicious activity.\n- **Repetition of Patterns:** The repeated use of `New-Item` and `Set-Content` across multiple events could signal **script-based automation** or **payload delivery** (e.g., staging a larger attack).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the **unusual patterns** in PowerShell usage, **scattered file creation**, and the **potential for execution policy manipulation**. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the combination of these events merits closer scrutiny to determine if they are part of a benign process or a more complex attack chain (e.g., initial reconnaissance, persistence, or data exfiltration). Further analysis (e.g., checking the contents of created files, correlating with network activity, or reviewing user context) would be necessary to confirm legitimacy. \n\n**Recommendation:** Flag for further investigation by a security analyst or SOC team."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs in JSONL format and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like file creation, deletion, registry changes, and image loading. There are several instances where files are created or deleted in temporary directories, which might be normal, but sometimes malicious scripts use temp folders to hide their activities.\n\nLooking at the file paths, some are in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for temporary files. However, there's also a file created in C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\objeto_comum_script.bat. The names like \"objeto_comum_script.bat\" and the paths with a lot of directory jumps (like ..\\..) might be suspicious. Those could be obfuscation techniques to make the path longer and harder to track.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of PowerShell with commands that check if a file exists and then exit with 0 or 1. These could be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present, possibly checking for the presence of other scripts or payloads. The fact that multiple such checks are done in different directories might indicate some automated probing or checking for conditions before proceeding with further actions.\n\nAlso, the image loads include .NET framework DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but the combination with other events might be worth looking into. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any obvious signs like network connections, unauthorized access, or execution of suspicious payloads. It's all file system and registry operations that could be part of legitimate scripts or setup processes.\n\nBut wait, the presence of multiple file creations and deletions, especially with paths that have a lot of directory levels, might indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual location of the files. The use of \"Set-Content\" to create files and checking their existence could be part of a larger script that's being executed. However, without more context or additional events (like network traffic or process injections), it's hard to confirm if this is malicious.\n\nConsidering all that, while there are some suspicious patterns, they might not be enough to classify the batch as definitely malicious. It's on the edge, so maybe a moderate risk. But the user asked if it's interesting for investigation. Since there are multiple events that could be part of a larger attack chain, it's worth looking into further. Therefore, the answer is likely \"interesting\" but not a clear threat yet.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several patterns that warrant further investigation, though they do not conclusively indicate malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temporary Directories**:\n   - Files are created and deleted in paths like `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...` and `C:\\componente_geral\\...`, which are common for temporary files. However, the use of obfuscated paths (e.g., `..\\\\..\\\\` in directory jumps) and names like `objeto_comum_script.bat` could indicate an attempt to hide the script's purpose or evade detection.\n\n2. **PowerShell Scripting Behavior**:\n   - Multiple entries involve PowerShell commands that check for the existence of files (e.g., `Test-Path`) and exit with status codes (`exit 0\/1`). This could be part of a larger script probing for conditions (e.g., checking for prior execution, dependencies, or environment readiness).\n\n3. **Repetition of Similar Commands**:\n   - The repeated use of `Test-Path` across different directories (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`, `C:\\entrada_logico\\...`) suggests a systematic check for specific files, which might be part of a staged or conditional execution process.\n\n### **Legitimate Context**\n- **PowerShell Usage**: PowerShell is a legitimate tool, and the `.NET` image loads (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are normal for PowerShell operations.\n- **File Operations**: File creation and deletion in temporary directories are common during software installation, scripting, or cleanup processes.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not definitively point to malicious activity, the **combination of obfuscated paths, repetitive file checks, and PowerShell usage** raises **moderate suspicion**. These patterns could be part of a benign process or a more complex attack chain (e.g., initial reconnaissance, payload deployment). **Further investigation** (e.g., correlating with network logs, process tree analysis, or file content inspection) is warranted to determine if this is a false positive or a potential threat.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** due to the suspicious patterns, but no conclusive evidence of malicious intent is present."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist, like Test-Path. The commands are structured similarly, each checking a different path. For example, one checks \"C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..\\\" and another checks \"C:\\tarefa_logico\\elemento_logico\\..\\\". The paths seem to have a pattern with directories like modulo_geral, estrutura_geral, and so on. The use of '..' in the paths might indicate that they're trying to navigate up directories, which could be a red flag if they're trying to access parent directories that shouldn't be accessible.\n\nThen there are events related to file creation and deletion. One event shows a file being created in the Temp directory, then immediately deleted. That's common in some legitimate scenarios, like temporary script execution, but it can also be a sign of malicious activity where the file is used briefly and then removed to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing is the loading of DLLs from Windows Defender's directory. The events mention MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. While these are legitimate Defender components, if there's an unusual number of such events or if they're being loaded in unexpected contexts, it might be worth looking into. However, in this case, it's just a couple of ImageLoad events, which might be normal.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a standard tool for checking user context. That's probably just a legitimate command, unless it's part of a larger suspicious sequence.\n\nThe repetition of similar PowerShell commands checking various paths might be part of a script that's probing the file system for specific files. If these paths are part of a legitimate application's structure, it's okay. But if they're trying to access files that shouldn't exist or are part of a malicious payload, that's a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that multiple paths are checked could indicate that the attacker is trying to find a specific file in different locations, which is a common technique in malware to locate configuration files or other resources.\n\nAlso, the use of PowerShell for such checks is common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios. But the pattern here is a bit repetitive, which might be a sign of automated probing. However, the absence of other suspicious activities like network connections, unusual registry changes, or other process creations makes it harder to classify as definitely malicious.\n\nConsidering all this, while there are some suspicious elements like the repeated Test-Path commands and temporary file creation\/deletion, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent. It could be a legitimate script checking for the existence of various files, perhaps as part of an installation or configuration process. However, the pattern of checking multiple paths with similar structures might warrant further investigation to ensure that these are not part of a larger attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripts with `Test-Path`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check the existence of files in paths with a consistent structure (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..\\...`). \n   - **Pattern:** The paths often include nested directories with names like `modulo_geral`, `estrutura_geral`, and `bin`, followed by a `Test-Path` check. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate:** A script probing for specific binaries or configurations.\n     - **Suspicious:** A potential attempt to locate or validate the presence of files in non-standard locations, which is common in malware for payload delivery or reconnaissance.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A temporary file (`entrada_base.exe`) is created and deleted in the Temp directory. While common in some legitimate scenarios (e.g., scripts), this could also mask malicious activity (e.g., executing a payload temporarily).\n\n3. **Windows Defender DLL Loads:**\n   - `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` are loaded from the Windows Defender directory. These are legitimate components, but **unusual frequency or context** (e.g., if paired with other suspicious events) could indicate tampering or evasion techniques.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No direct evidence of malware (e.g., network connections, unusual registry changes, or process injections) is present in the logs.\n   - The `whoami.exe` process is benign and likely part of a legitimate user or system check.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** **Low to Moderate**. The repetitive `Test-Path` commands and temporary file activity are concerning but not conclusive.\n- **Recommendation:** \n  - **Investigate further** by correlating these events with:\n    - File integrity monitoring (e.g., changes to `entrada_base.exe` or similar binaries).\n    - Network traffic logs during these PowerShell executions.\n    - User context (e.g., was `whoami.exe` run by a privileged account?).\n  - **Monitor** for additional PowerShell scripts or unexpected file modifications in the directories referenced by `Test-Path`.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events alone do not confirm malicious intent, the pattern of probing file paths and temporary file operations **raises flags** that warrant closer scrutiny. This could be a **legitimate script** or an **early-stage reconnaissance phase** of an attack. Further contextual analysis is critical to determine the true nature of the activity. \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** due to the repetitive probing behavior and temporary file activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's a PowerShell process checking if a certain file exists. The command line is using Test-Path to check for \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe\". If it exists, exit 0, else exit 1. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script that's verifying dependencies. But the path has a lot of subdirectories, which might be a bit unusual, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are several events where PowerShell is accessed, and images are loaded. The files loaded include .dlls from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal because PowerShell often uses these libraries. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could be a red flag if they're loading unexpected or unknown DLLs. But in this case, the DLLs are from standard locations, so maybe not.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory, then immediately deleted. The file is a PowerShell script policy test. Creating and deleting a temporary file is common, but sometimes attackers do this to avoid leaving traces. However, since the file is named with a random string and is deleted right after, it might be a benign operation. But I should note that.\n\nThen there's another PowerShell process checking paths like \"C:\\registro_principal\\registro_temporario\\registro_secundario\\bin\\componente_secundario.exe\" and similar. These paths are structured with multiple directories, which might be a way to obfuscate the actual path. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that these checks are happening multiple times could indicate that the script is trying to locate certain executables, which might be part of a larger process.\n\nThe presence of a whoami.exe process is normal, as it's used to check the current user. But that's a standard command, so not suspicious.\n\nAnother event is a cmd.exe process checking if a file exists in the temp directory. Similar to the PowerShell checks. The command is straightforward, but again, the use of environment variables like %temp% is common.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes checking for the existence of files in various paths. These checks could be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain components are present before proceeding. However, the repeated checks and the use of multiple paths might be an attempt to bypass detection or to ensure that the necessary files are available for execution.\n\nAlso, the fact that several of these processes are creating and deleting temporary files could be an indicator of something malicious, but it's not definitive. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate application's setup or configuration process. However, without additional information, such as network activity or other system changes, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the use of \"Registry value set\" events. Changing registry values can be part of both legitimate and malicious activities. If the registry changes are related to configuring software, that's normal. But if they're modifying settings that could allow persistence or alter system behavior, that's a concern. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so I can't say for sure.\n\nIn summary, while there are some suspicious patterns like multiple file existence checks and temporary file creation\/deletion, these actions alone aren't conclusive evidence of a security threat. They could be part of a legitimate process, especially if the system is running complex applications that require such checks. However, the combination of these events might warrant further investigation to rule out any potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes several **potentially suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Existence Checks:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes use `Test-Path` to check for files in complex paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`). These paths are obfuscated and not standard, which could indicate:\n     - **Scripting for dependency verification** (e.g., ensuring required binaries exist before execution).\n     - **Obfuscation of malicious payloads** (e.g., hiding the true intent of the script).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A PowerShell script creates a temporary file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) and a `whoami.exe` process, followed by immediate deletion. This pattern is common in:\n     - **Legitimate operations** (e.g., temporary configuration files).\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., avoiding forensic traces, executing payloads in memory).\n\n3. **Loading of System DLLs:**\n   - PowerShell loads `.dll` files from trusted locations (e.g., `.NET Framework`, `Windows Defender`). While normal, **excessive or unusual DLL loading** (e.g., from non-standard paths) could indicate:\n     - **Code injection** or **DLL hijacking** if the loaded DLLs are unexpected.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events are logged. Without context, these could be:\n     - **Legitimate configuration changes**.\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries, modifying policies).\n\n5. **Use of `cmd.exe` for File Checks:**\n   - A `cmd.exe` process checks for `objeto_logico.txt` in the `%temp%` directory. This is a **common technique** for both benign and malicious scripts to verify file existence or trigger conditional logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n- **Unusual Path Structures:** The repeated use of nested directories (e.g., `registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\...`) may be an attempt to **obfuscate the true purpose** of the script.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The file existence checks and temporary file operations lack context (e.g., no associated network activity, no clear application linking these actions).\n- **Potential for Persistence:** Registry modifications and temporary file creation could be **preparatory steps for persistence** (e.g., configuring startup scripts, modifying system settings).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections, DNS queries) during these events.\n   - Look for **process tree analysis** to identify parent-child relationships (e.g., was `powershell.exe` spawned by a suspicious parent process?).\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents:**\n   - Inspect the **temporary files** (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) for malicious content (e.g., embedded scripts, encoded payloads).\n\n3. **Monitor Registry Changes:**\n   - Identify which **registry keys** are modified and their purpose (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` for persistence).\n\n4. **Check for PowerShell Scripting Patterns:**\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **SIEM correlation rules** to detect obfuscated scripts (e.g., `Invoke-Expression`, `IEX`, base64-encoded payloads).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the observed activities are **not definitively malicious**, they exhibit **patterns commonly associated with adversarial behavior** (e.g., obfuscation, temporary file usage, registry modifications). **Further investigation** is required to determine intent, especially if these events occur in isolation or correlate with other suspicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any patterns or suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with 'powershell.exe' being accessed or created. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events are frequent here. But just having a lot of PowerShell activity isn't necessarily bad. However, I should check for any unusual parameters or commands.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is running scripts that check for the existence of specific files. For example, the command line includes Test-Path with paths like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...\" and exits with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. These paths seem to be custom directories, which might be part of a malicious payload checking for certain files. But why would that be suspicious? Well, if an attacker is trying to determine if a certain file exists, maybe they're looking for a specific configuration or trying to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is the 'Registry value set' event with 'cmd.exe'. While cmd.exe is a standard tool, changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system settings. However, there's only one instance here, so maybe not enough to be concerning on its own.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, pointing to .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't inherently suspicious. However, if these are being loaded in an unusual context or from unexpected locations, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the paths are standard Windows directories, so that's probably normal.\n\nNow, looking at the 'Provider Lifecycle' events. The command lines here are similar to the ones before, with Test-Path checks for various .cs files. The paths are different each time, but they all follow a pattern of checking for specific source files. This repetition might indicate that the attacker is trying to check for the presence of certain files across different directories, possibly to determine if their payload has been deployed or if certain conditions are met.\n\nPutting this all together: the majority of the events are related to PowerShell and checking for the existence of specific files. While checking for files isn't inherently malicious, the frequency and the specific paths could be part of a larger attack. The use of PowerShell for these checks, combined with the multiple instances, might suggest that this is part of a script or malware that's probing the system. However, without seeing the actual content of the files or more context, like unusual network activity or privilege escalation, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the combination of repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific files in non-standard directories does raise a flag. This could be a sign of an initial compromise or reconnaissance phase. Therefore, it's worth further investigation to determine if these checks are part of legitimate software or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation due to potential security implications. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **High Volume of `powershell.exe` Events:** Multiple entries show `Process accessed` and `Process Create` events for `powershell.exe`. While PowerShell is a legitimate administrative tool, its frequent use in this context could indicate automated scripting or reconnaissance.\n   - **Custom File Path Checks:** PowerShell commands repeatedly use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of specific `.cs` files (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...`, `C:\\modulo_secundario\\...`). These paths are non-standard and may indicate probing for files associated with malicious payloads or infrastructure.\n\n2. **Suspicious Command-Line Patterns:**\n   - **Repetitive Scripting:** The `Provider Lifecycle` events show PowerShell scripts that check for the existence of `.cs` files across various directories (e.g., `C:\\tarefa_logico\\...`, `C:\\unidade_base\\...`). This repetition could suggest an attempt to determine if certain files (potentially malicious or configuration-related) exist on the system.\n   - **Exit Codes:** The scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on the presence of files, which may be part of conditional logic (e.g., checking for prerequisites before executing further actions).\n\n3. **Registry Activity:**\n   - A single `cmd.exe` event with a `Registry value set` action is logged. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate attempts to modify system settings for persistence or evasion.\n\n4. **Legitimate DLL Loads:**\n   - `Image loaded` events for `.NET` framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are logged. These are standard system components, so their presence alone is not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Security Concerns:**\n- **Reconnaissance Behavior:** The repeated checks for specific `.cs` files may indicate an attacker probing the system for the presence of files associated with a larger attack (e.g., checking for a staged payload or configuration files).\n- **Leveraging PowerShell for Stealth:** The use of PowerShell for file checks and scripting could be part of a tactic to avoid detection (e.g., using native tools instead of more obvious malicious binaries).\n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional logs (e.g., network activity, user context, or file content), it is challenging to confirm whether these actions are benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains) or **file modifications** related to the `.cs` files mentioned.\n   - Investigate **user context** (e.g., was this executed under a privileged account?).\n\n2. **Analyze File Content:**\n   - If the `.cs` files referenced exist, examine their contents for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, payloads, or C2 communication).\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Implement logging and alerts for unusual PowerShell commands (e.g., `Test-Path`, `Invoke-WebRequest`, or `Start-Process` with suspicious arguments).\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**\n   - Investigate the `Registry value set` event for signs of persistence (e.g., registry keys added to `Run` or `RunOnce`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **potentially suspicious behavior** consistent with **reconnaissance or initial compromise** phases of an attack. While no direct evidence of malicious activity is present, the repetitive PowerShell checks for non-standard files and the lack of contextual information justify **further investigation**. This could be a false positive (e.g., a legitimate script), but it warrants closer scrutiny to rule out adversarial activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell. The first event mentions the loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1, and then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script in Temp might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do that to execute malicious code temporarily. However, just creating and deleting a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently malicious, but if combined with other events, it might be a red flag. Then there are several PowerShell processes running with command lines that check if certain files exist. The paths mentioned are all over the place, like C:\\estrutura_temporario, C:\\tarefa_padrao, etc. These paths don't look standard, and the filenames like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" stand out. Keystroke logging is a common malicious activity, so that's a red flag.\n\nMultiple events have the same command line structure: checking if a specific PowerShell script exists and exiting with 0 or 1. The fact that these scripts are being checked in various paths might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a keystroke logging script, which is used to capture user input. This could be part of a larger attack, like stealing credentials or sensitive information.\n\nAlso, there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be related to PowerShell modules or scripts that are being initialized, but combined with the other events, especially the ones involving Get-Keystrokes.ps1, it's concerning. The repeated attempts to check for the existence of these scripts in different directories could be an indicator of a script that's trying to find a way to execute malicious code.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes accessing the registry and processes might be normal, but when combined with the other suspicious activities, it's more likely to be malicious. The fact that the same script name is used in multiple locations suggests that the attacker is trying to execute it from different places, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nI should also check if there are any legitimate reasons for these activities. For example, some scripts might be part of normal software operations. However, \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" is a very specific name that's commonly associated with malware. The use of Temp directories for creating and deleting scripts is a common tactic used by attackers to execute code without leaving persistent traces.\n\nIn summary, the key suspicious points are the repeated attempts to locate and execute \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" scripts, the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, and the multiple PowerShell processes accessing system resources. These activities collectively indicate potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repeated Checks for \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\":**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like:\n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **\"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\"** is a **strong indicator of keystroke logging malware**, commonly used to steal sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credentials).\n\n2. **Non-Standard Paths:**\n   - The scripts are checked in irregular, non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_temporario`, `C:\\registro_secundario`). This suggests **obfuscation or evasion tactics** to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1`) is created and deleted in the Temp directory. This is a **common technique** used by malware to execute payloads without leaving persistent traces.\n\n4. **High Volume of PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Over 20 PowerShell-related events, including **registry modifications**, **process access**, and **pipe creation**. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, such high-frequency activity with no clear purpose raises suspicion.\n\n5. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Context:**\n   - No evidence of legitimate software or administrative tasks justifying these actions. The use of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` and irregular paths strongly implies **malicious intent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity **strongly suggests a potential security threat**, such as **malware execution** or **credential harvesting**. Further investigation is required, including:\n- Analyzing the contents of the temporary script (if recoverable).\n- Checking for network exfiltration of keystroke data.\n- Reviewing system logs for unauthorized access or lateral movement.\n\n**Recommendation:** Isolate the affected system, perform a full malware scan, and monitor for data exfiltration."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through all the events to spot any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the tasks associated with PowerShell. There are several ImageLoad events, which are normal because PowerShell loads various DLLs when running scripts. However, I notice some entries like the loading of mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET. That's part of normal operations, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event where a temporary PowerShell script is created and then immediately deleted. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting files quickly might be part of an attack to avoid leaving traces. But the script's name seems generic, like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\". Maybe it's part of a legitimate test, but the fact that it's created and deleted so quickly might be worth looking into.\n\nAnother thing is the command lines for PowerShell. There are checks for the existence of \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" in different paths. The names \"componente_padrao\" and \"elemento_logico\" look like they could be obfuscated or part of a malicious script. However, the commands themselves are just testing if the file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a legitimate script, but combined with other activities, it could be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a PipeCreated event, which isn't inherently bad, but in combination with other events might indicate something. The presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded could be normal, but sometimes malware tries to bypass or interact with antivirus components.\n\nOther processes like whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe are mentioned. These are common system processes, and their activities like registry changes or image loads don't seem immediately suspicious. However, svchost.exe having registry value set events might be normal, but I should check if there's any unusual activity there.\n\nThe key points here are the PowerShell activities, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the checking for specific scripts. If these scripts are part of a legitimate process, like testing or automation, then it might be NOT interesting. But if the scripts are part of an attack, like keystroke logging or data exfiltration, then it's a concern.\n\nHowever, without more context, like the content of the scripts or network activity, it's hard to be certain. The logs don't show any direct malicious activity, but the patterns could indicate a potential compromise. The user might need to investigate further, looking into the scripts' contents, user context, and any other related logs. So, I think this is interesting enough for further investigation but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate **normal system and user activities** with **no clear evidence of malicious behavior**. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**:\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess`, `ImageLoad`, and `RegistryEvent` entries for `powershell.exe` are consistent with typical administrative or scripting tasks.\n   - The temporary file `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` and the script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` are likely part of **legitimate PowerShell profile configuration or testing** (e.g., testing script existence via `whoami.exe` or `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` checks).\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - The script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` is created and deleted immediately. While this could be a red flag in some contexts, **no malicious payload or suspicious commands** are visible in the logs.\n\n3. **Other Processes**:\n   - `whoami.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are standard system tools. Their activities (e.g., registry changes, image loads) are **normal** and unrelated to threats.\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file is part of **log configuration updates**, which is expected in monitoring setups.\n\n4. **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - No unusual network activity, unexpected binaries, or lateral movement is observed.\n   - The use of `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is **consistent with PowerShell's normal operation**.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe logs do **not** indicate a security threat. The activities align with **routine system administration, user testing, or log configuration updates**. However, if the environment has **no prior context** for the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` checks or the temporary script, further investigation (e.g., inspecting script content, user context, or network traffic) could be warranted as a precaution.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not Interesting for Investigation** (no actionable threats detected)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So the user wants me to analyze all the events together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of Elastic's Winlogbeat, which is used for log collection. Creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration setup, but maybe it's normal. Not sure yet, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's a bunch of powershell.exe events. Process accessed and process create events. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a normal tool. The command line for one of them is \"whoami.exe\", which is just getting user info. That's normal. But there's another PowerShell process with a command line that's doing \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". That's just listing files recursively. Maybe a red flag if it's part of a larger malicious activity, but alone it's not too bad.\n\nThen there's a lot of network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making network connections is normal, as it's a browser. Svchost.exe is a Windows process that hosts services, so it's common for it to have network activity. The DNS queries from Chrome are also normal. So maybe that's just regular browsing.\n\nBut then there's the PowerShell events where images are loaded. The files loaded are .dlls from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. For example, mscoree.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files. Loading them is normal during PowerShell execution, especially if it's using .NET. But the fact that multiple images are loaded might be part of a script running. However, since these are standard DLLs, I don't see an immediate issue here.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the first event is winlogbeat creating a file. Maybe that's part of a setup, but if there's no other malicious activity, it's just normal. The rest of the events are either normal system processes or expected PowerShell commands. There's no indication of data exfiltration, unusual network connections to suspicious IPs, or any other signs of compromise. The registry events are just value sets, which could be normal configuration changes.\n\nHmm, but maybe the combination of PowerShell being used to list files recursively and loading those DLLs could be part of something. However, without more context, like unexpected network destinations or unusual commands, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes and image loads might be normal if someone is running a script. But since there's no obvious malicious activity, maybe this isn't interesting.\n\nSo, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear signs of malicious behavior. The activities are either normal system operations or legitimate use of tools. The PowerShell commands are typical, and the loaded DLLs are legitimate. No suspicious network traffic or unexpected file modifications are present.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not exhibit clear indicators of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat File Creation**: The creation of a `.yml.new` file by `winlogbeat.exe` is consistent with normal configuration updates or initialization processes for log collection tools. No suspicious file paths or anomalous behavior are noted.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**: \n   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `get-childitem -recurse` are benign and commonly used for system diagnostics or scripting.\n   - The loading of legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) is expected during PowerShell execution, especially when interacting with .NET or Windows Defender components.\n\n3. **Network Traffic**: \n   - Network connections from `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` align with normal browser activity and system service operations.\n   - DNS queries from Chrome are typical for web browsing.\n\n4. **Registry Events**: The absence of suspicious registry modifications or unusual key\/value changes suggests no active configuration tampering.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events reflect routine system operations, legitimate tool usage, and standard process behavior. No actionable threats or anomalies are detected. \n\n**Classification**: **NOT INTERESTING**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each line.\n\nFirst, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a script quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The next event is a pipe created, which could be used for inter-process communication, maybe for stealthy communication.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse'. These commands are searching recursively, which might be part of information gathering. However, the same command repeated multiple times could indicate automated scanning or probing the file system for sensitive data.\n\nAnother event shows the loading of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe just normal operation. Then there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file is a .yml.new, which might be a configuration file being written, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother file created in the Downloads folder named 'estrutura_secundario.txt'—could be benign, but without more context, it's hard to tell. There are also registry value set events, which could be part of configuration changes, but again, not obviously malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the initial create and delete of a PowerShell script in Temp is a red flag. The repeated recursive commands might be probing the system. However, other events like the legitimate Defender DLL and Winlogbeat files are normal. The presence of multiple PowerShell activities, especially the script creation and deletion, suggests possible malicious behavior. But since there's no direct evidence of exploitation or data exfiltration, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence is moderate because while some events are suspicious, others are benign. So I'd classify this as interesting but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including script creation\/deletion in temp directory, recursive file system enumeration, and potential registry modifications raise suspicion of lateral movement or data collection. However, no direct malicious payload or exfiltration observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
