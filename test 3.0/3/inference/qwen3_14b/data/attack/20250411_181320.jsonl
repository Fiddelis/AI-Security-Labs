{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not suspicious. But then there's powershell.exe appearing multiple times. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used in certain ways, like executing commands or accessing the registry, it can be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events: there's a process accessed event, then a ProcessCreate with a command line that includes \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". That seems like it's trying to list files recursively, which might be part of a script. Then there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll could be a sign that something is trying to bypass security software.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a script file in the Temp directory is suspicious because it could indicate that a malicious script was executed and then cleaned up to avoid detection. The command line in the ProcessCreate event shows a PowerShell command that's recursively listing files, which might be part of a larger script that's searching for something or preparing to execute other commands.\n\nAlso, the repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events might indicate that the PowerShell process is interacting with the system in a way that's not typical. The Pipe Created event could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad but might be part of a more complex attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell executing recursive file listings, loading multiple DLLs, creating and deleting a temporary script file, and the number of events related to PowerShell might indicate an attempt to perform some malicious activity, like data exfiltration or executing a payload. However, since the commands are somewhat common (like ls and get-childitem), it's possible that this is just a legitimate script. But the fact that the script is being created and deleted, along with the multiple registry and image load events, increases the suspicion. However, without more context, like the actual content of the script or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. But overall, the frequency and types of events involving PowerShell do make this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially suspicious activity** warranting further investigation, though not definitively malicious. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Activity:**\n   - **Recurring `ls -recurse`\/`get-childitem -recurse` commands** in the command line suggest recursive file\/dir enumeration, which could be part of a script probing the file system for sensitive data or preparing for exploitation.\n   - **File creation and deletion** (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` in `Temp` directory) implies a script was executed and then deleted, a common tactic to avoid detection.\n\n2. **Unusual DLL Loading:**\n   - **Multiple `.NET` and `Windows Defender` DLLs** (`System.Windows.Forms`, `MpOAV.dll`) are loaded. While `.NET` is common for PowerShell scripts, `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender) being loaded in this context could indicate an attempt to interact with or bypass security software.\n\n3. **High Volume of PowerShell Events:**\n   - **10+ PowerShell-related events** (ProcessCreate, FileCreate\/Delete, ImageLoad, Provider\/Engine Lifecycle) suggest persistent or automated activity, which is unusual for typical user behavior.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Context:**\n   - No clear justification for the script's purpose (e.g., no user-initiated task or documented automation) is evident in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious Elements:**\n- **Chrome.exe activity** (DNS queries, network connections) is normal for a browser.\n- **Windows Defender DLL** (`MpOAV.dll`) could be part of legitimate security operations, though its presence here is context-dependent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch warrants **further investigation** due to the combination of:\n- **PowerShell scripting with file enumeration and cleanup** (common in malicious payloads).\n- **Unusual DLL loading** and high volume of events.\n- **Absence of clear benign context** for the activity.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Check the **content of the deleted script** (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) if possible (e.g., via forensics tools).\n- Correlate with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine the script's purpose.\n- Monitor for **follow-on actions** (e.g., data exfiltration, privilege escalation).\n\n**Verdict:** **Likely benign but suspiciousâ€”investigate further.**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\... MpClient.dll. That's a legitimate file, part of Windows Defender. So that might be normal. But I should check if there's any unusual activity around it.\n\nNext, there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal during setup. However, the same file is mentioned multiple times. Maybe that's just part of the installation process.\n\nThen, there's a powershell.exe command with ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. That's just listing files recursively, which isn't inherently malicious. But if done in a sensitive directory, it could be a red flag. However, the log doesn't specify the path, so I can't tell for sure.\n\nLooking further, there are several File created events for powershell.exe, like creating objeto_principal.txt. That's a generic filename, but creating files in user directories might be normal. However, if there's a pattern of creating many files or in unusual locations, that's a concern.\n\nRegistry value set events for powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate software updates, but if done by malicious software, it could be a sign of persistence or configuration changes. The logs don't specify which registry keys are modified, so it's hard to say without more context.\n\nThere are multiple entries for svchost.exe and services.exe related to logon and user account management. These could be part of normal system operations, but repeated entries might indicate something's wrong. However, svchost.exe is a common host process, so it's hard to tell without more info.\n\nThe User Account Management events with process None might be related to system-level changes, but again, without knowing the exact actions, it's hard to assess. These could be part of normal user account management or something more malicious.\n\nThe repetition of the same file creation event for winlogbeat.exe multiple times might indicate that the process is being repeated or there's a loop. But again, if it's part of a setup or configuration, it might be normal.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of normal system activities and some events that could be benign or suspicious. The lack of specific details like registry keys, file contents, or user context makes it hard to confirm malicious intent. However, the presence of multiple file creations, registry changes, and process accesses might warrant further investigation, especially if these events are occurring in a context where they shouldn't. But based solely on the logs provided, without more context, it's not definitively malicious. So, maybe the answer is that it's not clearly malicious but could be worth looking into for more details.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior**, but there is **no definitive evidence of malicious activity** based solely on the information available. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Normal or Benign Activity**\n- **Windows Defender (MpClient.dll)**: The first log entry involves `powershell.exe` interacting with a legitimate Windows Defender file (`MpClient.dll`). This is a standard component of Windows Defender and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: The repeated creation of `.yml.new` files in the `Downloads` directory by `winlogbeat.exe` is consistent with **log shipper configuration** (e.g., during setup or updates). This is expected behavior for tools like Winlogbeat.\n- **Standard Commands**: The use of `ls -recurse` or `get-childitem -recurse` in PowerShell is a common administrative task and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Behavior**\n- **Repetitive File Creation**: The same `.yml.new` file is logged multiple times by `winlogbeat.exe`. While this could be part of a normal process, it might also indicate **redundant operations** or **unusual behavior** if the file is being repeatedly modified or overwritten.\n- **Registry Modifications**: Multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other processes modifying registry values (e.g., `Registry value set`) could indicate **configuration changes** or **persistence mechanisms**. However, without context (e.g., specific registry keys or values modified), these cannot be confirmed as malicious.\n- **User Account Management Events**: The repeated `User Account Management` logs (with `process: None`) may indicate **system-level user account changes**, but they lack specificity. These could be legitimate (e.g., user profile updates) or part of **credential manipulation** if tied to other suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Missing Context for Determination**\n- **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: There are no clear IoCs such as unexpected network connections, unauthorized binaries, or anomalous process trees.\n- **Lack of File Paths\/Contents**: Critical details (e.g., specific registry keys, file contents, or user context) are not provided, making it difficult to assess whether the activity is benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Not Clearly Malicious**: The logs do not contain overt signs of malware, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n- **Warrants Further Investigation**: The repetitive file creation, registry modifications, and user account events could be **normal** in some contexts (e.g., software updates, log configuration) but merit deeper analysis (e.g., correlating with other logs, checking file hashes, inspecting registry changes).\n\n**Recommendation**: If this is part of a larger security investigation, focus on:\n- Cross-referencing these logs with **network traffic** or **process tree data**.\n- Checking the **integrity of the `.yml.new` file** (e.g., hash verification).\n- Investigating **user account changes** for unauthorized modifications (e.g., new accounts, password resets)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a batch of events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the first batch, there are several entries involving powershell.exe. One event mentions the file 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe not suspicious. Then there's a lot of file creation events with powershell.exe, like creating 'objeto_principal.txt' and some .yml.new files. The .yml.new files might be related to configuration files, but creating them isn't necessarily bad. However, there are multiple registry value set events, which could indicate changes to the system configuration. Also, the 'winlogbeat.exe' process is creating files in the Downloads directory, which might be normal if it's part of a setup. But the repetition of events, especially the registry changes, might be worth checking for anomalies.\n\nIn the second batch, there's 'calc.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll', which is a standard DLL for Internet Explorer. The Calculator.exe entry is similar, but the name is capitalized differently. However, 'urlmon.dll' is a legitimate system file. The svchost.exe entries are common for Windows services, and registry changes here might be part of normal operations. However, the presence of multiple registry events and the mix of processes might not be immediately suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the first batch has more activity that could be considered unusual, like multiple file creations and registry changes. The second batch seems more routine. But I need to check if any of the files or processes are associated with malicious activities. The 'MpClient.dll' is from Windows Defender, so that's safe. The 'winlogbeat.exe' is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so creating .yml files might be part of its configuration. The registry changes could be part of normal operations, but if they're excessive or unexpected, that's a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The second batch doesn't have any obvious red flags. \n\nOverall, the first batch has more events that might warrant further investigation, but none are definitively malicious. The answer should indicate that while some activities are normal, the combination of file creations and registry changes could be worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of interest, but **no definitive malicious activity is evident**. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate System Activity**:\n   - **`MpClient.dll`** (from Windows Defender) being loaded by `powershell.exe` is expected and benign.\n   - **`urlmon.dll`** (a standard Windows DLL for URL handling) being loaded by `calc.exe` and `Calculator.exe` is routine.\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`services.exe`** are core Windows processes, and their registry interactions are typical for service management.\n\n2. **Potential Anomalies**:\n   - **Repetitive Registry Changes**: Multiple entries involving **`Registry value set`** events (e.g., by `svchost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`) could indicate **unusual configuration changes**. While not inherently malicious, this warrants further scrutiny to confirm if these changes are part of legitimate system updates or user activity.\n   - **File Creation by `powershell.exe`**: The creation of files like `objeto_principal.txt` and `.yml.new` files in the `Downloads` directory may be benign (e.g., user-generated files or tool configurations), but **unauthorized script execution** or **suspicious file paths** could be red flags if context is missing.\n\n3. **`winlogbeat.exe` Activity**:\n   - The repeated creation of `.yml.new` files by `winlogbeat.exe` (a log-shipping tool) may indicate **normal configuration updates**. However, if this is unexpected or occurs in unusual locations, it could signal **misconfigured tools** or **unauthorized access**.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile the logs do not contain clear evidence of malicious activity, the **repetitive registry changes** and **unusual file creation** by `powershell.exe` merit further investigation. Ensure:\n- **Contextual checks** (e.g., user intent, file content, and process behavior).\n- **Correlation with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user activity).\n- **Validation** of `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` actions against known baselines.\n\n**No immediate action required**, but **monitoring and deeper analysis** are recommended for these events."}
