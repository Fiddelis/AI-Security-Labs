{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not too worrying. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines.\n\nOne of the entries has a PowerShell command that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' in various file types. The command is looking for passwords in files like .xml, .doc, .txt, .xls. That's a bit suspicious because it's searching for sensitive information. But wait, the same command appears multiple times, and some of the winlog tasks are 'Provider Lifecycle', which might be related to event logging rather than actual execution. However, the presence of this command multiple times could indicate an attempt to search for credentials.\n\nLooking further, there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, which includes .dll files from the .NET framework. Those are legitimate, but the repetition might be a red flag. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to hide its tracks. The file is a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it quickly could be part of an attack.\n\nAnother point is the 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if there's no context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nThere's also a 'File created' event for a .yml.new file related to Winlogbeat. That's a log shipper, so maybe someone is trying to configure or tamper with it. But not sure if that's malicious here.\n\nThe user 'fiddelis' is mentioned in the file paths. If that's a legitimate user, maybe not, but if it's a compromised account, then the activities could be malicious. However, without more context on the user, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple process accesses and image loads might indicate a malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to search for sensitive information could be part of a credential harvesting attempt. The fact that the same command is logged multiple times under different tasks might be an indicator of something automated or malicious.\n\nHowever, some of the events could be normal. For example, PowerShell is often used in legitimate scripts. The presence of the 'Provider Lifecycle' task might be part of the logging system, not the actual execution. But the combination of these events, especially the file creation\/deletion and the password search, raises suspicion.\n\nI think this batch is interesting enough for further investigation. The red flags are the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, the temporary file handling, and the multiple process-related events. Even though some could be benign, the pattern suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Command for Credential Harvesting**\n- **Command Example**:  \n  ```powershell\n  findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls | select-string -Pattern password\n  ```\n- **Suspicious Behavior**:  \n  - This command searches for files containing the word \"pass\" (likely passwords) across multiple file types (e.g., `.txt`, `.xls`).  \n  - The repetition of this command **12 times** in the logs suggests **automation or persistence** (e.g., a script scanning for credentials).  \n  - This could indicate **credential harvesting** or **data exfiltration** attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temporary File Creation and Deletion**\n- **Event**:  \n  - A PowerShell script (`*.ps1`) is **created** in the `Temp` directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...`) and **immediately deleted**.  \n- **Suspicious Behavior**:  \n  - This is a **common tactic** for malware to execute malicious code in memory (e.g., via PowerShell) without leaving persistent files.  \n  - The use of a `.ps1` script (PowerShell script) raises concerns about **remote code execution** or **payload delivery**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**\n- **Observations**:  \n  - Multiple entries for `powershell.exe` with **similar command lines** and **repeated log entries** (e.g., \"Provider Lifecycle\" task).  \n  - **16+ instances** of PowerShell-related events in the logs.  \n- **Suspicious Behavior**:  \n  - While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its **high-frequency use** in this context may indicate **script-based attacks** (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration).  \n  - The repetition of the same command under different log tasks (e.g., \"Provider Lifecycle\") may suggest **log tampering** or **event injection**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Unusual File and Process Activity**\n- **Other Notable Events**:  \n  - **`notepad.exe`** and **`calc.exe`** with `Registry value set` events. While these processes are legitimate, their association with registry modifications may indicate **malicious configuration changes**.  \n  - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a `.yml.new` file (a configuration file for the log shipper). This could signal **tampering with logging tools** to obscure malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Lack of Contextual Clues**\n- **Unclear User Context**:  \n  - The user **`fiddelis`** is involved in the file paths, but there is no information about whether this is a **legitimate user** or a **compromised account**.  \n  - The absence of **authentication logs**, **user behavior analytics**, or **network traffic data** limits the ability to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs contain **multiple red flags** consistent with **malicious activity**, including:  \n- **Credential harvesting** via PowerShell.  \n- **In-memory execution** of malicious scripts (via temporary file creation\/deletion).  \n- **Unusual process and file activity** that may indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **data exfiltration**.  \n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- **Investigate further** by correlating these logs with:  \n  - **User behavior analytics** (e.g., is `fiddelis` a legitimate user?).  \n  - **Network traffic** (e.g., did the system communicate with external IPs?).  \n  - **Memory dumps** (e.g., check for PowerShell-based malware in memory).  \n- **Block or monitor** PowerShell execution if the system is not a server (as per Microsoft's security best practices).  \n\nThis batch of logs is **highly suspicious** and merits immediate attention."}

That path seems legitimate, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a command line in another entry using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in various files. That's a common technique for password spraying or data exfiltration. \n\nNext, multiple entries show svchost.exe and other processes setting registry values. That's normal for some system operations, but if it's excessive, it might be a red flag. However, there's no immediate indication of harm here.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal, as that's part of Internet Explorer. But then there's a Chrome.exe doing a bunch of registry modifications and DNS queries. A lot of registry changes could be part of a malware's persistence mechanism. Also, multiple DNS queries might indicate communication with C2 servers.\n\nThe powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory could be benign, like a temporary file, but sometimes attackers use AppData for storing malicious scripts. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file might be part of a legitimate configuration update, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of tampering. However, the presence of winlogbeat suggests that log collection is happening, which is normal in monitored environments.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious part is the PowerShell command searching for passwords. That's a classic sign of an attacker trying to find credentials. Combined with the multiple registry changes and DNS queries from Chrome, it might indicate some malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe has an image loaded from a Windows Defender DLL. That seems normal, maybe part of the browser's interaction with the antivirus. But then there are multiple entries of chrome.exe making network connections. A lot of NetworkConnect events might be normal if the browser is accessing the internet, but maybe if they're going to suspicious domains or there's a pattern, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't mention the destination IPs or domains, so I can't tell yet.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. The filename is \"objeto_logico.txt\". Creating files in Downloads isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe. There's another file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, so that might be normal if they're setting up monitoring. However, the same file is mentioned twice, which might be a mistake or a repeated action.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign as it just returns the user's identity. But then there's a cmd.exe process running schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks could be part of cleaning up after a malware installation, or maybe legitimate if they're removing old tasks. The command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and similar. Without knowing what those tasks were, it's hard to say, but deleting scheduled tasks can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being executed to delete another task, and an image loaded from taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler service. That's normal, but combined with the deletion of tasks, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nAlso, multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe could indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which might not be normal. The presence of multiple RegistryEvent entries, especially from svchost.exe, might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms if done by malware.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of network activity, file creations, deletion of scheduled tasks, and registry changes might indicate that something is happening here. However, some of these actions could be legitimate. For example, setting up monitoring tools like winlogbeat, or cleaning up old tasks. But the repeated actions and the use of PowerShell, which is often used in scripts for both legitimate and malicious purposes, could be a concern. The lack of context on the network destinations and the specific tasks being deleted makes it harder to determine, but the presence of multiple suspicious activities in a short time frame might warrant further investigation. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations and Concerns:**\n1. **Unusual Network Activity:**\n   - **Chrome.exe** has multiple `NetworkConnect` events. While browsers typically access the internet, the lack of destination details (IPs\/domains) makes it hard to assess risk. However, **frequent or unusual connections** could indicate data exfiltration or communication with malicious servers.\n\n2. **File Creation and Modifications:**\n   - **PowerShell.exe** and **Winlogbeat.exe** created files in the `Downloads` directory (e.g., `estrutura_ativo.txt`, `.winlogbeat.yml.new`). While benign in isolation, **repeated file creation** by PowerShell could indicate script-based activities (e.g., log collection, data manipulation).\n   - **Whoami.exe** execution is normal but may be used to **identify the current user** for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\n3. **Scheduled Task Manipulation:**\n   - **Cmd.exe** and **Schtasks.exe** executed commands to **delete scheduled tasks** (e.g., `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`). This could be part of **cleaning up malicious tasks** or legitimate system maintenance. However, **deleting tasks without clear justification** may indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Activity:**\n   - **Svchost.exe** and **PowerShell.exe** triggered `RegistryEvent` entries (e.g., `Registry object added or deleted`). Registry modifications are common in **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries, modifying system policies).\n   - **ProcessAccess** events for PowerShell suggest **monitoring or manipulation** of the process, which could be part of **malware evasion** or **remote control**.\n\n5. **Executable Execution:**\n   - **Schtasks.exe** loaded `taskschd.dll` (a legitimate Windows component), but the **deletion of tasks** combined with other activities raises suspicion of **scheduled task-based attacks** (e.g., executing payloads at specific times).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n- **Suspicious Processes:** \n  - `cmd.exe` running `schtasks \/delete` commands to remove tasks.\n  - `PowerShell.exe` with multiple `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` triggers.\n- **Anomalous Behavior:**\n  - Repeated file creation in `Downloads` by PowerShell.\n  - Deletion of scheduled tasks without clear context.\n- **Lack of Context:**\n  - No details on network destinations, task definitions, or registry modifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Data:**\n   - Check **network traffic logs** for connections from `chrome.exe` or other processes to identify potential C2 servers.\n   - Investigate **scheduled task definitions** (e.g., what were the deleted tasks doing?).\n   - Analyze **registry changes** for persistence mechanisms (e.g., startup entries, service modifications).\n\n2. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Scan the system for malware using tools like **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **SIEM-based threat intelligence**.\n   - Examine the contents of files like `estrutura_ativo.txt` or `objeto_ativo.txt` for sensitive data or malicious code.\n\n3. **Review User Activity:**\n   - Determine if **administrator privileges** were used during these activities.\n   - Check for **unauthorized user access** or lateral movement indicators.\n\n4. **Implement Monitoring:**\n   - Monitor **PowerShell usage** (e.g., via `AuditPolicy` in Windows) for suspicious scripts.\n   - Enable **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to track process behavior and registry changes in real time.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities (e.g., Winlogbeat file creation, Chrome network traffic) are benign, the **combination of task deletion, PowerShell activity, and registry modifications** suggests potential malicious behavior. This warrants **further investigation** to confirm whether the system has been compromised."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first event is about 'schtasks.exe' deleting a task named \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task could be part of a cleanup after an attack. But maybe it's a legitimate action? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's 'schtasks.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll', which is a normal system file. Then, 'svchost.exe' and 'cmd.exe' interacting with the registry. 'powershell.exe' being accessed multiple times. 'whoami.exe' running, which is usually used to check user context. Then, 'WMIC.exe' deleting notepad.exe processes. That might be odd because deleting processes isn't typical unless it's part of a malicious activity.\n\nWait, the 'cmd.exe' command line has 'wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete'. That's a red flag. Deleting processes via WMIC could be part of a malicious script trying to remove evidence. Also, the 'net user \/del' commands are deleting user accounts, which is a significant action and could indicate someone trying to remove access points or clean up after themselves.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' being used, along with registry modifications. The combination of deleting scheduled tasks, deleting processes, and modifying user accounts suggests someone is trying to manipulate the system. The use of 'WMIC' and 'net' commands to delete processes and users is not typical in normal operations. \n\nAlso, the fact that 'schtasks.exe' is deleting a task might be part of a larger attack where the attacker is removing their own scheduled tasks to avoid detection. The repeated use of 'powershell.exe' could be for executing scripts, which is common in attacks. \n\nHowever, I need to make sure this isn't just a normal system cleanup. But the combination of these actions—deleting tasks, processes, users, and registry changes—seems too coordinated to be benign. The confidence here would be high because these actions are indicative of malicious behavior, even if there's no direct evidence like malware hashes or network connections. The justification would be the suspicious command lines and the pattern of events that suggest system manipulation and cleanup.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled tasks (schtasks.exe), process deletion via WMIC, user account deletions (net user \/del), and frequent PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage with registry modifications. These actions align with post-exploitation cleanup and privilege escalation patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe. Some of these are common utilities, but others like sc.exe and net.exe can be used for malicious purposes. \n\nNow, checking the commands. There's a line where cmd.exe is used with \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin \/del \/domain\". Deleting a user in a domain might be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger pattern. Then there's another command: \"sc delete win32times\". Deleting a service named win32times could be an attempt to remove a legitimate service, which is a red flag. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of Registry value set events. While changing registry values isn't always bad, if done in quick succession or by unexpected processes, it could indicate tampering. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with process access and create events might suggest someone is trying to execute commands or modify system settings.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to User Account Management and Security Group Management. If these are part of normal administrative tasks, they might be okay, but if they're being done in a way that's unusual or without proper authorization, that's a problem. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be part of routine maintenance. For example, deleting a service or modifying user accounts might be legitimate. But the combination of multiple suspicious commands, along with registry changes and the use of tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe, raises concerns. \n\nThe confidence here isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malware, but the pattern of activities does point towards potential malicious behavior.

That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's deleting files in the Temp directory. The command line shows it's deleting some temporary files. That could be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers use Temp folders to store malicious files before deleting them. Hmm, but the command line is pretty straightforward here, just deleting files. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are several entries of powershell.exe being accessed, which is normal. Then another cmd.exe deleting a file named 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe' from the Temp directory. The name 'calc_decoded' might be a red flag. 'calc' is often associated with the Calculator application, but here it's part of a filename that might be related to malicious activity, like a decoded payload. Deleting this file could be part of an attack to remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some .NET and Windows Defender related ones. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might indicate some unusual process behavior, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, there's a file created and then immediately deleted: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1'. PowerShell scripts are often used in attacks, and creating then deleting a script could be an attempt to execute it without leaving traces. The name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which might be a legitimate test, but combined with the deletion, it's a bit suspicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that multiple registry values are being set by different processes (cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe) might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the deletion of files in Temp, the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script, and the use of PowerShell which is a common vector for attacks.

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That's a common tool, but it's also often used in attacks. Let me check the tasks. There's a 'Pipe Created' event, which might be normal, but then there's 'Image loaded' pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Wait, that's a legitimate file, so maybe that's okay. But then there's a 'File created' event in the user's AppData folder. That could be suspicious because creating files in startup locations might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are several 'Registry value set' events. Registry changes can be part of configuration changes, but if they're unexpected, that's a red flag. However, the logs don't show the specific registry keys, so it's hard to tell. Also, there are multiple 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe. That might indicate someone is trying to manipulate or monitor the process.\n\nLooking further, there are entries for whoami.exe being created multiple times. That's a normal command to check user context, but if it's being called repeatedly, maybe that's part of a script or attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, there's a 'File created' event for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be legitimate if someone is setting up monitoring, but could also be a red herring.\n\nOther entries include notepad.exe and calc.exe with image loaded events. Those are standard processes, but the paths mentioned are legitimate system files. There's also RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe with registry changes. These are common system processes, so their activity might be normal unless there's a pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the creation of files in AppData, multiple registry changes, and frequent process accesses on powershell.exe. However, some of these could be benign. The presence of Windows Defender's MpClient.dll is normal. The whoami.exe calls might be part of a script. Without more context on the registry changes or the purpose of the files created, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of these events might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or manipulate the system.

PowerShell is common, but accessing it multiple times might be suspicious if it's part of a script or automation. \n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so probably benign. Then ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying registry values. Those are typical Windows processes, so maybe just normal operations. Chrome.exe has several DNS queries and network connections. That's expected for a browser, especially if it's loading multiple pages or connecting to various services.\n\nLooking at the whole batch, most activities are standard for a user interacting with their system. The winlogbeat file creation is likely part of a legitimate setup. The PowerShell accesses don't have any obvious malicious indicators here. No unusual processes or unexpected file paths.
