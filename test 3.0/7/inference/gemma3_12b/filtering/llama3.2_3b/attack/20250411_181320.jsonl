The repeated `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events associated with PowerShell also suggest potentially obfuscated or malicious scripts. The chrome.exe network connections are also potentially interesting in combination with the other activity. The seemingly unrelated user account management and logon events add noise but don's negate the significance of the PowerShell activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
