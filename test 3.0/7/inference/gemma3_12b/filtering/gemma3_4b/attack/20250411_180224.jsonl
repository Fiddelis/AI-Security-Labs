This behavior strongly suggests a potential attempt at persistence or malicious activity, even if the scripts themselves don's exist.  The repeated creation and querying of the 'win32times' task is also suspicious. While other processes are normal, the combination of scheduled task creation, PowerShell bypass, and suspicious script names warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
