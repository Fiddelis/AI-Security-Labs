The creation of a file named 'entrada_logico.txt' by PowerShell is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The repeated creation of the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file may indicate a misconfiguration or attempted modification of the winlogbeat agent. Several DLLs are being loaded by tasklist.exe which is common but needs context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
