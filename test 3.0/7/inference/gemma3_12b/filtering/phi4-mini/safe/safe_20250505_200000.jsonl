Additionally, we see multiple file creation events, including temporary files created by svchost.exe and activity related to winlogbeat and DrvInst.  The repetitive registry modifications and file creation, coupled with the presence of DrvInst.exe, which is often associated with driver installations, suggests a potential driver installation process or suspicious activity warranting further investigation.
