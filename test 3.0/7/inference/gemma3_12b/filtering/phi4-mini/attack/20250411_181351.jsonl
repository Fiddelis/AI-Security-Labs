This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential remote access or data exfiltration. The use of `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms` and saving screenshots demonstrates a clear attempt to capture screen contents. The repeated pattern with different filenames strengthens the concern.
