The lack of familiarity with 'SDXHelper.exe' raises interest but does not alone confirm malicious intent, hence the classification as \"interesting\" rather than \"suspicious.\" Confidence is set to medium due to these factors being somewhat indicative but not conclusively definitive without further context or analysis."}
