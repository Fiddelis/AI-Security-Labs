The presence of special logon tasks without associated processes may suggest unauthorized access attempts. Additionally, the loading of system libraries like urlmon.dll and combase.dll by potentially benign applications (WindowsCamera.exe and SDXHelper.exe) might be indicative of DLL hijacking. These combined factors warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
