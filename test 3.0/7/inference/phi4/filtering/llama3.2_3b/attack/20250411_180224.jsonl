The use of `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks running PowerShell scripts with bypass execution policies (`-ep bypass`) is a common technique for persistence in malware attacks, especially when the script paths do not exist (e.g., 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'). This behavior, combined with attempts to hide these actions through task creation and querying (`schtasks`), suggests an attempt to maintain control or execute malicious activities. Additionally, `svchost.exe` is typically used by legitimate services but is also a common choice for malware authors due to its trusted status.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
