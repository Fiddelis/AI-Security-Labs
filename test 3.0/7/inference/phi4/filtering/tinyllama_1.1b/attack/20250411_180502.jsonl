There are events indicating the use of PowerShell to start processes from dynamically generated paths using relative directory traversal, which is a common technique used in obfuscation and evasion tactics. Additionally, there are multiple instances of registry value sets, image load events for system DLLs, and file creation operations linked with PowerShell.
