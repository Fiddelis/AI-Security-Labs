{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe and unusual image loading events involving critical system files, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Registry Value Sets**: The repeated setting of registry values by `chrome.exe` could be benign (e.g., application settings) or malicious (e.g., persistence mechanisms). Multiple such entries without user interaction might warrant investigation.\n\n2. **Image Loading Events**:\n   - Loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` into `chrome.exe` is suspicious because these are anti-malware components typically used by security software, not a web browser like Chrome.\n   - These events could indicate attempts to disable or bypass antivirus protections.\n\n3. **Process Access**: A single event where `powershell.exe` accessed another process might be normal, but combined with the other anomalies, it raises suspicion of potentially malicious scripts being executed.\n\nGiven these observations, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation. The confidence level reflects a strong likelihood of potential issues based on typical indicators of compromise, though not absolute certainty without additional context."}
