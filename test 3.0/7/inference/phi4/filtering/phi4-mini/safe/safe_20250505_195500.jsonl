This tool is typically used for collecting Windows event logs, which suggests legitimate monitoring activity.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- The repeated creation of similar files by `SDXHelper.exe` could indicate automated script behavior. While this can be normal, it warrants attention to ensure that it's part of expected operations.\n- The use of unique hashes is a standard practice in software deployment and version control, supporting the notion of legitimate activity but also requiring monitoring to ensure no unauthorized or malicious modifications occur.\n- The creation of `.yml.new` by `winlogbeat.exe` suggests configuration updates or system monitoring activities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven these factors, while there are indicators of routine operations (especially with Microsoft Office and Winlogbeat), the repeated creation of files with identical names can be unusual. This behavior should be further investigated to rule out any anomalies or security risks. Hence, it is classified as \"INTERESTING\" due to its potential implications, but not necessarily malicious without further context. The confidence level is set at medium, acknowledging that while there are benign indicators, the repeated file creation could warrant additional scrutiny."}
