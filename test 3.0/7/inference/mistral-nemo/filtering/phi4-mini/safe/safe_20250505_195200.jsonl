In that case, you could try:\n  - Restarting the Office application(s)\n  - Repairing Office from Control Panel ( Programs -> Microsoft Office Tools -> Office ->\n    \"Runsetup.exe\" from the right-click context menu)\n  - Updating Office to the latest version\n  - Running a full system scan with your preferred antivirus\/anti-malware software"}

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Process Name:** `SDXHelper.exe` - This process is likely related to Microsoft Office, possibly associated with service pack or update installation.\n\n2. **Task:** The task performed by this process is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that the process is creating new files in the specified locations.\n\n3. **Locations:**\n   - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...` - These are typical locations for Office application data, such as caches, temporary files, or support files.\n   - `...\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\` - This suggests that the files being created are part of the offline files (OLE) feature in Microsoft Office.\n\n4. **File Names:** The filenames mentioned in the logs appear to be related to Excel co-authoring features and strings for Excel copilot, as they follow a pattern like `excel-copilot-strings_<hash>.js`. This indicates that the process is creating or updating JavaScript files containing resources for these features.\n\nHere's an example of what one of these logs might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"SDXHelper.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\",\n    \"file\": {\n      \"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\root\\\\Office16\\\\EXCEL\\\\16.0\\\\OFFICECOMM\\\\excel-copilot-strings_7cdab44477db685fb20d25c96f5e8eb3.js\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, these logs show that Microsoft Office is creating or updating JavaScript files related to Excel copilot strings and offline files.
