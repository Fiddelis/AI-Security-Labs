{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a summary of the activities:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update (msedgeupdate.exe) execution:**\n   - The process `msedgeupdate.exe` was created and started executing.\n   - It loaded several DLLs including `msedgeupdate.dll`.\n   - It accessed other processes and made network connections, possibly to check for updates or download them.\n   - The process terminated after completing its task.\n\n2. **Windows Update logs:**\n   - Two Windows Update event trace log files were created:\n     - `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.5.etl`\n     - `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.6.etl`\n\n3. **Winlogbeat execution:**\n   - The process `winlogbeat.exe` was created and started executing from the downloads folder.\n   - It loaded its executable and created a new NDJSON log file in its logs directory:\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`\n\n4. **PowerShell access:**\n   - The process `powershell.exe` accessed another process, which could indicate script execution or remote command invocation.\n\nThese events suggest that Microsoft Edge Update was running and completed its task, Windows Update logs were generated, Winlogbeat (Elastic's lightweight ship for logging) was started and created a new log file, and PowerShell was used to access another process on the system."}

However, without further context or threat intelligence indicators, it's challenging to determine if these activities are malicious. Always ensure your system is updated and protected against known threats."}
