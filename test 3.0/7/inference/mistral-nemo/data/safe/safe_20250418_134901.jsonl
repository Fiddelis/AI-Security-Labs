{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a summary of the events based on the logs you've shared:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Installation and Initialization:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` was started, and it tried to create and access `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files in its data directory.\n   - It logged several \"Image loaded\" events for various Windows System processes (e.g., `sppsvc.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `chrome.exe`, etc.).\n\n2. **Registry Events:**\n   - Multiple registry events were logged, primarily with tasks like \"Registry value set\", \"Registry object added or deleted\". Most of these are related to processes like `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`.\n\n3. **File Creation:**\n   - A temporary file was created by `setup.exe`: `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`.\n   - `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files were created and accessed by `winlogbeat.exe`.\n\n4. **Dns Query:**\n   - A \"Dns query\" event was logged for `chrome.exe`.\n\n5. **No Activity (for some events):**\n   - There are some events where the `process` field is null, indicating no active process, but a task like \"None\" is still logged.\n\n6. **Image Loaded Events:**\n   - Several processes loaded system DLLs such as `taskschd.dll`, `urlmon.dll`.\n\nThese logs suggest that winlogbeat was successfully started and began logging events from various Windows processes. However, there are numerous registry-related events, which might indicate some level of unusual activity or configuration changes on the system. To further investigate any potential security concerns or anomalies, you would need to analyze these events in more detail, possibly correlating them with other logged activities."}
