So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe are doing registry value sets. Those are common processes, so maybe normal. But then there's powershell.exe being accessed, which can be a red flag if it's doing something unusual. \n\nLooking further, there's an image loaded event for urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unexpected context, that could be bad. Then there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal, but creating a new config file might be something to check.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe command, which is just showing user info, so probably benign. But the cmd.exe process running a wmic command to delete notepad.exe processes. That's suspicious because deleting processes isn't typical. Also, the WMIC.exe process is being used here, which is often associated with malicious activities. \n\nThen, multiple image loads for urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so loading that might be normal, but if it's being done by a suspicious process, that's a problem.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's a lot of chrome.exe and powershell.exe, which are common, but also some cmd.exe, whoami.exe, schtasks.exe, and conhost.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. \n\nHmm, one entry stands out: the cmd.exe command line has \"copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That sounds like a possible attempt to replace the Sticky Keys executable with a backup file, which is a common tactic in attacks to replace system files with malicious ones. \n\nAnother thing is the use of schtasks.exe with the \/delete command. Deleting a scheduled task might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger attack. Also, there's the whoami.exe being executed multiple times, which could be for enumerating user privileges. \n\nThen there's the \"schtasks.exe\" entry where the file path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded in an unexpected context, it might be suspicious. However, the log shows it's part of a process create event, so maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nThe repeated Registry value set events might be normal for some applications, but when combined with other suspicious commands, they could indicate configuration changes. The presence of multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe might suggest that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, I should check if these are all legitimate activities. For example, chrome.exe modifying the registry could be part of its normal operation, like updating settings. Similarly, powershell.exe being used for process access might be part of scripts that are allowed. But the specific command lines, like the copy command replacing sethc.exe, are definitely suspicious. \n\nAlso, the fact that multiple events involve cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, which are often used in attack chains, adds to the concern. The combination of these activities might indicate an attacker trying to modify system files, delete scheduled tasks, and execute commands to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of the suspicious command line in cmd.exe, along with multiple registry changes and process accesses, suggests that this batch of events is interesting and warrants further investigation.

That's a common administrative task, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading that might be normal, but MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. However, sometimes attackers might use legitimate DLLs for malicious purposes. But I need more context.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe performing registry value sets and process accesses. The repeated registry changes could indicate someone trying to modify system settings, maybe to persist or hide their activities. The process accesses might be normal, but combined with other events, they could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard tool to check user context, so maybe the attacker is checking privileges. The powershell.exe events include creating a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files. The script name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_... which sounds like a test, but maybe it's actually malicious.\n\nAlso, multiple image loads from .NET Framework DLLs.

The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to look at all of them together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The first one mentions a file deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to hide, but deleting a script might be part of cleanup. However, the other events are mostly PowerShell processes with various tasks like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, and others. There are several instances of 'powershell.exe & {}' which might be empty commands, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'File created' event for a winlogbeat configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if someone is setting it up. But then there are multiple PowerShell commands checking for the existence of various .bat files in different paths. The paths have some non-English terms like \"entrada_principal\" and \"modulo_geral,\" which might be obfuscation or just normal names. However, the fact that they're checking for these files in multiple locations could be part of a script trying to locate other files, which might be suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These could be part of normal operations, but if they're happening in quick succession or with unusual parameters, it might indicate something. However, the command lines here are mostly empty or checking paths. The 'whoami.exe' command is benign, just checking the user.\n\nThe deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp folder could be part of a malicious activity, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The multiple checks for .bat files might be part of a script trying to find and execute other files, which is a common technique in malware. However, the presence of legitimate processes like winlogbeat and normal PowerShell commands complicates things.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The main suspicious points are the multiple path checks and the deleted script. However, without seeing the actual content of the scripts or more events indicating malicious behavior (like network connections, unauthorized access, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence level might be moderate. But since there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, maybe it's leaning towards interesting but not certain.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze a bunch of system log events in JSONL format and determine if they're relevant for investigation. The answer needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to look through all the events. Let's see. There are multiple entries related to powershell.exe. The first event is a process create with a command line that checks if a certain batch file exists. Then there are several image loaded events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. There's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory, and another file created in Downloads. Then there are a bunch of chrome.exe events related to registry value sets, and some pipe created events. Finally, more powershell.exe commands checking paths again.\n\nHmm. The first thing I notice is that PowerShell is being used multiple times. But PowerShell is a common tool, so that alone isn't suspicious. However, looking at the command lines, they're checking if certain batch files exist and exiting based on that. That might be part of a script that's trying to determine if a file is present, which could be part of a larger process. But why would that be suspicious? Maybe if the paths are unusual or if there's a pattern.\n\nThen there are the image loads. The DLLs loaded are from .NET and Windows Defender. That's normal, but maybe the fact that so many are loaded from PowerShell could be a sign. However, PowerShell can load these DLLs as part of normal operations. The file creation and deletion in the Temp directory might be normal too, like temporary files being created and then cleaned up. The same with the file in Downloads, maybe a user downloaded something. But the justification for being interesting would need to be more concrete.\n\nThe chrome.exe events are all about registry value sets. If there are a lot of registry changes, that could be a red flag, but the user didn't specify any malicious activity here. However, the number of events might be high. Let me count: there are 8 chrome.exe events with registry changes. That's a lot. But maybe the user is just doing normal operations. However, if the registry changes are related to malicious activity, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the justification needs to be based on the combination of events. The PowerShell events are checking paths, which might be part of a script that's trying to execute certain files if they exist. The multiple checks for different paths might be part of a dropper or something that's looking for specific files. However, without seeing the actual content of the batch files or more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that there are multiple such checks might indicate that the user is trying to run scripts conditionally based on the presence of certain files.\n\nAnother point is the image loads from Windows Defender. Maybe the attacker is trying to bypass Defender by using its DLLs, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the presence of Defender DLLs being loaded could be normal. The file creation in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be related to PowerShell profiles, which could be a sign of configuration changes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe chrome.exe registry changes could be part of a browser extension or some legitimate configuration. But if they're all the same key or value, that might be suspicious. However, the data isn't provided here, so I can't be sure. The user might be doing something benign, but the combination of multiple PowerShell checks, image loads, and registry changes could be a sign of something more.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands checking for the existence of batch files in various paths might indicate an attempt to execute scripts conditionally. The high number of registry changes by chrome.exe could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But the fact that there are multiple events that could be considered unusual (like multiple path checks and registry changes) might make this batch of events worth investigating. Therefore, the classification would be \"interesting\" with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Interesting\",\n  \"justification\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell commands checking for the existence of batch files in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat`), which could indicate conditional execution logic or script obfuscation. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications by Chrome.exe (8 events) and multiple image-load events involving Windows Defender DLLs, which may warrant further investigation for potential evasion techniques or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve 'powershell.exe' with various tasks like 'Registry value set', 'Process Create', 'Process accessed', 'Image loaded', and 'File created'. The 'Image loaded' events mention several DLLs, some of which are part of the .NET framework, which is normal. However, there's also a 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender, which might be benign, but I should note that.\n\nLooking at the 'command_line' field in some events, there's a pattern. The PowerShell commands are creating new items (files) and setting their content to \"dir\". The paths here are a bit suspicious because they involve multiple directory traversals with \"..\" which might indicate attempts to write files in different locations, possibly trying to evade detection. The filenames end with \"_script.bat\" which could be part of a larger attack, like creating malicious scripts.\n\nThere's also a 'File created' event in the Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to drop files. The filename is a PowerShell script, which might be part of an attack chain.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes, creating files, modifying the registry, loading images, and creating scripts in temporary directories. This could be indicative of a malicious activity, like an attacker using PowerShell to establish persistence or execute commands. The repetition of similar commands across different paths might suggest automation or a script that's trying to spread or modify the system.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and the .NET DLLs are part of normal operations. But the combination of events, especially the creation of multiple scripts in various locations and the use of directory traversal, raises a red flag. The presence of the Temp file creation is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows a pattern that's consistent with an attack, even though individual events might not be conclusive. The key is the aggregation of these events pointing towards unauthorized file creation, registry changes, and script execution, which are typical in malware scenarios.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Indicators of Suspicion:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Multiple `command_line` entries show PowerShell commands creating files (e.g., `New-Item`) and writing `\"dir\"` to them. These scripts use **directory traversal (`..`)** in file paths (e.g., `C:\\elemento_geral\\elemento_auxiliar\\..\\pacote_padrao\\objeto_principal_script.bat`), suggesting attempts to **write files in non-obvious locations** or evade detection.\n\n2. **File Creation in Temporary Directories**:\n   - A file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1` is created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`, a common location for **malware to drop payloads**. The filename includes `PSScriptPolicyTest`, which might mimic legitimate PowerShell testing tools but could be a **stealthy payload**.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Activity**:\n   - Events involving **\"Registry value set\"** and **\"Process Create\"** suggest attempts to **modify system behavior** or execute malicious code. The combination with file creation points to **persistence mechanisms** or command-and-control (C2) setup.\n\n4. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - While some loaded DLLs (e.g., .NET framework components) are benign, the presence of **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender) in the list could indicate **tampering with security tools** or false positives.\n\n### Contextual Considerations:\n- **PowerShell Usage**: While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the repetitive and structured nature of these commands (e.g., creating scripts in multiple directories) aligns with **malicious automation** or **script-based attacks**.\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**: No events explicitly reference benign administrative tasks, user-initiated actions, or known-good processes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events collectively suggest **suspicious behavior consistent with malware activity** (e.g., script injection, persistence, or lateral movement). Further investigation is required, including:\n- Analyzing the contents of the created `.ps1` file in the Temp directory.\n- Checking for unauthorized registry changes or process execution.\n- Correlating with network traffic (e.g., C2 communication) or user behavior logs.\n\n**Action Recommendation**: Flag the activity for deeper analysis and consider isolating the affected system for forensics."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like File Delete, Pipe Created, File Created, Image Loaded, and Registry value set. There are several instances where files are being created or deleted in temporary directories or user-specific paths. For example, the first event deletes a script in the Temp folder. Then there are multiple file creations in different directories, some of which look like they might be part of normal operations, but others are in paths that seem a bit generic or possibly obfuscated.\n\nI notice that some command lines are present, like the one creating a new item and setting content. The paths have a lot of '..' which might indicate navigating up directories, but that's common in scripts. However, the repetition of similar patterns in different paths could be a red flag. Also, there are several Image Load events pointing to .NET framework DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but when combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nAnother thing is the use of registry events. While registry changes can be normal, multiple registry value sets from PowerShell might indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThe presence of multiple FileCreate events in different directories might be part of legitimate scripting, but the combination with FileDelete and the use of temporary directories could suggest that files are being used for temporary execution and then cleaned up, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nLooking at the confidence, there's enough suspicious activity here to warrant further investigation. The classification would be INTERESTING because there are multiple events that could indicate malicious behavior, such as file creation and deletion in non-standard paths, potential obfuscation through path manipulation, and repeated use of PowerShell for various tasks. However, since these could also be part of normal administrative tasks, the confidence isn't 100%, but it's high enough to flag it for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several activities that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** Multiple entries show PowerShell creating or deleting files in temporary directories (e.g., `Temp` folder) or user-specific paths. For example:\n     - A script (`PSSession-3426483546`) is deleted from the Temp directory.\n     - Files like `estrutura_principal_script.bat` are created in non-standard, obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..`).\n   - **Path Manipulation:** The use of `..` in paths (e.g., `modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..`) suggests potential obfuscation or attempts to navigate directory structures, which is common in both legitimate scripts and malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Registry and Provider Lifecycle Events:**\n   - PowerShell triggers **Registry value set** events and **Provider Lifecycle** tasks. While these can be benign, repeated registry modifications or lifecycle events may indicate attempts to alter system behavior or evade detection.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Multiple **Image Load** events reference .NET framework DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). These are normal for PowerShell, but their frequency alongside other activities could hint at complex or automated processes.\n\n4. **Testing File Existence:**\n   - The command lines repeatedly use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..`). This could be part of a script's logic (e.g., checking for prerequisites) but might also indicate a staged attack (e.g., verifying environment readiness before executing malicious code).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Interesting:**\n- **Suspicious Patterns:** The combination of file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, obfuscated paths, and repeated PowerShell activity raises concerns about potential **malware execution, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms**.\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimacy:** While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the absence of clear contextual indicators (e.g., user interaction, application-specific logs) makes it harder to distinguish between benign and malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n- **INTERESTING (High Probability of Further Investigation Needed):** The logs contain enough anomalies (e.g., obfuscated paths, repeated file operations) to justify deeper analysis, but they are not conclusive proof of malicious intent. Additional context (e.g., user behavior, network activity, process tree) would be required to confirm or rule out threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- Correlate these logs with **network traffic**, **process tree data**, and **user activity** to determine if the PowerShell operations are part of a larger attack chain (e.g., initial access, lateral movement).\n- Check for **unusual outbound connections** or **unauthorized modifications** to system files\/registry.\n- Consider using **EDR\/XDR tools** to analyze the PowerShell process for indicators of compromise (e.g., memory dumps, command-line arguments).\n\nThis batch is not definitively malicious but merits closer scrutiny."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist using Test-Path. The commands are structured similarly, each checking a different path. For example, the first event checks \"C:\\\\modulo_geral\\\\estrutura_geral\\\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat\" and exits with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. This pattern repeats with different paths in subsequent events.\n\nNow, why would someone do that? Checking for the existence of files could be part of a legitimate script, but when done multiple times with different paths, it might be a sign of something more. The paths mentioned don't look like standard system files. They have a lot of directories with names like \"modulo_geral\", \"estrutura_geral\", which might be part of a custom application or maybe a malicious payload.\n\nAnother thing to note is that some events mention file creation and deletion. For example, a temporary PowerShell script is created and then deleted. That's common in legitimate scenarios too, but when combined with multiple Test-Path checks, it might indicate an attempt to probe the system for specific files, possibly looking for configuration files or other entry points.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which seems legitimate. However, the majority of events are about PowerShell. Also, there are ImageLoad events for Windows Defender DLLs, which might be normal, but the repeated PowerShell activity is more concerning.\n\nThe key point here is the pattern of Test-Path commands. If an attacker is trying to check for the presence of certain files, they might be looking for files that could be used for persistence, configuration, or other malicious purposes. The fact that these checks are done across various paths might suggest that the attacker is mapping the system's file structure, which is a common initial step in an attack.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, like downloading files, executing payloads, or modifying system settings. It's all about checking file existence. So, it's a bit of a gray area. It could be a legitimate script that's checking for dependencies, or it could be the beginning of an attack. Given that there's no clear malicious action, but the pattern is suspicious, I'd lean towards this being worth further investigation. The high number of similar PowerShell commands with Test-Path is a red flag that might warrant closer look, even if there's no direct evidence of compromise yet.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves multiple PowerShell commands that check for the existence of specific files using `Test-Path` across various non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral\\...`, `C:\\entrada_secundario\\...`). While these actions alone are not inherently malicious, the **repetitive pattern** and **non-standard file paths** raise **suspicion** and warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repeated `Test-Path` Commands:**\n   - PowerShell is used repeatedly to check for files in paths that are not typical system directories. These paths include terms like `modulo_geral`, `estrutura_geral`, `pacote_principal`, and `registro_temporario`, which may be obfuscated or part of a custom application.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\componente_secundario_script.bat\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - Such checks could indicate **probing for the presence of specific files** (e.g., configuration files, payloads, or other malicious artifacts).  \n     - The lack of a clear purpose (e.g., no script execution or file modification) makes it **ambiguous** whether this is benign or part of an attack.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`tarefa_ativo.exe`, `registro_geral.exe`, etc.) is created and deleted, which is common in legitimate scenarios but **could be part of a cleanup or evasion technique**.\n\n3. **No Direct Malicious Activity:**\n   - No evidence of file downloads, execution of payloads, or system modifications is present in the logs.  \n   - Windows Defender DLLs (`ImageLoad` events) are referenced, but these are **normal system operations**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Suspicion:**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The paths checked do not align with standard system or application directories, suggesting **obfuscation** or **custom obfuscation**.\n- **Lack of Context:** The absence of clear purpose (e.g., no script execution, no user interaction) makes the activity **unexplained** and **unusual**.\n- **Volume of Similar Commands:** The repeated use of `Test-Path` across multiple paths could indicate **system reconnaissance** (e.g., looking for files that might be used for persistence or exploitation).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Not a clear-cut malicious activity**, but the **pattern of repetitive `Test-Path` checks** on non-standard paths is **suspicious** and **worth further investigation**.\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  - Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine the purpose of the file checks.  \n  - Analyze the files referenced in the paths (if accessible) to confirm their legitimacy.  \n  - Monitor for follow-on actions (e.g., file creation, execution, or lateral movement).\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict:**  \n**Interesting for investigation** due to the unusual pattern and lack of clear context. Not definitively malicious, but **requires deeper analysis** to rule out reconnaissance or pre-exploitation activity."}

So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation.

That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has a PowerShell script that checks if a certain file exists and exits with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario...\" don't look standard. Maybe they're trying to check for the presence of an executable, which could be part of a setup or a check for a payload.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for .NET applications, but loading them from the Windows directory is expected. However, the presence of Windows Defender DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be normal too, but sometimes attackers might try to bypass security software, so that could be a red flag.\n\nThere's a File Created and then immediately File Delete event for a temporary script file. That might be part of a legitimate process, like running a script and then cleaning up, but sometimes malware does similar things to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe other PowerShell commands are similar, checking different paths. The paths are all custom and not part of standard Windows directories. That's suspicious because legitimate software usually uses standard paths. Also, the use of Test-Path in multiple places could be checking for the existence of files that might be part of an attack chain.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user identity, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe cmd.exe process is checking if a temp file exists, which again is similar to the PowerShell checks. Maybe they're trying to see if certain files are present as part of a larger operation.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes checking for files in non-standard paths, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files. This could indicate someone trying to check for the presence of certain executables, possibly part of an installation or a backdoor. The repeated checks and the use of temporary files might be part of a malicious script trying to avoid detection. However, without more context like network activity or actual malicious payloads, it's a bit tricky. But the combination of these events does raise suspicion, so I think it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, as they suggest potential malicious activity or at least anomalous behavior. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Usage with Non-Standard Paths**:\n   - Multiple `PowerShell.exe` processes execute commands like `Test-Path` on custom paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`). These paths are not standard Windows directories and may indicate checks for the presence of files tied to an attack chain (e.g., payloads, configuration files, or staging locations).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and later deleted. This behavior is common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., PowerShell profile initialization), but combined with the other logs, it could mask malicious activity or clean up traces.\n\n3. **Loading of Windows Defender DLLs**:\n   - `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components) are loaded. While normal in some contexts, this could indicate an attempt to bypass or interact with security software, though this alone is not conclusive.\n\n4. **Repeated File Existence Checks**:\n   - The use of `Test-Path` across multiple PowerShell processes suggests a systematic effort to verify the presence of files in non-standard locations. This could be part of a larger operation (e.g., checking for installed tools, payloads, or dependencies).\n\n5. **cmd.exe with File Existence Check**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process checks for the existence of `objeto_logico.txt` in the temp directory. This mirrors the PowerShell behavior and reinforces the pattern of probing for files in non-standard locations.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:\n  - PowerShell and `cmd.exe` are widely used for scripting and automation. Temporary file creation\/deletion is common in legitimate workflows.\n  - Loading .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is normal for .NET applications.\n\n- **Malicious Indicators**:\n  - The **custom paths** and **repetitive file checks** deviate from standard behavior and may indicate probing for payloads, configuration files, or indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - The **absence of clear purpose** for the file checks (e.g., no obvious system administration task) raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Network Activity**:\n  - Check if these processes initiated network connections to external IPs or domains, which could indicate command-and-control (C2) communication.\n- **Inspect File Contents**:\n  - Analyze the temporary files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) for malicious code or hidden payloads.\n- **Monitor for Escalation**:\n  - Look for subsequent actions like privilege escalation, registry modifications, or persistence mechanisms (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry run keys).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not definitively prove malicious intent, the **repeated file checks in non-standard paths**, **temporary file manipulation**, and **loading of security-related DLLs** collectively suggest **anomalous behavior** that merits further investigation. This could indicate either a **legitimate but unusual workflow** or **early stages of a cyberattack** (e.g., reconnaissance or payload deployment)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are about processes being accessed, specifically powershell.exe. There are several instances where 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)' is logged. But there are also some other events, like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded'. \n\nLooking at the 'Image loaded' entries, they mention files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are .NET framework components. Loading these DLLs might be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen there are the command lines for some processes. For example, one entry has a PowerShell command that checks if a specific file exists. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...\" don't look like standard system paths. They might be custom directories, which could indicate that someone is trying to access or modify files in non-standard locations. \n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of the same commands. The PowerShell scripts are checking for the existence of various .cs files (C# source files). If these files are part of a legitimate application, that's fine. But if they're being checked in a way that suggests probing for the presence of certain files, maybe for exploitation or data exfiltration, that's concerning.\n\nAlso, the use of 'Provider Lifecycle' in some entries might be related to PowerShell providers, which are used for interacting with different data stores. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nNow, considering the frequency of PowerShell being accessed and the various registry and image load events, it's possible that this is part of normal system operations, especially if the system uses PowerShell extensively. However, the non-standard file paths and the repeated checks for specific files might indicate an attempt to access or manipulate files in a way that's not typical.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since there are multiple events that could be benign (like normal PowerShell usage and .NET DLLs), but some that are a bit suspicious (non-standard paths, repeated file checks), the confidence might be moderate. It's not a clear-cut case of malware, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, the logs show a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The presence of non-standard file paths and repeated checks could be indicative of something worth looking into, even if it's not definitively malicious. So, I'd lean towards classifying this as interesting for investigation with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious patterns**, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries involve `powershell.exe` executing commands that check for the existence of specific `.cs` files (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\...`). These paths are **non-standard** and lack clear association with typical system directories, suggesting **custom or user-defined locations**. This could indicate probing for files, which might be part of **malicious reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for the presence of specific code or data).\n\n2. **.NET Framework DLLs Loaded:**\n   - Entries like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `clrjit.dll` are standard components of the .NET runtime. While their loading is **normal in .NET applications**, their presence in conjunction with PowerShell scripts could hint at **exploitation of .NET-based vulnerabilities** or **custom tooling**.\n\n3. **Provider Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Some entries reference the `Provider Lifecycle` task. While PowerShell providers (e.g., `FileSystem`, `Registry`) are legitimate, the lack of context here makes it unclear whether this is **normal usage** or **abnormal interaction** with data stores.\n\n4. **Repetition of Patterns:**\n   - The repeated use of `Test-Path` commands across different paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\...`, `C:\\estrutura_comum\\...`) suggests a **systematic check for specific files**, which could be part of **malware behavior** (e.g., searching for configuration files, payloads, or targets).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Non-standard file paths** may indicate **custom or hidden operations**.\n- **Repetitive file existence checks** could signal **probing for sensitive data** or **preparing for exploitation**.\n- The combination of **PowerShell and .NET components** might point to **script-based attacks** or **tooling**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **mixed activity**, with no definitive evidence of malicious behavior but **sufficient anomalies** to warrant further investigation. The **repetition of non-standard file checks** and the **use of PowerShell in potentially stealthy ways** are red flags.\n\n**Classification:** **Interesting for investigation** (moderate confidence).  \n**Next Steps:** Correlate these logs with other system data (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine if the file checks are part of legitimate workflows or malicious behavior."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File deleted, Pipe Created, etc. Some of the files mentioned are related to Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate files, so maybe that's just normal operation. But then there are other files in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. It could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The script is testing if the file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. But why so many different paths? It might be that the attacker is trying to locate a keystroke logging script, which is a common malicious activity. Keystroke loggers are used to capture sensitive information, so that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be related to PowerShell's internal processes. However, the repetition of checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories suggests some kind of search or probing behavior. The user 'fiddelis' is involved in some of these events, but without more context on the user's normal activity, it's hard to say if that's normal or not.\n\nAnother point is the use of the Temp directory for creating and deleting files. While temporary files are normal, the pattern here might indicate an attempt to hide the presence of malicious scripts. Also, the fact that the same script name is used across different paths could be an indicator of a specific payload or tool being searched for.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like execution of harmful code or network communication. The logs are mostly about file operations and process creation. But the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 are suspicious. Keystroke loggers are often part of malware, so this could be a sign of reconnaissance or setup for a more significant attack.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the files mentioned are part of Windows Defender, which is legitimate. So, it's possible that some of these events are benign. But the combination of the Temp files, the repeated checks, and the script names points towards potential malicious intent. The confidence here is moderate because while there are indicators of compromise, there's no direct proof without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repeated Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Scripts**  \n   - Multiple PowerShell processes are probing for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in **various non-standard paths** (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_comum\\pacote_logico\\registro_secundario\\src\\`), exiting with status codes `0` or `1`.  \n   - **Why this matters**: `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a **common name for malicious keystroke logging scripts** used to capture sensitive data (e.g., passwords). The repetitive probing across different directories suggests **active reconnaissance** or an attempt to locate a payload.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**  \n   - A file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1` is **created and immediately deleted** in the Temp directory.  \n   - **Why this matters**: This pattern is often used to **execute scripts temporarily** and avoid leaving evidence, a technique seen in **malware** or **sophisticated attacks**.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**  \n   - Multiple `Process Create` and `Provider Lifecycle` events involving PowerShell, with no clear benign purpose.  \n   - While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in **repetitive file checks** and **Temp directory operations** raises red flags.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Windows Defender Files**: Logs referencing `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` are **normal** (part of Windows Defender).  \n- **Script Testing**: The `Test-Path` checks could theoretically be part of **legitimate script testing**, but the repetition and specific script names (`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`) make this unlikely.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **behavior consistent with malicious activity** (e.g., keystroke logging attempts, temporary file operations). However, **no direct evidence of execution or payload delivery** is present.  \n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- **Investigate further** by checking:  \n  - The contents of the deleted Temp file (if recoverable).  \n  - User `fiddelis`'s privileges and normal activity.  \n  - Network traffic from these PowerShell sessions (if available).  \n- **Monitor for follow-on activity**, such as exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.  \n\n**Risk Level**: **Medium** (suspicious but not confirmed malicious)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The logs show several ImageLoad events for .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal, but then there's a file created and then immediately deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks.\n\nThen there's the Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, that might be a red flag. Also, the command lines for powershell.exe have Test-Path commands checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths. Get-Keystrokes sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is definitely suspicious. That could be part of a keylogger or some malicious activity.\n\nThere are also entries about the Windows Defender MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. While those are legitimate, if they're being accessed in an unusual way, it might be a sign of evasion techniques. However, the presence of those files is normal, so maybe not a big deal here.\n\nOther processes like whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, and Calculator.exe are present. The whoami.exe is just checking the user, which is normal. The calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is also standard for some operations, but the fact that Calculator.exe is capitalized differently might be a typo, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe main red flags are the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being checked, the temporary file created and deleted, and the multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components. However, the presence of those .NET files could be part of a legitimate process. But the combination of the Test-Path commands for a keystroke script and the file creation\/deletion might indicate an attempt to execute or test a malicious script.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file is probably part of configuration changes, but unless there's something wrong with the file, it might be normal. The Registry value set events for powershell and notepad are not immediately suspicious unless they modify critical keys.\n\nOverall, the most concerning parts are the Test-Path commands for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and the temporary file creation. Those could be signs of a malicious script trying to check for existence before executing or hiding evidence. So, this might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Test-Path Commands:** Multiple PowerShell processes execute `Test-Path` commands checking for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in different directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...`). This script name is **highly suspicious** as \"keystroke capture\" is commonly associated with **malware** (e.g., keyloggers).\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is often used to **evade detection** or test execution paths.\n\n2. **Image Load Events:**\n   - **Legitimate .NET DLLs:** Loads of `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `urlmon.dll` are typical for .NET applications and Windows components. However, the repeated `ImageLoad` events for these files, combined with PowerShell activity, may indicate **exploitation of .NET vulnerabilities** or **sandbox evasion**.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `Pipe Created` event is logged. While pipes are normal for inter-process communication, this could be part of **data exfiltration** or **covert communication** between processes.\n\n4. **Windows Defender DLLs:**\n   - `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (part of Windows Defender) are loaded. While legitimate, their presence in logs may be **evasive behavior** (e.g., mimicking defender processes to avoid detection).\n\n5. **Other Processes:**\n   - **`whoami.exe` and `calc.exe`:** These are standard utilities, but `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` (used for URL handling) is unusual and could indicate **DLL hijacking** or **unusual execution paths**.\n   - **`svchost.exe` and `notepad.exe`:** Registry modifications are logged, but no clear malicious intent is evident without further context.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **High Risk:** The `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` script and file creation\/deletion pattern are **strong indicators of potential malicious activity** (e.g., reconnaissance, payload testing, or data exfiltration).\n- **Medium Risk:** The combination of .NET DLL loads and PowerShell activity may suggest **exploitation** or **sandbox evasion**.\n- **Low Risk:** Other processes (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `calc.exe`) are normal unless correlated with other suspicious events.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Script:**\n   - Check if the script exists in any directory (even if deleted) and analyze its contents.\n   - Monitor for further attempts to execute or modify this script.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Logs:**\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell Transcript Logging** or **Event Viewer** to trace the full context of PowerShell commands.\n   - Look for obfuscation or use of `Invoke-Expression`\/`IEX` in scripts.\n\n3. **Check for Unusual Network Activity:**\n   - Correlate the logs with **network traffic** (e.g., outbound connections to unknown IPs or domains) to detect data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Verify Windows Defender Integrity:**\n   - Ensure that `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` are legitimate (e.g., use `sigcheck` or **Windows Defender Offline** scans).\n\n5. **Monitor for Persistence Mechanisms:**\n   - Check for registry modifications, scheduled tasks, or service creation that could indicate **persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **clear red flags** (e.g., `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, file creation\/deletion) that warrant further investigation. While not definitive proof of compromise, these indicators suggest **potential malicious activity** and should be prioritized for analysis."}
