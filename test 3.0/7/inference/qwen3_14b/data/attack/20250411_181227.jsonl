{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe. They're setting up scheduled tasks that trigger at logon, with the Administrators group and highest run level. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges could be a way to maintain persistence. The names of the tasks are things like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"tarefa_geral\"—maybe obfuscated or random names to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are events about registry value sets and process accesses. The image loads are for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. That's normal for PowerShell if it's using .NET, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it might indicate something malicious. However, the presence of multiple events with the same command line might be part of a legitimate script, but the repetition and the use of high-privilege settings are red flags.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these scheduled tasks are registered with the Administrators group and highest run level could be an attempt to ensure the task runs with elevated privileges, which is not typical for normal user activities. The lack of file paths in most entries except for the image loads might mean that the logs are incomplete, but the process events are still concerning.\n\nI should check if there's any indication of malicious activity beyond just the scheduled tasks. The other events are about registry changes and process access, which could be part of normal operations, but when combined with the scheduled task creation, they might point to an attack. However, without more context like network activity or unexpected binaries, it's a bit tricky. Still, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin rights is a strong indicator of something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Abuse of PowerShell for Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands to create **scheduled tasks** with:\n     - **`calc.exe`** as the payload (a common indicator of obfuscation or test activity).\n     - **`RunAsAdmin`** privilege (via `-RunLevel Highest` and `-GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\"`).\n     - **Obfuscated task names** (e.g., `tarefa_geral`, `unidade_ativo`), suggesting an attempt to evade detection.\n\n   - Example command line:\n     ```powershell\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"; $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon; $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest; Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n     ```\n\n   - **Why this is concerning**: Creating persistent, high-privilege scheduled tasks with obfuscated names is a common tactic in **malware persistence** and **privilege escalation**.\n\n---\n\n2. **Unusual .NET Assembly Loads**:\n   - PowerShell processes load **.NET assemblies** like:\n     - `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`.\n   - While these are legitimate for PowerShell\/.NET operations, their presence **combined with the above task creation** suggests **code injection** or **exploitation of .NET** for malicious purposes (e.g., executing arbitrary code).\n\n---\n\n3. **Repetitive and Unusual Events**:\n   - **Repeated PowerShell activity** (e.g., `Process Create`, `Image Load`, `Registry value set`) without clear justification.\n   - **Lack of user context** (e.g., no mention of user interaction or legitimate scripts) raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Worth Investigating**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The scheduled tasks could be used to **maintain access** to the system even after reboot.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Using `RunLevel Highest` and `Administrators` group implies an attempt to **escalate privileges**.\n- **Obfuscation**: Task names and repetitive commands suggest **efforts to evade detection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Check for Actual Payloads**:\n   - Verify if `calc.exe` is being used as a **placeholder** (common in obfuscated malware) or if it’s part of a **malicious chain** (e.g., downloading additional payloads).\n   - Inspect the **scheduled task details** (e.g., via `Get-ScheduledTask` in PowerShell).\n\n2. **Analyze .NET Activity**:\n   - Investigate if the loaded .NET assemblies are being used for **code execution** or **exploitation** (e.g., via `Reflection`, `DynamicCode`).\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Look for **network activity** (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections) or **file modifications** that could indicate data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\n4. **Check User Context**:\n   - Determine which user account initiated the PowerShell sessions and whether they have **legitimate access** to administrative privileges.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis activity exhibits **strong indicators of compromise** (IoCs) consistent with **malware persistence**, **privilege escalation**, and **obfuscation**. Further analysis is required to confirm malicious intent, but the log entries **definitely warrant investigation**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through each entry to spot any suspicious patterns.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That path seems legitimate, but then there's a file created in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension. PowerShell scripts in Temp can be a red flag, especially if they're being created and then deleted. The next event shows that same file being deleted. That's unusual; why create and delete a script so quickly?\n\nThen there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Not sure about that yet. The next entry has a command line that's creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and setting the principal to Administrators with high privileges. That's definitely suspicious. Creating a scheduled task that runs as admin could be part of a privilege escalation attempt. The command line is using PowerShell to register a task, which is a common technique in attacks.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome doing that might not be normal, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the number of registry events might indicate some automated activity. But the main concern here is the PowerShell events.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks, but the process is listed as 'None'. That could mean the event source doesn't have process information, which might be a gap in logging, but it's also possible that those are false positives or unrelated.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities, especially the scheduled task creation with admin privileges, are a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior. Even though some events might be benign (like Windows Defender loading DLLs), the combination of creating and deleting a script in Temp, followed by scheduling a high-privilege task, suggests an attempt to execute code with elevated rights. The repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events might be noise, but the scheduled task is a clear red flag. \n\nConfidence is high here because the scheduled task with admin rights is a known attack vector. Even if some parts are normal, the overall pattern points to something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate suspicious activity, including creation of a temporary script file followed by its deletion, and registration of a scheduled task with elevated privileges (Administrators group, RunLevel Highest) executing calc.exe. This pattern is commonly associated with privilege escalation or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but loading DLLs from System32 might be normal. However, I should note that. Then there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process, but repeated registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're modifying critical keys. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Tasks directory called \"unidade_comum\". That path seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo or a malicious file? Then there are entries where the process is None, and the task is executing a remote command. That's concerning because if the process isn't identified, it might be something hidden or a security bypass.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but also a common vector for malware. The StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file might be related to PowerShell profiles, which could be used to execute malicious code. Also, there's a registry change from PowerShell, which might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nChrome.exe is involved in multiple registry changes and image loads. Loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll seems normal since those are part of Windows Defender. But the repeated registry changes might indicate some tampering. The DNS query from Chrome could be normal browsing, but if it's going to suspicious domains, that's a red flag. However, the data here doesn't show the domain, so I can't be sure.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, but creating a .yml.new file might be part of its configuration, which is normal. However, if it's being used for unexpected purposes, that could be an issue.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple registry changes, file creations in user directories, and some processes not being identified. The \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process are definitely suspicious. Also, the combination of PowerShell activities and registry changes could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute commands remotely.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, svchost and chrome.exe doing normal operations. But the presence of unexplained remote commands and the lack of process information in some events raises red flags. The confidence here is moderate because while some events are normal, the combination of suspicious activities and missing process data suggests potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Unusual file creation in system Tasks directory ('unidade_comum'), 2) Repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, 3) PowerShell creating files in user directories (potential script execution), 4) Chrome.exe triggering excessive registry changes (potential tampering). While some events are benign, the combination of unexplained remote commands and anomalous file\/registry activity warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
