{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be normal, but notepad.exe modifying the registry? Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe legitimate, but could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a normal tool. The next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by calc.exe, which is a simple calculator, that's unusual. Maybe a sign of something malicious?\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line includes creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. That's suspicious because creating scheduled tasks to run calc.exe might be a way to persist malware. Also, the command line has some strange names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" which might be obfuscated or part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. This seems like an attempt to set up persistence. Also, svchost.exe is involved in creating files in the Tasks directory. Svchost is a normal process, but creating files in system directories could be malicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of svchost.exe and other processes modifying the registry. While some registry changes are normal, the frequency and the context here might indicate an attempt to modify system settings for persistence or to hide malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks using calc.exe, the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to set up these tasks, and the involvement of svchost.exe in file creation and registry modifications. These are all indicators of potential malicious activity, especially the persistence mechanisms through scheduled tasks and the unusual process interactions. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of events here suggests a possible compromise. So, I think this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names triggering calc.exe, PowerShell process access, and svchost.exe file creation in system directories. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanism setup and lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through the events to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Some of these are normal system processes, like svchost and chrome. But powershell.exe is often used in attacks, so that's a red flag. \n\nNow, checking the winlog tasks. There are several Registry value set events. That's common in some malware activities, but not always malicious. Then there's a File created event for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. But the file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal. However, another File created event is for 'unidade_ativo.txt' created by powershell. That's a text file, maybe not harmful, but why would powershell create it? Maybe part of a script.\n\nThen there's an Image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. But if they were loaded from unusual paths, that could be a problem. The paths here seem standard.\n\nThere's also a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. That could be normal, but if it's being accessed in a way that's unusual, like by another process, that might be suspicious. Also, the whoami.exe process is running, which is a normal command to get user info, but if it's part of a larger attack, that could be a concern.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. There are multiple Registry events, but they're spread across different processes. The only potentially suspicious thing is the File created by powershell for 'unidade_ativo.txt'. Maybe it's just a normal file, but combined with other events, it could be part of something. However, the majority of events are from chrome.exe and normal processes. \n\nAnother thing is that winlogbeat is creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's not necessarily bad, but if it's part of data exfiltration, that could be an issue. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nConsidering all this, the presence of multiple Registry changes and file creations, especially by powershell, might indicate some activity worth looking into. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malware signatures, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the fact that powershell is involved in creating files and accessing processes could be a sign of something. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple events that could be indicative of suspicious activity, even if they're not conclusive. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's enough to warrant further investigation but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creation events involving powershell.exe and chrome.exe, including a file created in the Downloads directory and process access events, suggest potential malicious activity warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
