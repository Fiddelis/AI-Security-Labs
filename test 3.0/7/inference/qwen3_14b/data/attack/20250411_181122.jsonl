{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is executed. That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably benign. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a PowerShell command that uses findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. The command is looking for 'pass' in various file types and then using select-string with a pattern 'password'. This might be part of a password search, which could be suspicious if done without authorization. But is this necessarily malicious? Maybe the user is just trying to find passwords in their own files, but in a security context, this could be a red flag.\n\nThen, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, so loading them is normal when running PowerShell scripts. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events might indicate that the process is executing multiple components, which could be part of a larger operation.\n\nAnother thing to note is the File Created and then immediately File Delete events. A temporary file is created and then deleted. This is common in scripts, but if it's part of an attack, they might be trying to clean up traces. However, the file is in the Temp directory, which is typical for temporary files, so not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events with the same command line might indicate that the PowerShell process is being monitored or that there's some logging happening. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of normal operations, like configuration changes. Not suspicious here.\n\nOther events include notepad.exe and calc.exe, which are standard applications. The Image Load for urlmon.dll in calc.exe is normal as well.\n\nPutting this all together: The main suspicious activity is the PowerShell command searching for passwords. If this is done by an attacker, they might be trying to extract credentials. However, without more context (like the user's intent, the environment, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. But in a security analysis, any command that searches for sensitive information like passwords could be a sign of reconnaissance or exfiltration. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times might indicate automated scanning.\n\nI should also check if there are any other anomalies. The user might be running this as part of a legitimate script, but in the absence of such context, the presence of these commands could be considered suspicious. Therefore, this batch of events is worth investigating further to determine if the PowerShell activity is part of a legitimate process or a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes several activities that warrant further investigation due to potential security implications. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities**\n1. **PowerShell Command for Password Extraction**  \n   - **Event**: Multiple entries show a PowerShell command searching files for patterns like `password` using `findstr` and `select-string`.  \n   - **Risk**: This could indicate **credential harvesting** or **data exfiltration**. While the command itself is not inherently malicious, its execution in a security context (e.g., without user consent) may signal reconnaissance or exploitation.  \n   - **Context**: The repetition of the same command across multiple events suggests **automation**, which is common in attacks but also in legitimate scripts. Further analysis is needed to determine intent.\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**  \n   - **Event**: A temporary file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is created and deleted.  \n   - **Risk**: This pattern is often used to **obfuscate malicious activity** or clean up traces. However, the file is associated with **Winlogbeat** (a log shipper), which may be part of normal operations (e.g., configuration updates).  \n\n3. **Unusual DLL Loads in PowerShell**  \n   - **Event**: PowerShell loads .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`).  \n   - **Risk**: While these are standard for PowerShell, the **volume of Image Load events** could indicate complex or obfuscated scripts, which may be used to execute malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious but Notable Activities**\n- **`whoami.exe`**: A standard command to check the current user, typically benign.  \n- **`notepad.exe` and `calc.exe`**: Normal applications; the `urlmon.dll` load in `calc.exe` is part of standard Windows operations.  \n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: Likely part of log management or configuration changes, unless tied to unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events is **worth investigating further** due to the **PowerShell password search command** and **file creation\/deletion pattern**, which could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., credential harvesting or cleanup). However, some events (e.g., Winlogbeat activity) may be legitimate.  \n\n**Recommendations**:  \n- Correlate the PowerShell command with user behavior, file access logs, and network traffic to determine intent.  \n- Check for additional anomalies (e.g., unauthorized access to sensitive files, lateral movement).  \n- Monitor the Winlogbeat activity to ensure it aligns with expected operations.  \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**â€”the presence of password-searching commands and file cleanup behavior raises flags, but further context is required to confirm malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first event is about powershell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal, but maybe the path is a red flag? Wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... which is a legitimate location. So maybe not suspicious here.\n\nNext, there's a powershell command using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. That looks like a potential security risk because it's searching for sensitive information. But is that malicious? Maybe the user is just doing a search, but in a log, this could be part of a script that's trying to extract credentials. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Still, this command is worth noting.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe and other processes setting registry values. Registry changes can be normal, but if there's a pattern, like multiple registry changes from different processes, that might indicate something. However, svchost is a common host process, so maybe it's just normal system activity.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal because urlmon is part of the system for handling URLs. That doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nAnother entry shows findstr.exe being executed with the same command as before. This reinforces the idea that someone is searching for passwords in files. If this is part of a larger attack, like trying to find credentials, that's a problem. But again, it's a bit ambiguous without more context.\n\nThere's a file created in the user's AppData directory by PowerShell. That could be a sign of something, like a script being saved, but again, it's not inherently malicious. Maybe the user is just creating a profile or some configuration.\n\nMultiple registry events from chrome.exe and other processes. Chrome is a common application, and registry changes might be part of its normal operation, especially if it's updating settings or extensions. But if there are too many, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal. That's probably just part of its setup.\n\nLooking at all these events together, the main suspicious part is the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords in files. That could be a red flag, especially if it's done in a way that's not typical for the system. However, the other events don't show obvious signs of malicious activity. The presence of multiple registry changes and process creations might be normal system behavior, but combined with the password search, it's a bit concerning. However, without more context or other indicators like unusual network activity or unexpected process execution, it's not conclusive. So the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because there's a potential risk in the PowerShell commands, but not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell commands searching for passwords in files (e.g., 'findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls') and multiple registry modification events, which could indicate reconnaissance or configuration changes. While some activity (e.g., Chrome DNS queries, legitimate DLL loads) appears normal, the combination of credential-seeking commands and frequent registry changes warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": \"MODERATE\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user has given me a bunch of log entries and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's about chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender path. Wait, that's a legitimate path, right? Defender's files are usually in ProgramData. Maybe that's normal, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate files. But I need to check more.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. That's common for browsers, but if it's too frequent or modifying specific keys, it might be an issue. However, the entries here just say \"Registry value set\" without specifics. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are several network connections detected by chrome.exe. Chrome does connect to the internet, but multiple connections might be normal. However, if they're going to suspicious IPs or domains, that's a red flag. But the logs don't mention the destination, so maybe not enough info here.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. That's not necessarily bad, but if the file is malicious, but the names here are \"objeto_logico.txt\" and \"estrutura_ativo.txt\" which don't seem harmful. However, PowerShell is often used in attacks, so maybe that's a point.\n\nAnother event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring, so that's probably okay. But if it's being used in an unexpected way, but the log just shows a file creation, which is normal.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe cmd.exe process runs schtasks to delete tasks. Deleting tasks could be part of cleaning up after an attack, but the commands here are deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". If these tasks were malicious, deleting them might be a cleanup step. However, without knowing what those tasks were doing, it's hard to say. But the fact that someone is deleting scheduled tasks might be worth looking into.\n\nThen there's a schtasks.exe process deleting another task, \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". Again, if these tasks were part of an attack, this could be part of the cleanup. But if the tasks were legitimate, this might be a problem.\n\nThe svchost.exe event is about a registry object being added or deleted. Svchost is a system process, so changes here could be normal or could indicate something malicious. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: The main suspicious points are the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, the network connections, and the deletion of scheduled tasks. However, the logs don't provide enough detail on the registry keys, network destinations, or the nature of the tasks being deleted. The presence of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe deleting tasks might be more concerning, as it could indicate an attempt to remove traces of an attack. But without more info, it's a bit ambiguous. The user might need to check the specific registry changes, network traffic, and the content of the deleted tasks. However, based on the given data, the events are not extremely suspicious but warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not contain clear evidence of malicious activity, but there are a few notable points that warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **Legitimate Activity with Potential for Misuse**:\n   - **Chrome.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender's path**: The file `taskschd.dll` (loaded by `schtasks.exe`) is a legitimate system component. However, the presence of `schtasks.exe` deleting scheduled tasks (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, `elemento_base_005_OnLogon`) could indicate cleanup of potentially malicious tasks, though this requires context to confirm.\n\n2. **PowerShell and CMD Usage**:\n   - **PowerShell.exe** executing commands (e.g., `ProcessAccess`, `Registry value set`) is common in both benign and malicious scenarios. However, the deletion of scheduled tasks via `cmd.exe` (`schtasks \/delete`) could be part of an attempt to remove malicious persistence mechanisms, though this requires correlation with other logs.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Chrome.exe** and **PowerShell.exe** modifying registry values is not inherently suspicious, but the lack of specificity in the logs (e.g., no details on which keys or values are modified) limits the ability to assess risk.\n\n4. **System Processes**:\n   - **Svchost.exe** modifying the registry is normal for system processes, but the absence of additional context (e.g., which registry keys are involved) prevents definitive conclusions.\n\n**Conclusion**: While no direct evidence of malware or attacks is present, the deletion of scheduled tasks and frequent registry modifications by non-system processes (e.g., Chrome.exe, PowerShell.exe) merit further analysis. Investigate the specific registry changes, network destinations of the connections, and the content of the deleted tasks to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of schtasks.exe with the \/delete command. That's a scheduled task being deleted, which might be normal, but the name \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\" sounds a bit suspicious. Maybe it's a legitimate task, but sometimes attackers use scheduled tasks to persist.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe being used to delete processes, specifically notepad.exe. That's unusual because WMIC is often used in malicious scripts. Also, the command line has some redirection to suppress output, which is a common tactic to hide activities.\n\nLooking at the other processes, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. However, the repeated use of Registry value set events might indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify registry keys for persistence or evasion.\n\nThe presence of multiple Process accessed events for powershell.exe could suggest that someone is trying to interact with the process, maybe injecting code or accessing sensitive information. Also, the deletion of user accounts via net user \/del might be part of a larger attack to remove access points or cover tracks.\n\nAnother point is the loading of DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. AMSI is related to Windows Defender, so if an attacker is trying to bypass it, that could be a red flag. However, just loading these DLLs isn't necessarily malicious, but combined with other events, it might be part of a broader attack.\n\nThere's also the use of whoami.exe, which is usually benign, but in combination with other suspicious commands, it could be part of information-gathering steps.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows a mix of normal system processes and some suspicious activities like deleting scheduled tasks, using WMIC to kill processes, modifying the registry, and deleting user accounts. While some of these actions could be legitimate, the combination and the use of certain commands (like WMIC with redirection and deleting user accounts) raise concerns. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the overall pattern suggests potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled tasks (potentially removing persistence mechanisms), use of WMIC to delete processes, frequent registry modifications, and deletion of user accounts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, there's a bunch of events here. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see several instances of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. The winlog tasks mention things like Registry value set and Process accessed. But what's suspicious? Well, looking at the command lines, there's one that stands out: \"cmd.exe \/c net user \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". That looks like a command to delete a user account in a domain. Another one is \"net user \"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\" \/del \/domain\" from net.exe, and \"sc delete win32times\" from sc.exe. Deleting user accounts and services might be part of an attack, like removing evidence or setting up backdoors.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities. The repeated use of these commands, especially deleting users and services, could indicate someone trying to manipulate system configurations. The Registry events might be related to changing settings or hiding the attack's footprint.\n\nBut wait, some of these could be legitimate. For example, administrators might delete users or services. However, the combination of multiple deletions, along with ProcessAccess events, and the use of commands that modify system settings, raises a red flag. The presence of \"whoami.exe\" is normal, but the overall pattern of modifying system accounts and services without clear justification is concerning.\n\nI should check if there's a pattern of unauthorized access. The logs don't mention user accounts or authentication failures, but the deletion commands could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation. Since the events are spread out but show coordinated actions, this seems like a potential security incident. The confidence is high, but not 100% because without more context, like user authentication details or IP addresses, it's a bit tricky. But based on the process commands alone, it's definitely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of domain user accounts (e.g., 'modulo_auxiliar_Admin', 'pacote_auxiliar_Admin'), deletion of system service 'win32times', and repeated process creation\/access events for PowerShell and CMD.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is creating processes, accessing processes, and loading images. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, I should check for any unusual patterns.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries, there's a command line that deletes temporary files. The command line is \"del %%temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and similar. Using variables like %temp% is normal, but deleting files might be part of cleanup. However, the presence of \"calc.exe\" in the file names could be a red flag. Wait, calc.exe is the Windows calculator, but maybe it's being used here as part of a malicious payload? Not sure yet.\n\nAnother thing is the image loading events. PowerShell is loading several .dll files, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. That's typical for PowerShell scripts that use .NET assemblies. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but I need to check if it's being used in a suspicious way.\n\nLooking at the files created and deleted, there's a temporary file created and then immediately deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. That could be part of a script execution, but if it's being created and deleted quickly, maybe it's an attempt to hide the script. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to PowerShell's execution policy testing. Not sure if that's benign or malicious.\n\nThere's also a file deletion event for tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. The name \"decoded.exe\" might indicate that this is a decoded or extracted component of a malicious payload. The fact that it's being deleted after use could be an attempt to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe repeated events with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but the high frequency could be worth noting. Also, the use of \"whoami.exe\" is a standard command to check user context, which isn't suspicious by itself.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, deletion of temporary files, loading of .NET assemblies, and some file creation\/deletion. While some of these are normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to execute scripts, perform actions, and then clean up. The presence of \"calc\" in filenames and the decoded.exe file might be part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to tell. But given the patterns, it's likely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Image Loading**: PowerShell loads multiple .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). While common for PowerShell scripts using .NET, the inclusion of `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component) may indicate an attempt to bypass or interact with security software.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion**: A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This could be an attempt to execute a script stealthily or evade detection.\n\n2. **cmd.exe Activity**:\n   - **File Deletion**: Commands like `del %%temp%%\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt` and `del %%temp%%\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe` delete files with names containing `calc` and `decoded`. The use of `calc` (Windows Calculator) in filenames might be a red herring or obfuscation. The `decoded.exe` file suggests potential unpacking or execution of an encoded payload.\n\n3. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - **File Naming**: The presence of `decoded.exe` and filenames with `calc` may hint at obfuscation or evasion techniques.\n   - **Cleanup Behavior**: Immediate deletion of files after creation could indicate attempts to remove evidence of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Normal vs. Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - **Normal**: PowerShell's use of .NET assemblies and temporary files is common in legitimate scripts.\n   - **Suspicious**: The combination of file creation\/deletion, obfuscated filenames, and interaction with security components (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`) raises concerns.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity is benign, the **pattern of file creation\/deletion, obfuscated filenames, and interaction with security components** suggests **potential malicious intent**. Further analysis (e.g., examining the script content, checking for process injection, or correlating with other logs) is recommended to confirm whether this represents a legitimate operation or a security incident. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** due to the suspicious patterns and potential IoCs."}

That's a bit common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's an Engine Lifecycle task. Still normal. Next, Image loaded for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems legitimate. Then a File created in the user's AppData folder. Hmm, maybe normal, but sometimes attackers use AppData for malicious stuff. Then Registry value set events. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Process accessed events for powershell.exe. That's a lot. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so repeated access might be a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. That's a basic command to get user info, but if it's run many times, maybe part of a script or reconnaissance. \n\nWait, there's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper.

Calculator is a normal app, but urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer. Maybe not a big deal, but if it's being loaded in an unexpected context, that could be an issue. \n\nBut the main concern here is the repeated Process accessed events on powershell.exe. That's a common indicator of malicious activity, like PowerShell being used for command and control or executing scripts.
