So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a Microsoft Edge process creating a file in the Program Files directory under EdgeUpdate. The file is setup.exe. Then, the same process changes the file's creation time. That might be normal during an update, but sometimes malware does similar things to hide their tracks. However, Microsoft Edge's own setup files could be legitimate.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are part of Windows Defender, so that seems okay. But sometimes, attackers might inject malicious code into legitimate processes. However, just loading these DLLs doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event for setup.exe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which is normal, but if it's part of a malicious payload, that's a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple User Account Management events. A lot of them might be normal system activity, but if there's an unusual number, that could indicate something. However, the logs show several entries, but maybe that's just part of regular system operations.\n\nThe PowerShell command line is interesting. It's checking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. This could be part of a script looking for installation configurations. But the command is using Restricted execution policy, which is the default. Not sure if that's suspicious yet. Maybe it's part of a legitimate update process or a script checking for system state.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But if it's unexpected, that could be an issue.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries with registry value changes are part of normal system operations, but if there's a lot of them, it could be a sign of something else. However, without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Chrome DNS query is normal. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is also a standard part of Windows.\n\nThe svchost.exe process with the command line for BthAvctpSvc is part of the Bluetooth service, which is legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of these events seem to be normal system activities related to updates, log shipping, and standard process operations. The setup.exe and PowerShell activity could be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, there's no clear indication of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or known malware signatures. The presence of multiple log entries might be due to system updates or configuration changes, but nothing jumps out as suspicious. So, I think this batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation unless there's more context pointing to something else.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of normal system activities and legitimate process behaviors, with no clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Microsoft Edge Setup Activity**:\n   - A `setup.exe` file is created and its creation time modified in the `Program Files\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate` directory. This aligns with typical behavior during software updates or installations. No anomalies detected here.\n\n2. **Legitimate DLL Loading**:\n   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` loading `amsi.dll` (Windows Defender Antivirus) and `MpOAV.dll` (Microsoft Defender Antivirus) is standard. These are core security components, and their usage is expected.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A `Pipe Created` event for `setup.exe` is neutral. Pipes are commonly used for inter-process communication and do not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n\n4. **PowerShell Script Activity**:\n   - A PowerShell script scans INF files for `[defaultinstall.nt...]` sections. This could be part of a system check or update process. The use of `Restricted` execution policy (default) is normal, and no suspicious commands or payloads are evident.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` configuration file in the Downloads directory is consistent with log shipper setup or configuration changes. No malicious intent indicated.\n\n6. **SVCHOST and Registry Activity**:\n   - Multiple `svchost.exe` processes modifying registry values are typical for system services. Without specific registry key details, no anomalies are apparent.\n\n7. **Other Legitimate Processes**:\n   - `chrome.exe` DNS queries, `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`, and `svchost.exe` managing Bluetooth services (`BthAvctpSvc`) are all standard system behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs do not contain indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as unexpected network traffic, unauthorized access, or known malicious payloads. The observed activities align with routine system operations, updates, and legitimate software behavior. **No actionable threat indicators are present**, and the batch is unlikely to warrant further investigation unless additional context (e.g., correlation with external threat intelligence) suggests otherwise.\n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not interesting for investigation** based on the provided data."}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, maybe part of updating or configuration. Next, MsMpEng.exe (Windows Defender) loading taskschd.dll. Wait, taskschd.dll is part of Task Scheduler, but why is Defender loading it? Maybe a legitimate process, but could be a red flag if unexpected. Then winlogbeat.exe creating a config file. That's probably normal if someone is setting up the tool. \n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again. Not sure about this one. Maybe related to compatibility features. Then svchost.exe creating files in DeliveryOptimization folders. That seems okay, as svchost is a common host process for system services. MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an installer file, which is normal during updates. \n\nMpCmdRun.exe (part of Windows Defender) loading various DLLs. That's expected for Defender's operations. However, there's a File Delete logged event for a temporary Edge file. That's normal cleanup. Then, some registry changes by conhost.exe and mintty.exe. Conhost is part of the console host, so that's normal. Mintty is a terminal emulator, so that's also normal.\n\nLooking for anomalies: Are there any unexpected processes? The only ones that stand out are the multiple instances of MpCmdRun.exe loading DLLs, but those are part of Windows Defender. The git.exe creating files in node_modules seems like normal Git operations. \n\nWait, the first event was chrome.exe setting a registry value. Maybe that's part of a legitimate update. But then, looking at the file paths, nothing seems to be in unusual locations. All the files are in standard system directories or user downloads. \n\nHmm, but there's no indication of malicious activity like unauthorized access, unexpected network activity, or unusual process behavior.

There is no evidence of compromise or malicious intent.  \n\n**Classification**: **NOT INTERESTING**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all from git.exe creating files in the node_modules\\semver\\functions directory. Each entry has the same process name and the same task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files being created are all JavaScript files under the semver functions folder.\n\nHmm, first thought: git.exe is a legitimate process, commonly used for version control. Creating files in node_modules is typical during package installations, like when npm installs dependencies. The semver library is a well-known package for semantic versioning, so these files might be part of a normal installation process.\n\nBut wait, why are all these files being created? The semver package's functions directory contains various utility functions, so if someone is installing or updating this package, these files would be part of the installation. However, the logs only show file creation events. If this is part of a normal git operation, like cloning a repository, maybe these files are being checked in or out. But git usually doesn't create files in the node_modules directory unless it's part of the repository's structure.\n\nWait, node_modules is typically managed by npm, not git. So if these files are being created by git.exe, that might be unusual. Normally, npm would handle the installation of semver as a dependency. But maybe the user is using git to manage the node_modules, which isn't standard. Alternatively, maybe there's a misconfiguration or a malicious activity where git is being used to inject files into the node_modules folder.\n\nHowever, all the files mentioned are legitimate parts of the semver package. The functions like compare, eq, gt, etc., are standard functions in semver. So if this is part of a normal installation or update, it's not suspicious. But if these files were created in a context where they shouldn't be, like if the user didn't install the package, or if the files are different from the official ones, that could be a red flag.\n\nBut looking just at the logs provided, there's no indication of malicious content. The process is git.exe, which is legitimate, and the files are part of a standard package. The fact that multiple files are created in a short period might be normal during an installation. However, the absence of other events (like process starts, network activity, etc.) makes it hard to tell. \n\nAnother angle: if the user is a student working on a software project, as indicated by the folder name \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", then installing dependencies via npm would be normal. Git might be used for version control, but creating files in node_modules via git is not typical. Unless they're using git to track the node_modules, which is not common practice. \n\nBut again, without more context, it's hard to say. The logs don't show any anomalies like unexpected file contents, unauthorized access, or other suspicious processes. All events are consistent with a legitimate installation or update of the semver package via npm, even though git.exe is the process creating the files. Maybe there's a script or a hook that's using git to manage these files, but that's a stretch.\n\nSo, considering all that, the logs don't indicate a security threat. The activity is likely part of a normal development workflow, even if the process is git.exe. Therefore, the classification would be benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Benign\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The logs show git.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in the 'semver\/functions' directory within a project's 'node_modules' folder. These files (e.g., 'compare.js', 'satisfies.js') are standard components of the 'semver' npm package, which is widely used for semantic versioning in software projects. The activity aligns with typical development workflows, such as installing or updating npm dependencies. While git.exe is usually associated with version control, the creation of files in 'node_modules' is more characteristic of npm operations. No malicious patterns (e.g., unexpected file contents, non-standard process behavior) are present in the logs.

The fact that multiple files are being created in the node_modules directory suggests that this might be part of a package installation, like when npm installs dependencies. The tcomb library is a known package, so this could be a legitimate activity.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's anything suspicious. All the files are in the same directory structure, and the process is git.exe, which is expected during a git operation. There's no mention of any other processes or unusual activities. The events are all FileCreate events, which are expected during a clone or pull. Since there's no indication of malicious activity, such as unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or other anomalies, this seems like a normal git operation.\n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers might use git to exfiltrate data or inject malicious code. However, in this case, the files are standard library files. The presence of multiple files being created by git.exe in a node_modules folder is typical when setting up a project. Unless there are other events indicating compromise, like unexpected network connections or modifications to critical system files, this alone isn't a red flag.\n\nSo, the classification here would likely be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events describe a normal git operation creating files as part of a legitimate package installation. The confidence is high because there's no evidence of malicious behavior in the provided logs.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal git operations creating files in a standard node_modules directory structure. All files belong to the legitimate 'tcomb' library, and the activity aligns with typical package installation behavior. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. All the events are about files being created in the node_modules\\tcomb\\lib directory by git.exe. The files are JavaScript and TypeScript files, which seem to be part of a library. Since git.exe is typically used for version control, it's possible that these files are being checked in or out as part of a normal workflow. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in a short period might be unusual. But considering that git operations often involve creating or modifying files, especially during a commit or clone, this might be a normal activity. There's no indication of malicious behavior here, like unexpected file types or paths that don't align with typical git operations. The user might be working on a project that uses the tcomb library, and these files are part of the project's dependencies. Without more context or additional suspicious activities, these events alone don't seem to warrant an investigation. So, I'd classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard file creation operations by git.exe during a typical software development workflow.
