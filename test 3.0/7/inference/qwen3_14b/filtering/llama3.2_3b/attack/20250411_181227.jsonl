The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries with powershell.exe. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe. Wait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows calculator, but using it in scheduled tasks might be a red flag. Especially when combined with other parameters like -RunLevel Highest and GroupId BUILTIN\\Administrators. That suggests the task is set to run with high privileges and for administrators, which is unusual. \n\nAlso, the same command is repeated multiple times with different task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"entrada_ativo\", etc. That repetition might indicate an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, which could be part of a persistence mechanism. \n\nThen there are entries about image loads, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are related to .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory might be part of script execution, which isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with the other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe other events are about chrome.exe and registry changes, which don't seem immediately suspicious. The \"Execute a Remote Command\" entries are a bit concerning, but since the process is None, maybe they're just placeholders or incomplete logs. \n\nPutting it all together: the repeated use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, using calc.exe (which is a common technique to test if the task works, but could be a placeholder for more malicious payloads), and the multiple task creations, all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though calc.exe is benign, the method and the repetition are suspicious. This would likely be flagged by an analyst as needing further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially malicious activity** and warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating **scheduled tasks** with the following parameters:\n     - `New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"`: While `calc.exe` is a legitimate utility, its use here may be a **test payload** or a **placeholder** for a malicious executable.\n     - `-RunLevel Highest`: Tasks are configured to run with **highest privileges**, which is highly unusual for benign operations.\n     - `-GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\"`: Tasks are set to execute for **administrators**, suggesting **privilege escalation** or **persistence** attempts.\n   - **Task Names**: Repeated task names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `estrutura_auxiliar`, `unidade_comum`) may indicate **automation** or **mass deployment** of tasks, which is suspicious in a non-administrative context.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in **script obfuscation** or **execution evasion** techniques.\n\n3. **Unusual Event Types**:\n   - Multiple entries under **\"Execute a Remote Command\"** (with `process: None`) may indicate **incomplete logs** or **remote execution attempts** that were not fully captured.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Concerning:**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: Creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges is a classic technique for **maintaining access** to a system.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: The use of `-RunLevel Highest` suggests an attempt to **bypass user-level restrictions**.\n- **Obfuscation**: The temporary file creation\/deletion could be part of **script obfuscation** to avoid detection by antivirus or logging systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check for `calc.exe` Replacement**:\n   - Verify if the actual payload (instead of `calc.exe`) was executed via the scheduled task. Check memory dumps or process tree analysis.\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Investigate the deleted temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) for obfuscation or malicious code.\n3. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Review the system's scheduled tasks for any unauthorized or suspicious entries.\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate if the \"Remote Command\" events correlate with external IP addresses or user accounts.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and likely part of an **attack chain** (e.g., initial access, persistence, privilege escalation). Immediate forensic analysis and containment are recommended."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's a common system process, so maybe normal, but not necessarily suspicious. Then another svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, the Tasks directory is often used by scheduled tasks. The filename \"unidade_comum\" doesn't ring a bell, but maybe it's a legitimate task? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, two events with \"Execute a Remote Command\" and no process. That's odd. If the process is None, maybe the event is from a source that doesn't track the process, or it's a false positive? But executing remote commands without a clear process could be a red flag. Maybe something like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited?\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder. That's common for PowerShell profiles, but the path mentioned is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Maybe it's just a normal profile file. Not sure yet. But if there's unexpected content there, that could be an issue.\n\nChrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate DLLs from Windows Defender. So that seems normal. Chrome loading them might be part of its own security checks or integration with Defender. Not suspicious here.\n\nThen, Chrome.exe making several registry changes. But the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and the file is None. Without knowing what specific registry keys are modified, it's hard to tell. Maybe just normal operations, but could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe last event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file in its data directory seems normal. Unless the file is unexpected, but the name is .yml.new, which is a temporary file during configuration. That might be part of a user updating the configuration, not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. The most suspicious parts are the \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process, and the svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory. Also, the multiple registry changes by Chrome. But I need to check if these are isolated or part of a larger pattern.\n\nHowever, the presence of \"Execute a Remote Command\" without a process might indicate a potential issue, like a remote exploit. But without more context, like the command executed or the source IP, it's hard to be certain. The svchost.exe creating a task might be legitimate if it's a scheduled task, but sometimes attackers use svchost to hide malicious activities.\n\nThe other events seem normal, like Chrome loading Defender DLLs and PowerShell creating a profile. But combined with the other suspicious events, maybe there's something here. However, without more evidence like unusual network activity, unexpected files, or known malicious hashes, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting.\n\nBut considering that there are multiple events that could be indicative of an attack (remote command execution, unexpected file creation by svchost), even if some are normal, the combination might warrant further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence, since some events are suspicious but not conclusive on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows Tasks directory (potential persistence mechanism), multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process (possible lateral movement or exploitation), and Chrome.exe making repeated registry modifications (could indicate tampering). While some events may be benign, the combination raises concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
