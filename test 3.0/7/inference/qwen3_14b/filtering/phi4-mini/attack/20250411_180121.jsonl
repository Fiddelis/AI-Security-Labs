So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a powershell.exe process that's downloading files from GitHub URLs. Wait, the command line shows DownloadFile being used with URLs from raw.githubusercontent.com. That's a common technique for downloading files, but the paths are pointing to LICENSE.txt files. Hmm, but the filenames are generic, which might be a red flag. Also, the fact that there are multiple such downloads from different repositories could indicate something.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe is creating and deleting temporary files. The file paths are in the Temp directory, which is typical for temporary files, but the creation and immediate deletion might be part of a script's operation. Also, there are image load events for .NET DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, the command lines in some entries have the same structure: using WebClient to download a LICENSE.txt file from GitHub. The URLs are from different repositories, but the pattern is similar. That might be part of a legitimate activity, like fetching license information. However, the repetition of such events could be indicative of something. But I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nAlso, there's a Pipe Created event for PowerShell, which isn't necessarily bad. Then, another file creation in the Downloads folder. But again, that's a normal place for files. However, the combination of multiple downloads from GitHub, along with registry changes and process access events, might be worth looking into.\n\nWait, but the main thing here is that the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The key point is that the PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub. However, GitHub is a legitimate source, and LICENSE.txt is a common file. However, the fact that there are multiple such downloads, possibly from different repositories, might be part of a script that's being executed. But without more context, like if the downloaded files are being executed or if there's any other malicious activity, it's hard to say.\n\nBut considering the presence of multiple PowerShell events with network connections, file creations, and registry changes, even if they are legitimate, the sheer number might indicate something. However, in a normal environment, users might have scripts that do similar things. The presence of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might be part of some software's normal operation.\n\nAlternatively, the fact that the same command line structure is repeated multiple times with different URLs could be a sign of automated script execution, which could be benign or malicious. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there are multiple downloads from GitHub, along with other system events, might be enough to flag this as something worth investigating further. Therefore, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Multiple downloads from GitHub:** Several entries show `powershell.exe` using `WebClient.DownloadFile` to retrieve `LICENSE.txt` files from `raw.githubusercontent.com`. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the repetitive nature of these downloads (from different repositories) could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate use** (e.g., fetching license files for dependencies).\n     - **Suspicious behavior** (e.g., downloading payloads disguised as license files, especially if the URLs are obfuscated or the files are not actual licenses).\n\n   - **Temporary file creation\/deletion:** PowerShell creates and deletes files in the `Temp` directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`), which is common for scripts but could hint at transient malicious activity (e.g., unpacking payloads).\n\n2. **Registry and Network Activity:**\n   - **Chrome.exe interactions:** Multiple `Registry value set` events for Chrome are likely benign (e.g., browser updates or user preferences).\n   - **PowerShell's network connections:** The use of `WebClient` for downloads is normal but could be abused for exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication if the URLs are not legitimate.\n\n3. **System Events:**\n   - **Pipe creation** and **file creation** events are routine but, when combined with PowerShell activity, may indicate script execution or inter-process communication (IPC) that requires scrutiny.\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- **Repetitive GitHub downloads:** The pattern of downloading `LICENSE.txt` from multiple repositories raises questions about the intent. While GitHub is legitimate, this could be a **sign of automated tooling** (e.g., dependency management) or **malicious actors** using GitHub as a C2 server.\n- **Lack of clear benign context:** No entries explicitly confirm the legitimacy of the downloaded files or the purpose of the PowerShell scripts. This ambiguity warrants deeper analysis (e.g., inspecting the downloaded files, checking for obfuscation, correlating with other logs).\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n- **Analyze downloaded files:** Verify if the `LICENSE.txt` files are legitimate or contain malicious code.\n- **Check for obfuscation:** Examine PowerShell scripts for obfuscated commands or suspicious encoding.\n- **Correlate with other logs:** Look for additional indicators (e.g., unusual process tree, lateral movement, data exfiltration).\n- **Assess user context:** Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) is authorized to perform these actions or if this aligns with known workflows.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **interesting enough to investigate further** due to the repetitive PowerShell activity and the lack of clear benign context. While some behavior (e.g., GitHub downloads) is legitimate, the combination of events and the potential for abuse (e.g., C2 communication, payload delivery) merits closer examination."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe and registry value sets. Chrome doing registry changes might be normal, but repeated entries could be a sign of something. But maybe not yet. Then there's an entry about powershell.exe loading a file from a GitHub raw URL. Wait, that's a red flag. Downloading a file from a GitHub raw link, especially with a command that uses WebClient to download a LICENSE.txt file. That seems odd because LICENSE files are usually just text files, but the path is temp, which is common for downloads. But the command is using PowerShell to download it. Maybe that's part of a script.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be normal, but then there's another entry where winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file could be part of setup. However, if it's being done unexpectedly, that might be an issue.\n\nLooking further, there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe and then a network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but then there's a command line for cmd.exe that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task named \"spawn\" could be a sign of cleanup after a malicious task was run. The command is using SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F, which is a legitimate command, but if \"spawn\" is a task that was used for malicious purposes, deleting it might be part of evading detection.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. The combination of these actions—downloading files, creating files, modifying registry, and deleting scheduled tasks—could indicate someone trying to install or remove malware. The presence of \"spawn\" as a task name is suspicious because it's a common name for malicious tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the use of whoami.exe is normal, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack chain. The repeated registry modifications and file creations by PowerShell could be part of persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the PowerShell downloading from a GitHub raw link, the deletion of a scheduled task named \"spawn\", multiple registry and file modifications by PowerShell, and the presence of winlogbeat creating config files. These could be signs of a user performing malicious activities or an attacker trying to compromise the system. The confidence is medium because while some events are suspicious, others could be legitimate. But the combination increases the likelihood of it being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell downloading a file from a GitHub raw URL, deletion of a scheduled task named 'spawn' (common in malware), frequent registry modifications, and file creation in system directories. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of schtasks.exe with the command to delete a task named \"spawn\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task could be part of an attacker trying to remove evidence. Then there's the loading of taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, so that might not be an issue.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of cmd.exe and reg.exe deleting registry keys under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That's a red flag because modifying the Run key can be used to persistence, like adding a startup entry. The fact that they're deleting entries might be an attempt to clean up after installing a backdoor or other malicious software.\n\nPowerShell.exe is involved in several events, including process access and registry modifications. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands and scripts. The command_line for one of the cmd.exe processes includes deleting a registry value named \"modulo_temporario\" and another named \"pacote_auxiliar\". These names don't seem standard, which could indicate they're related to malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a lot of Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate, the high number of such events might indicate that PowerShell is being used to run .NET-based payloads, which could be part of a more complex attack.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell and the modifications to the registry, along with the deletion of scheduled tasks, all point towards someone trying to establish persistence and cover their tracks. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination and frequency of these events are concerning. I would classify this as interesting because the behavior aligns with typical attack patterns seen in malware and persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled task 'spawn' via schtasks.exe, repeated registry modifications in HKCU\\\\Run keys (potential persistence attempt), and excessive PowerShell activity with .NET DLL loading (possible malicious payload execution).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is involved in an ImageLoad task, and the file is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender's files are usually part of normal operations. But maybe there's something else here.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate and then a FileDelete for a temporary script file. The file path is in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts. But creating and deleting a temp file might be normal, unless there's something suspicious in the script. However, the event doesn't show the content of the script, just the filename. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which isn't inherently bad. But if there's a lot of pipes or unusual ones, that could be a red flag. However, this is just one event.\n\nLooking at the command_line entries, there's a lot of \"powershell.exe & {}\" which might be empty commands or just part of the process lifecycle. Also, some events mention ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess, which are normal but could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event related to winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be part of a legitimate setup, but if it's unexpected, it could be an issue. However, the user hasn't indicated any prior context.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. The first event's MpOAV.dll is a legitimate Defender file, so that's probably okay. The temp file creation and deletion might be part of normal PowerShell operations, like script execution. However, the repetition of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent for PowerShell could indicate something. If PowerShell is accessing processes or modifying the registry frequently, that might be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger attack.\n\nBut wait, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The presence of multiple events might not be enough on their own. However, the fact that there's a FileCreate and then a FileDelete for a script file in Temp might be part of a script execution that's trying to hide its tracks. Also, the Pipe Created event could be part of inter-process communication that's not typical.\n\nAnother thing to note is the multiple Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell. These might be related to event logging or monitoring, which is normal. But if there's an unusual number of such events, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the combination of file creation\/deletion in Temp, multiple process and registry accesses, and the use of PowerShell might be indicative of a potential security incident. However, without more context or evidence of malicious activity (like unexpected commands or connections), it's a bit ambiguous. But since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I think the answer is yes, because the pattern of events could be part of a larger suspicious activity that warrants further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **Windows Defender-related events**:\n   - `ImageLoad` of `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender) is expected and normal.\n   - `mscorlib.ni.dll` is a .NET runtime component, commonly loaded during legitimate operations.\n\n2. **Temp file creation\/deletion**:\n   - Temporary script files (e.g., `powershell.exe & {}`) are common in PowerShell usage, though the lack of content or context makes it ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell activity**:\n   - **Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` entries** for `powershell.exe` could indicate PowerShell being used for process manipulation or registry changes, which is often seen in malicious activities (e.g., persistence mechanisms, disabling security features).\n\n2. **Pipe creation**:\n   - A `PipeCreated` event could be part of inter-process communication, but without context, it’s unclear if this is legitimate or part of a covert channel.\n\n3. **Empty commands**:\n   - Repeated `powershell.exe & {}` (empty command) in `command_line` might indicate probing, testing, or obfuscation techniques, though this alone is not conclusive.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat file creation**:\n   - The `FileCreate` event for `winlogbeat` (a log shipper) could be legitimate if part of a monitoring setup, but unexpected usage in this context might raise flags.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some events are normal, the **combination of repetitive PowerShell activity, registry\/process access, and ambiguous file operations** suggests **potential malicious behavior** (e.g., script execution, evasion, or persistence). This warrants further investigation, including:\n- Analyzing the content of the deleted temp script (if available).\n- Correlating with network activity (e.g., outbound connections, DNS queries).\n- Checking for unusual registry changes or process injections.\n\n**Classification**: **Interesting for investigation** (likely benign but requires deeper analysis)."}

The first one is clrjit.dll, which is part of the .NET framework. That's normal, I think. Then there's MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That might be legitimate too. But then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a red flag. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like dropping a malicious script and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created and some registry value changes. The registry events might be normal, but if there's a lot of them, it could be suspicious. Then there are several entries for chrome.exe with registry changes. That's a lot of events. Maybe Chrome is being manipulated, but I need to check if that's common or if it's unusual.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one entry has 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like a no-op. Maybe a test or a benign command. Another entry has 'Remove-Item' trying to delete a zip file in the Temp directory. That's part of the cleanup, but if the zip file was malicious, that's a concern. However, the user might be testing scripts, so maybe it's legitimate.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is normal for checking user context. But the repeated registry events from powershell.exe and chrome.exe could indicate some automation or script that's modifying the registry. The fact that the same process is doing multiple actions might be normal, but combined with file creation and deletion, it's suspicious.\n\nThe confidence level here is a bit tricky. The presence of file creation and deletion, along with multiple registry changes, might indicate benign activity, but the same actions could be part of a malicious script. However, since some of the files are legitimate (like .NET and Defender DLLs), it's possible that this is just normal system behavior. But the repeated events and the deletion of a temporary file might be worth investigating further.

First, I need to look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to powershell.exe, which is common but can be a red flag if there's malicious activity. Let me check the events. There are several \"File created\" and \"File Delete logged\" events in the Temp directory. The files have names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_... which might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but creating and then immediately deleting files could be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks.\n\nThen there are multiple \"Remove-Item\" commands in the command_line fields. These are PowerShell commands to delete files, which is normal, but the repetition and the use of -ErrorAction Ignore might be an attempt to avoid errors if the files don't exist. However, that's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nI also see some \"Image loaded\" events pointing to Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably just normal operation.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to powershell.exe. There are several entries where powershell is loading images like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others from the .NET framework. That's normal because PowerShell can use .NET assemblies. But then there's also a file created in the Temp directory named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1, and then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a file might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do that to execute scripts temporarily.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to remove temporary files, like Remove-Item on various .txt files in the TEMP directory. That could be benign, like cleaning up after a script, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe it's trying to erase evidence.\n\nAlso, there are events where PowerShell is accessing processes and the registry. The registry events might be normal, but if there's a lot of them, it could indicate configuration changes. However, the logs also include some events from chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times, which might be normal for Chrome's own operations, but repeated entries could be a red flag if they're unexpected.\n\nAnother point is the presence of Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The event where it creates a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation, but if that's the only occurrence, it's probably harmless.\n\nThe command lines for PowerShell show some script execution, but the specific commands are about removing files. However, the fact that there are multiple such commands and the creation of temporary files might be part of a script that's being tested or run, which could be benign or malicious.\n\nI should check if there's any unusual behavior. The loading of .NET DLLs is normal for PowerShell. However, the combination of creating a temporary script file, executing it, and then deleting it could be a sign of something malicious, especially if the script isn't logged or if there's no clear reason for it. But without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell. The justification for interesting might be the pattern of creating and deleting files, along with multiple registry and process access events. However, since some of these could be normal, the confidence might be moderate. But considering that PowerShell is often used in attacks, and the temporary files, maybe it's worth flagging as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system operations and potential indicators of suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** PowerShell creates temporary files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`, `objeto_padrao.txt`) in user directories and subsequently deletes them. This pattern is commonly seen in benign scenarios (e.g., script testing) but can also be used by adversaries to execute and obfuscate malicious payloads.\n   - **Command Execution:** Multiple `Remove-Item` commands targeting temporary `.txt` files in the `TEMP` directory suggest cleanup operations. While routine, this could mask transient malicious activity if the files contained executable scripts (content not visible here).\n\n2. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - PowerShell and Chrome.exe trigger multiple **Registry value set** events. Chrome's repeated registry modifications are likely benign (e.g., extension management), but PowerShell's registry interactions (e.g., `RegistryEvent`, `ProcessAccess`) warrant scrutiny if correlated with other anomalies.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell loads .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which is expected behavior. However, unusual or obfuscated DLLs in non-standard paths could indicate compromise.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - A file creation event related to Winlogbeat (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is likely part of its normal operation but should be validated against expected behavior.\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Transient File Operations:** The creation and deletion of temporary files without clear context could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or payloads without leaving persistent evidence.\n- **Frequent Registry Modifications:** While not inherently malicious, repeated registry changes by PowerShell may suggest configuration tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries **merit further investigation** due to the combination of transient file operations, PowerShell activity, and registry modifications. While many events align with normal system behavior, the lack of contextual details (e.g., script content, user intent) introduces uncertainty. A **moderate confidence level** is assigned, as the observed patterns could align with either benign or malicious activity depending on additional context.\n\n**Recommendation:** Correlate these events with endpoint behavior (e.g., process tree, network activity), inspect file contents if possible, and check for lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts."}

The winlog tasks are things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. The file entries are mostly None, except for a couple where files are created, like winlogbeat.yml.new and pacote_ativo.txt.\n\nHmm, the repetition of powershell.exe being accessed multiple times might be a red flag. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so frequent access could indicate something malicious. Also, the whoami.exe is being created multiple times. Whoami.exe is a legitimate tool that shows user context, but if it's being called repeatedly, maybe it's part of a script or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the file creation events, there's a winlogbeat file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe someone is setting up monitoring. But the other file, pacote_ativo.txt, doesn't seem to be a known tool. The name is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe combination of these events: multiple process accesses, creation of files, and the use of whoami and powershell.

The classification would be INTERESTING because there are multiple process accesses and file creations that could indicate an attack, but not enough to be certain. However, maybe the presence of winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, so maybe it's not that concerning. Alternatively, the repeated whoami calls might be part of a script, but without more data, it's hard to tell. I think the best call is to say it's interesting with moderate confidence, but maybe not high enough. Maybe 0.6? Or maybe it's not interesting because it's all normal activity. Hmm. The whoami is a legitimate process, and powershell is common. The file creations could be normal. So maybe it's not interesting. But then why the repeated entries? Maybe the logs are just noisy. I'm a bit conflicted here. On the one hand, there's no clear malicious activity, but on the other, the repetition might be worth looking into.
