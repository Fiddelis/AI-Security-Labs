The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I'll look through the events.\n\nThe first few entries are about DiscordSetup.exe being created and loaded. Then, Update.exe is created in the SquirrelTemp directory and runs with an install command. That seems normal for an installer, like when you download an application. Then, Update.exe loads several .NET DLLs, which might be part of the application's dependencies. \n\nBut wait, there's a lot of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. The rule is ProcessAccess, which is a bit vague. But looking at the paths, the files are being created in AppData\\Local\\Discord, which is typical for application updates. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events might be a red flag. Are they normal? Maybe, but sometimes attackers use process access to inject code or manipulate processes.\n\nAlso, the command line for Update.exe is --install, which is part of Squirrel's update process. Squirrel is a framework used for updating apps, so this could be legitimate. But the high number of ProcessAccess events might indicate something unusual. However, without more context, like known bad indicators or anomalies in the process behavior, it's hard to say. \n\nThe presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components is normal for applications that use the .NET framework.

However, I should check if there's any suspicious file paths or unexpected behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, most of them are related to Discord.exe and Update.exe. There are multiple entries about image loading, process creation, and pipe events. The first thing that stands out is the repeated mentions of Discord.exe loading ffmpeg.dll. Normally, Discord might use ffmpeg for some media processing, but loading the same DLL multiple times could be a red flag. However, I should check if that's normal behavior for Discord.\n\nAnother point is the presence of Update.exe. The command line shows it's creating a shortcut and using some setup icon. That seems like a standard update process. But then there are several image loads from .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. This suggests that Update.exe is using .NET, which might be normal for an updater. However, I should check if these are standard paths. The paths mentioned are in typical Windows directories, so that's probably okay.\n\nLooking at the process creation for Discord.exe, there's a command line with various flags. Some of the flags are standard for GPU processes, but the presence of --disable-features with a long list might be normal for testing or specific configurations. The URL in the command line is \"https:\/\/f.a.k\/e\", which looks like a placeholder or fake URL. That's suspicious. Why would a legitimate application use a fake URL? Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps it's part of a test. But if that's part of the actual application's behavior, it might not be a problem. However, if the URL is supposed to be real and this is a typo or placeholder, that could indicate something wrong.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Pipe Created events. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, but multiple pipes could be normal for a complex application like Discord. However, if there's an unusual number or if they're being used in unexpected ways, that could be a concern. But the logs don't show any errors or unexpected activity related to the pipes.\n\nThe repetition of certain events, like image loading the same DLLs multiple times, might be normal if the application is initializing different components. However, if the same DLL is loaded repeatedly without a clear reason, that could indicate a problem. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the user's environment. If this is a user's machine and they're not a developer, having a fake URL in the command line might be a sign of a compromised application. But if the user is a developer or running a test environment, it might be expected.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the fake URL in the command line and the repeated loading of ffmpeg.dll. However, since these could be part of normal operations for Discord, especially considering the presence of multiple processes and the use of .NET for the updater, it might not be a security threat. But the fake URL is a bit concerning and might warrant further investigation. However, the logs don't show any clear signs of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or unauthorized access. So overall, while there are some oddities, they might not be enough to flag this as a security issue without more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not indicate clear signs of malicious activity or security threats. Here's a structured assessment:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Application Behavior:**\n   - **Discord.exe** and **Update.exe** are standard processes for the Discord application, including typical activities like GPU process initialization, media handling (via `ffmpeg.dll`), and update operations.\n   - Multiple **image load** and **process creation** events are consistent with a complex application like Discord, which may spawn multiple threads or processes for different tasks (e.g., GPU rendering, networking).\n\n2. **Suspicious Elements:**\n   - **Placeholder URL:** The command line for one Discord process includes a placeholder URL (`https:\/\/f.a.k\/e`). While this could be a test or development artifact, it raises questions about whether the application is misconfigured or intentionally obfuscating real URLs.\n   - **Repetitive Events:** Repeated loading of `ffmpeg.dll` and `.NET` framework DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) might be normal during initialization, but excessive repetition could indicate inefficiencies or unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No evidence of **unauthorized network activity**, **file modifications**, or **unusual process interactions** is present in the logs.\n   - **Pipe events** (inter-process communication) are common in applications with distributed components and do not inherently suggest malicious intent.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect normal operational behavior for Discord and its updater, with no definitive signs of compromise. However, the **placeholder URL** warrants further investigation to confirm its legitimacy, especially if the system is not in a development\/test environment. If the user is concerned, they should:\n- Verify the source of the Discord application (ensure it's from the official website).\n- Check for unexpected network traffic or system changes using tools like **Wireshark** or **Process Monitor**.\n- Monitor for additional anomalies over time.\n\n**Final Verdict:** *Not immediately suspicious, but the placeholder URL and repetitive events merit cautious follow-up.*"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: Discord.exe is being created with a long command line. The command line has a bunch of parameters, which is normal for applications, but I should check for any suspicious flags. The path is in the user's AppData, which is common for installed apps. The task is \"Process Create,\" which is a normal event.\n\nNext, there are several \"Process accessed\" and \"Image loaded\" events for Discord.exe. These are typical for a running application loading its own DLLs, like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, and libGLESv2.dll. Those DLLs are related to multimedia and graphics, which makes sense for Discord. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen, there's an \"Update.exe\" process creating files in the Start Menu Programs folder and the Desktop, like Discord.lnk. Creating shortcuts is normal during installation or updates. However, there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events for Update.exe. A lot of access events might indicate something, but if it's part of a legitimate update process, it's okay. However, the repetition could be a red flag if it's unnecessary.\n\nWait, looking at the file paths, the first file created by Update.exe is in the Start Menu Programs under \"Discord Inc,\" which seems correct. Then, a Discord.lnk is created on the Desktop. But why so many ProcessAccess events for Update.exe? Maybe the process is being accessed multiple times by different components, but that's not necessarily malicious. However, if the same process is being accessed repeatedly without a clear reason, that might be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to note: the command line for Discord.exe includes a --service-sandbox-type=none. That might be a flag, but I'm not sure. Some applications use sandboxing for security, so disabling it might be a concern. However, Discord might have legitimate reasons for that, like certain features requiring no sandboxing. Not sure yet.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for Discord.exe's DLLs is normal. The paths are all within the Discord application directory, which is expected. So that's probably fine.\n\nThe main concern here is the Update.exe activity. Creating shortcuts and having numerous ProcessAccess events. However, if this is part of a legitimate update process, then it's not malicious. But if the Update.exe is not part of Discord's official update mechanism, that's a problem. But the logs don't provide information about the source of Update.exe. So, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that multiple files are being created and the same process is accessed many times might be a sign of something unusual. However, it could also be a normal update process.\n\nAnother angle: the initial process creation for Discord.exe has a long command line with various flags. Some of these flags might be benign, but others could be indicative of tampering. For example, --disable-features or other flags that might be used to bypass security features. But the flags here are more about the application's operation, not necessarily malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some unusual patterns like the high number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe and the creation of shortcuts, without additional context or known malicious indicators (like unexpected network activity, unexpected file modifications, or known bad hashes), it's hard to definitively say this is malicious. However, these patterns could be worth investigating further, especially if there's no expected update process happening. Therefore, this might be considered interesting for further analysis, but not necessarily a clear threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **Discord.exe Initialization**:\n   - **Process Creation**: The `Discord.exe` process is launched with a standard command line containing typical application flags (e.g., sandboxing parameters). The path is legitimate (`AppData\\Local\\Discord`), and the command-line arguments align with expected behavior for a desktop application.\n   - **Image Loads**: Subsequent `ImageLoad` events for DLLs like `ffmpeg.dll`, `d3dcompiler_47.dll`, and `libGLESv2.dll` are consistent with Discord's multimedia and graphics dependencies. These are standard for a communications app.\n\n2. **Update.exe File Creation**:\n   - **Shortcuts**: The creation of `Discord.lnk` in the Start Menu and Desktop directories is typical during software installation or updates. Shortcuts are often generated to ensure user accessibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Excessive Process Access for Update.exe**:\n   - **High Frequency of `ProcessAccess` Events**: There are **20+** `ProcessAccess` events for `Update.exe` over a short period. While this could be part of a legitimate update process, such a high frequency of access without clear contextual events (e.g., file modifications, network activity) raises questions. This might indicate:\n     - **Malicious Behavior**: If `Update.exe` is not a legitimate component (e.g., a dropped payload), repeated access could signal persistence mechanisms or reconnaissance.\n     - **Legitimate but Unusual**: If `Update.exe` is part of a legitimate update process, this could be a false positive, but the lack of accompanying logs (e.g., file changes, network traffic) makes it harder to confirm.\n\n2. **Lack of Context for `Update.exe`**:\n   - The logs do not clarify whether `Update.exe` is:\n     - A legitimate updater (e.g., from Discord's official distribution).\n     - A rogue process (e.g., a downloader or installer from an untrusted source).\n   - Without additional evidence (e.g., file hashes, origin, or network connections), this remains ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs **merits further investigation** due to the following:\n- **Unusual Frequency of `ProcessAccess` Events** for `Update.exe`, which could indicate benign or malicious behavior.\n- **Absence of Context** for `Update.exe` (e.g., origin, file integrity checks).\n- **Potential Legitimacy**: If `Update.exe` is part of a known update process, the activity may be normal. However, the lack of corroborating logs (e.g., file modifications, network activity) increases the risk of missing a threat.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- **Verify the Source of `Update.exe`**: Check file integrity (hashes), digital signatures, and origin directory.\n- **Correlate with Additional Logs**: Look for network activity, file modifications, or user interactions involving `Update.exe`.\n- **Monitor for Anomalies**: If `Update.exe` is not expected, block or quarantine it until confirmed safe.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for further analysis**—not definitively malicious, but the patterns warrant deeper investigation."}

Those are common for applications that use graphics, so maybe it's just normal operation. But then there's a lot of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. That's a lot of entries—like 13 times. That seems excessive. Why would Update.exe be accessed so many times? Maybe it's a red flag.\n\nThen there's a FileCreated event for Discord.lnk in the Start Menu and on the desktop. Creating shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but combined with other events, it might be part of something. The reg.exe entries are adding a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to launch Update.exe with a parameter to start Discord.exe. That's a common method for persistence. Also, there's a registry value set for a Discord protocol handler.

That's typical for a running application. But then I notice several entries involving reg.exe, which is the Windows registry tool. The command lines show that reg.exe is adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. Specifically, they're setting the URL Protocol and modifying the default icon and shell open command. That seems like normal registry configuration for an application, but maybe there's something off here.\n\nWait, the commands are adding entries that point to the Discord executable. However, the paths mentioned are in the user's AppData directory. That's common for applications, but I should check if there's any unusual activity.

Squirrel is a framework used for Windows application updates, so this might be part of an update process. That's normal for applications that use Squirrel, like Discord.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are normal operations for Discord and its update process. The registry modifications seem to be part of setting up the application's associations, which is standard. The presence of multiple reg.exe commands might be part of an installer or updater. However, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unusual file access, network activity, or privilege escalation.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the entries are about \"Update.exe\" with ProcessAccess events. That's a lot of them—like 14 times. But then there's one event where \"Update.exe\" creates a file called Discord.lnk on the desktop. That seems a bit odd. Why would an update process create a shortcut to Discord? Maybe it's a red flag.\n\nThen there are some registry events and process terminations. But the key thing here is the Discord.lnk file. Shortcuts can be used to execute malicious code, especially if they're pointing to something harmful. However, just creating a shortcut isn't necessarily malicious. But combined with the repeated ProcessAccess events on Update.exe, it might indicate something's up. \n\nWait, but there's also legitimate activity here. For example, Discord.exe is being created with normal command lines, and image loads for legitimate DLLs like ffmpeg.dll. The user might be running Discord normally. However, the presence of Update.exe doing multiple ProcessAccess events and creating a shortcut could be part of a benign update process. But why so many ProcessAccess events? Maybe it's just logging normally, but the repetition might be a sign of something automated or even a script trying to access processes repeatedly.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set by Update.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence. However, without knowing what specific registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say. But the fact that it's happening alongside the file creation might be suspicious.\n\nBut then again, some of these events could be part of a legitimate software update. For example, creating a shortcut might be part of installing or configuring an application. However, the high frequency of ProcessAccess events might be unusual. Also, the combination of creating a Discord shortcut and having Update.exe involved might be a sign that the update process is being used to inject something else, like the shortcut pointing to a malicious payload. But the logs don't show the actual content of the shortcut, just its creation.\n\nConsidering all this, the presence of a single file creation event among many ProcessAccess events could be a low-level indicator of something suspicious. However, without more context, it's not definitive. But the fact that there's a mix of normal Discord activity and these repeated ProcessAccess events with a shortcut creation might be enough to flag this for further investigation. So, I'd say it's worth looking into, hence \"interesting\" but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `Update.exe`:**\n   - A `Discord.lnk` shortcut is created on the desktop by `Update.exe`. While shortcuts are benign, their creation by an \"update\" process (which is typically associated with software maintenance) raises questions. This could indicate:\n     - **Malicious intent** (e.g., a dropper or installer creating a backdoor via a shortcut).\n     - **Legitimate activity** (e.g., a software update creating a shortcut for user convenience). However, the absence of context (e.g., the target of the shortcut) makes this ambiguous.\n\n2. **High Frequency of `ProcessAccess` Events for `Update.exe`:**\n   - `Update.exe` triggers **14 `ProcessAccess` events**. While this could be part of a legitimate update process, the repetition may suggest:\n     - **Automated or script-based behavior** (e.g., probing or interacting with other processes).\n     - **Malware persistence** (e.g., attempting to access or manipulate processes for evasion or privilege escalation).\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - A `RegistryValueSet` event by `Update.exe` is logged. While registry changes are common, this could be a red flag if tied to persistence mechanisms (e.g., modifying startup keys or system policies). However, the lack of details about the specific registry key or value limits analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity:**\n- **Discord.exe Operations:** \n  - Multiple `ProcessCreate`, `ImageLoad`, and `PipeCreated` events for `Discord.exe` align with normal application behavior (e.g., launching a GPU process, loading DLLs like `ffmpeg.dll`).\n  - The command-line arguments and file paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\...\\Discord.exe`) suggest standard usage of the Discord application.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **low-to-moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further scrutiny. The combination of:\n- **`Update.exe`'s unusual file creation** and **frequent process access**.\n- **Registry modifications** by `Update.exe` (without context).\n- **Normal Discord activity** (which could be unrelated).\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `Discord.lnk` shortcut** (e.g., check its target, permissions, and timestamps).\n2. **Analyze `Update.exe`** for legitimacy (e.g., verify its digital signature, origin, and behavior).\n3. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network activity, user behavior) to determine if this is part of a broader attack or benign process.\n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** due to the combination of suspicious process behavior and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs), but not conclusive evidence of malicious activity without additional context."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about Discord.exe with tasks like Process accessed, Pipe Created, and Image loaded. There are a bunch of repeated entries for Process accessed and Pipe Created, which might be normal if Discord is just running and communicating. But then there are a couple of reg.exe commands modifying the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That stands out because modifying the registry, especially for a protocol handler, could be part of setting up a custom protocol, which isn't inherently malicious but could be suspicious if done by an application that's not expected to do so.\n\nLooking at the command lines for reg.exe, they're adding a URL protocol entry. That's typically used for associating a protocol with an application, like how Discord might handle \"discord:\/\/\" links. However, if this is part of a legitimate installation or update, it's normal. But if this is happening repeatedly or in an unusual context, it might be a sign of something else. \n\nAlso, there's an Image loaded event for ffmpeg.dll. While ffmpeg is a common library, loading it from the Discord directory might be normal if the application uses it. However, if there's any indication that the DLL is not legitimate or is being loaded in an unexpected way, that could be a red flag.

However, the repeated events might be worth investigating to ensure that there's no unauthorized activity. The confidence here is moderate because while the actions aren't clearly malicious, the frequency and the registry changes could be suspicious depending on the context.

That seems normal, maybe part of installation or configuration. Then there are several entries about Discord.exe with tasks like ProcessAccess, PipeCreated, and NetworkConnect. A lot of network connections and DNS queries could be normal for a messaging app, but maybe too many?\n\nWait, there's a reg.exe command adding a registry entry for the shell open command, which points to Discord.exe with some parameters. That might be part of setting up a protocol handler, like a custom URI scheme. But I should check if that's unusual. Also, the command line has --url and %%1, which might be how it handles URLs.

However, the combination with the network activity and the Temp file execution might be more concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of multiple network connections, DNS queries, and the execution of a file from the Temp directory might indicate something unusual. However, without more context or known bad indicators, it's hard to be certain. It could be a legitimate application with normal behavior, but there are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation. Maybe check if Widevine is expected here, or if the command line parameters in the ProcessCreate are normal for Discord. If not, then this could be a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal application behavior and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Behavior**\n1. **Registry Modifications**: \n   - `reg.exe` updates for Discord's default icon and protocol handler (`shell\\open\\command`) are typical for software installation\/configuration, enabling Discord to handle custom URI schemes (e.g., `discord:\/\/`).\n\n2. **Network Activity**:\n   - Frequent `NetworkConnect` and `DnsQuery` events are expected for a messaging app communicating with servers, checking for updates, or syncing data.\n\n3. **Image Loads**:\n   - Loading `ffmpeg.dll` and `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` could be legitimate if Discord uses these libraries for media playback (e.g., video\/audio decoding) or DRM-protected content.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Unusual Process Execution**:\n   - A `ProcessCreate` event for `Discord.exe` includes a command line with `--utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper`. While unzipping files is not inherently malicious, this parameter suggests Discord might be unpacking payloads, which could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate behavior** (e.g., installing extensions or updates).\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., unpacking a dropper or payload).\n\n2. **Executable in Temp Directory**:\n   - The `FileExecutableDetected` event for `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` in `C:\\Users\\...\\Temp` raises concern. While Widevine is a legitimate DRM component, its execution from the Temp directory (rather than a standard installation path) may indicate:\n     - **Unusual deployment** (e.g., a dropper unpacking the DLL).\n     - **Lack of digital signing** or tampering (not explicitly mentioned here).\n\n3. **High Volume of Pipes**:\n   - Multiple `ImageLoad` and `PipeCreated` events could suggest:\n     - **Inter-process communication (IPC)** for legitimate features.\n     - **Command-and-control (C2) traffic** if pipes are used to exfiltrate data or receive instructions (requires further correlation with network traffic).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Check File Integrity**:\n  - Verify the digital signature of `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` and `ffmpeg.dll` to ensure they are legitimate.\n  - Use tools like `sigcheck` or antivirus scanners to detect anomalies.\n\n- **Correlate with Network Traffic**:\n  - Analyze DNS queries and network connections to identify communication with unknown or suspicious domains\/IPs.\n\n- **Monitor Temp Directory**:\n  - Investigate why `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll` is being executed from the Temp directory. Legitimate software typically installs components in standard directories (e.g., `Program Files`).\n\n- **Inspect Unzipping Activity**:\n  - Determine if the `unzip.mojom.Unzipper` parameter is part of Discord's normal operations (e.g., updating plugins) or if it points to unexpected file paths.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs contain **mixed signals**. While some activity aligns with Discord's expected behavior, the **execution of a DRM component from the Temp directory** and **unusual unzipping parameters** warrant further investigation. This could indicate either a **benign application with atypical deployment** or a **potential security incident** (e.g., a dropper or compromised software). A deeper forensic analysis (e.g., memory dumps, network traffic inspection) is recommended to confirm the nature of the activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all related to Discord.exe. Each entry is a JSON object with process name, winlog task, and file set to null. The tasks mentioned are NetworkConnect, ProcessTerminate, and RegistryEvent.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if these logs are indicative of something malicious. Discord is a legitimate application, so normal activity like network connections, process termination, and registry changes might be part of its regular operations. However, the key here is the frequency and the combination of events.\n\nLooking at the logs, there are multiple NetworkConnect events. But since Discord is a communication app, it's expected to have network connections. The ProcessTerminate and RegistryEvent could be part of updates or normal shutdowns. However, if these events are occurring in an unusual pattern or combined with other suspicious activities, that might be a red flag. \n\nBut in this case, all the events are from Discord.exe, and there's no mention of other processes or unexpected activities. The logs don't show any signs of malware typical indicators like unauthorized access, unexpected file modifications, or unusual network destinations. Since all the events are related to a legitimate application's normal operations, it's likely not malicious. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. If all these events are from a single legitimate process and there's no anomaly, then it's probably not interesting. But if there's a sudden increase in network activity or registry changes that's out of the norm for Discord, that could be interesting. But based on the given data, there's no indication of that. \n\nSo, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because the events are consistent with normal Discord operations. The confidence is high since there's no suspicious activity detected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are related to normal Discord.exe operations (network connections, process termination, registry changes) without signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
