{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, and others. Some of these are common system processes, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are often used in attacks.\n\nNow, checking the winlog tasks. There are several Registry value set events, which might be normal, but when combined with other activities, could indicate changes to the system. The Image loaded events point to urlmon.dll, alegame.dll, and amsi.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected place or in a suspicious context, that could be a red flag. However, in the data provided, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location, so that might be normal.\n\nThen there's the command_line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete >nul 2>&1\". Deleting a process like notepad.exe might be benign if it's a legitimate action, but using WMIC to delete processes can sometimes be part of malicious activities, especially if it's part of a larger pattern. Also, the presence of WMIC.exe being used here, along with the command line, might be a sign of someone trying to manipulate processes.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of powershell.exe with Process accessed events. While PowerShell is a common tool, frequent access could be part of an attack, especially if combined with other suspicious activities. Also, the winlogbeat.exe event is about a file created in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file there might be normal if it's part of setup, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the file path is in the user's Downloads folder, which is less concerning than system directories.\n\nLooking at the WMIC.exe entries, there's an image loaded from a Defender-related DLL. That might be normal if the system is using Windows Defender, but again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system DLLs might be normal, but if they are being loaded in an unusual way or from unexpected locations, that's a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: there are a few suspicious activities, like the use of WMIC to delete a process, multiple PowerShell accesses, and some image loads. However, many of these could be part of normal system operations. The key is whether these events are part of a larger pattern. Since the batch doesn't show a clear sequence of malicious actions, but has some individual suspicious events, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. However, if these events are isolated and not part of a larger attack, they might not be significant. But given that there are a few red flags, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Event Log for Suspicious Activity:**\n\n1. **Suspicious Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:**\n   - The command line `cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete >nul 2>&1` is present. While deleting a process like `notepad.exe` may seem benign, the use of `WMIC` (a legacy tool often abused in attacks) to terminate processes could indicate an attempt to manipulate system processes or evade detection.\n\n2. **Unusual `ImageLoad` Events for System DLLs:**\n   - Multiple entries show `WMIC.exe` loading system DLLs such as `urlmon.dll`, `amsi.dll`, and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component). While these are legitimate files, their loading by `WMIC.exe` (a tool historically associated with malicious activity) raises questions about the context and legitimacy of these loads.\n\n3. **Frequent `PowerShell.exe` Activity:**\n   - Repeated `Process accessed` events for `PowerShell.exe` could indicate normal administrative tasks. However, combined with other suspicious activities, this might suggest an attacker leveraging PowerShell for further actions (e.g., reconnaissance or lateral movement).\n\n4. **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation:**\n   - A file (`winlogbeat.exe`) is created in the `Downloads` directory. While this could be part of a legitimate log-shipping setup, the absence of additional context (e.g., configuration files, user intent) makes this event noteworthy and worth investigating.\n\n5. **High Frequency of `Registry value set` Events:**\n   - The repeated `Registry value set` events (e.g., by `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`) could indicate normal system behavior or potential tampering. However, without correlating these changes with known malicious registry modifications, it's challenging to assign significance.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe event log contains **isolated suspicious activities** (e.g., `WMIC` process deletion, `PowerShell` access, and `ImageLoad` of system DLLs) that, while not definitively malicious, warrant further investigation. These activities could be part of legitimate system operations or early-stage attack reconnaissance. The presence of multiple red flags **suggests a potential need for deeper analysis** (e.g., checking for lateral movement, persistence mechanisms, or anomalous network traffic).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Correlate these events with network logs, user behavior, and file integrity checks.\n- Investigate the `WMIC` command execution and `PowerShell` activity for signs of exploitation or privilege escalation.\n- Verify the legitimacy of the `winlogbeat.exe` file and its configuration.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**INTERESTING (Moderate Confidence)** — The batch contains suspicious patterns that merit further investigation but does not conclusively indicate a confirmed attack."}

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. \n\nHmm, I notice that there's a command line in one of the entries for cmd.exe: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like someone is trying to replace the sethc.exe file, which is a common tactic in attacks to replace the Sticky Keys utility with a malicious version. That's a red flag.\n\nAnother entry has \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", which is deleting a scheduled task. Maybe the attacker is cleaning up after creating a task. Also, there's a Process Create event for schtasks.exe, which is part of the command to delete the task. \n\nThere's also multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. While PowerShell is common, repeated access and registry modifications could indicate something malicious, especially if combined with other suspicious commands.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe might be benign, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be used to gather information. However, the most concerning part here is the attempt to replace sethc.exe. That's a known attack vector. \n\nI should check if there are other indicators. The logs don't show any obvious data exfiltration or network activity, but the file replacement and scheduled task deletion are significant. Even without more context, the sethc.exe replacement alone is enough to warrant investigation. \n\nSo, the classification here would be INTERESTING because of the suspicious command line in the cmd.exe process. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.85, since it's a known attack method.

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Normally, that's a legitimate file. But MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender Platform. However, the paths here are C:\\Windows\\System32 and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... Those are legitimate paths. But maybe the fact that chrome.exe is loading these DLLs? Hmm, chrome.exe is a common process, but loading defender DLLs might be normal if it's part of some security feature. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries with cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe triggering registry value set events. Registry changes can be normal, but if there's a lot of them, especially from processes like powershell, that might be a red flag. Also, multiple process accesses and process creates. The command lines for whoami.exe and powershell are standard, but the repeated registry events and process accesses might indicate some automation or script running.\n\nLooking further, there are several image loaded events for powershell.exe loading various .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate .NET runtime components, so that's probably normal. But then there's a file created event for a temporary PowerShell script in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The filename is __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The presence of a script in the temp folder might be normal if it's part of a test or legitimate script execution. However, if this script is being created by an attacker, that could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The majority of the events are related to normal process operations and legitimate system files. However, the combination of multiple registry modifications, process accesses, and the creation of a temporary script might be worth investigating. Especially if there's a pattern of unusual activity that's not typical for the environment. But since the script is in the temp folder and the processes involved are common, it's not definitively malicious. However, the frequency of events and the involvement of PowerShell, which is often used in attacks, could indicate something suspicious. The confidence here is moderate because while there are no clear indicators of compromise, the combination of events might be worth looking into further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe process creations\/accesses, registry modifications, and loading of legitimate but often abused system DLLs (e.g., amsi.dll, clr.dll).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event shows a file deletion in the Temp directory by PowerShell. That's a bit suspicious because deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but maybe there's more.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be part of normal operations, but the repetition could indicate something. The command lines are all \"powershell.exe & {}\", which is an empty script block. That's odd because why would PowerShell be called with an empty command? Maybe a placeholder or a way to trigger an event without actual code.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That's probably legitimate. But then there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData, which might be normal. The Registry events and Process accessed events are common but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe interesting part is the multiple PowerShell commands checking for the existence of various batch files. Each one uses Test-Path with paths that have \"..\" which is a parent directory reference. This could be a way to check if certain files exist in different directories. However, if these paths are part of a legitimate script, it's okay. But if they're trying to access files in unexpected locations or if the scripts are malicious, that's a red flag.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with these Test-Path commands might be part of a larger script that's probing the system for specific files. Since the paths mentioned don't look like standard system files and have some obfuscation (like \"modulo_geral\" or \"estrutura_geral\"), it could be a sign of something trying to locate or execute scripts in non-standard directories. However, without seeing the actual content of those batch files or more context, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of multiple Test-Path checks and the empty command lines does raise some suspicion. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because while some events are normal, the pattern of checks and empty commands might indicate an attempt to gather information or test for the presence of certain files, which could be part of a reconnaissance phase.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with 'Provider Lifecycle' events and empty command blocks ('& {}') suggest potential obfuscation or probing behavior.

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event shows a process creation with a command line that checks if a certain batch file exists. The path mentioned is \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\...\" and then some other paths. The command seems to be checking for the existence of a script and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that. Not sure yet if that's suspicious, but maybe.\n\nThen there are several \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there are \"Image loaded\" events for various DLLs, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Those are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be normal, but sometimes malware does that to avoid leaving traces. However, the name \"__PSScriptPolicyTest...\" sounds like it could be part of a legitimate script execution, maybe a test or a policy check. But I need to check if there's a pattern here.\n\nAnother file created in the Downloads folder named \"elemento_padrao.txt\". Not sure what that is, but creating a text file isn't necessarily suspicious. Then there are multiple registry value set events from Chrome.exe. Chrome modifying registry values could be normal, but if it's a lot, maybe. However, the logs show eight entries for Chrome modifying registry values. That seems a bit excessive. Maybe Chrome is doing some updates or configuration changes, but I should check if that's typical.\n\nThen there's a \"Pipe Created\" event for PowerShell, which might be part of inter-process communication. Not necessarily bad, but sometimes used in attacks. Then more PowerShell processes with similar command lines checking for different paths. The paths have patterns like \"modulo_ativo\", \"modulo_logico\", etc. These might be part of a script that's checking for certain files in specific directories. But why would they do that?\n\nLooking at the command lines again, they all seem to be checking if a certain batch file exists in a parent directory and exiting with 0 or 1. Maybe these are part of a setup or deployment process. However, if these scripts are being executed frequently or in unexpected locations, that could be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple similar PowerShell commands are executed might indicate some automated process, but it's unclear if it's malicious.\n\nThe presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be a sign that the system is actively scanning, but it's also possible that the malware is trying to bypass detection. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of a legitimate process, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it might be worth investigating.\n\nThe Chrome registry modifications are a bit concerning. If Chrome is making a lot of changes to the registry, it could be a sign of a browser hijacker or some other malicious software. But again, without knowing the exact changes, it's hard to say. Maybe the user has a script or extension that's causing this.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points are the multiple PowerShell processes checking for scripts in specific directories, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the excessive Chrome registry changes. These could be signs of something malicious, but they could also be part of normal operations. However, the combination of these events might indicate that further investigation is needed. The system might be under attack, or there could be a misconfiguration. Since the logs show a pattern that's not typical of standard operations, I'd lean towards marking this as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Script Checks**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like:\n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\...\\script.bat\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - These checks occur across different paths (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`, `modulo_logico`), suggesting **automated probing** for specific files or directories. This behavior could indicate:\n     - **Malware reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for presence of payloads or configuration files).\n     - **Legitimate deployment scripts**, but the lack of clear purpose raises concerns.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is created and immediately deleted in the `Temp` directory. While common in benign scenarios, this pattern is also used by **malware to evade detection**.\n\n3. **Excessive Chrome Registry Modifications**:\n   - **8+ \"Registry value set\" events** from `chrome.exe` without clear context. This could indicate:\n     - **Malicious browser extensions** altering registry settings.\n     - **Compromised Chrome processes** (e.g., hijacking or injection).\n\n4. **Windows Defender DLLs Loaded**:\n   - PowerShell loads `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components). While legitimate, this could also suggest:\n     - **Antivirus evasion techniques** (e.g., mimicking Defender processes).\n     - **Legitimate scanning activity**, but the lack of clear context (e.g., no \"scan started\" event) is suspicious.\n\n5. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - Paths like `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`, and `modulo_logico` (Portuguese for \"active module,\" \"logical module\") may indicate **custom obfuscation** or **non-standard application structures**.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Likelihood of Benign Activity**: Low to moderate. While some events (e.g., registry changes) could be legitimate, the **repetitive PowerShell checks** and **temporary file deletion** are strong indicators of **malicious behavior**.\n- **Potential Threats**:\n  - **Malware probing for payloads** (e.g., checking for presence of `script.bat`).\n  - **Browser-based attacks** (e.g., Chrome registry tampering).\n  - **Antivirus evasion** (e.g., mimicking Defender processes).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Analyze the content of `script.bat` files referenced in the checks (if available).\n   - Check for **unusual parent processes** or **hidden modules** loaded by PowerShell.\n\n2. **Audit Chrome Activity**:\n   - Review Chrome extensions, installed software, and registry changes for signs of **compromise** (e.g., unexpected extensions, altered homepage settings).\n\n3. **Monitor Windows Defender Logs**:\n   - Check for **real-time protection events** or **malware detection alerts** related to the loaded DLLs.\n\n4. **Network and File Integrity Checks**:\n   - Use tools like **SIEM** or **EDR** to correlate these events with network traffic or file changes (e.g., unexpected file downloads).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events suggest **potential malicious activity**, particularly **malware reconnaissance** and **browser-based compromise**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm or rule out threats."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if they should be investigated further. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a bunch of PowerShell.exe processes. That alone might not be suspicious because PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks. But I notice a lot of \"Registry value set\" events. Maybe that's normal, but I should check for any patterns.\n\nThen, there's an event where PowerShell is creating files and writing content to them. For example, the command line shows New-Item and Set-Content commands. The paths are a bit odd, with a lot of ..\\ which might be trying to navigate directories. That could be a red flag because sometimes attackers use such paths to hide malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the files created, there's a temporary file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files, so that's suspicious. Also, the files created have names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1. The \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" part might be a hint that this is related to script execution policies, which could be a way to bypass security measures.\n\nThen there are several \"Image loaded\" events, which involve loading .dll files. Some of these are from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender, which are legitimate. However, the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that the process is loading additional components, which could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to create and modify files, combined with the registry changes and the temporary file creation, seems like it could be part of an attack. The fact that the same process is involved in multiple events, and the command lines show consistent patterns of creating files and setting content, makes me think this is not just normal activity.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. The presence of multiple suspicious activities, even if they are not conclusive on their own, adds up. The temporary file in a common malicious directory, the registry modifications, and the repeated file creation all contribute to a higher confidence that this is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits multiple suspicious patterns indicative of potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage**:\n   - **File Creation\/Modification**: PowerShell is repeatedly used to create files (`New-Item`) and write content (`Set-Content`) to them. The paths involve complex directory navigation (`..\\`) and are scattered across non-standard locations (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`). This behavior is often seen in malware to evade detection or persist on systems.\n   - **Command-Line Patterns**: The consistent use of `New-Item` and `Set-Content` with obfuscated paths suggests automated or scripted activity, potentially for payload delivery or persistence.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Frequent \"Registry value set\" events could indicate attempts to alter system settings, bypass security policies, or configure persistence mechanisms (e.g., modifying registry keys for startup entries).\n\n3. **Suspicious File in Temp Directory**:\n   - A file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1` in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory is highly suspicious. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which may reference PowerShell script execution policies, potentially used to bypass restrictions or execute malicious scripts.\n\n4. **Image Load Events**:\n   - While some `.dll` files (e.g., Microsoft.NET, Windows Defender) are legitimate, the repeated \"Image loaded\" events could signal the injection of malicious code or the execution of a dropper payload.\n\n---\n\n### **Confidence Level**\n- **High Confidence for Investigation**: The combination of PowerShell misuse, registry tampering, and the presence of a suspicious temporary file strongly suggests adversarial activity. While no definitive proof of malicious intent exists, the patterns align with common attack techniques (e.g., persistence, evasion, and payload delivery).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Analyze the Temporary File**: Check the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1` for malicious code, obfuscation, or indicators of command-and-control (C2) communication.\n2. **Audit Registry Changes**: Investigate the specific registry keys modified to identify potential persistence mechanisms or policy bypasses.\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Activity**: Implement logging and alerting for unusual PowerShell commands, especially those involving file creation, registry modification, or network communication.\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**: Investigate if the attacker is using the compromised system to move laterally within the network.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis event log is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware campaigns, particularly those leveraging PowerShell for persistence and evasion. Further analysis of the involved files, registry changes, and network activity is critical to confirm the threat and mitigate risks. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting – Investigate Further**."}

So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There's a lot of file creation and deletion, like the first event where a file is deleted in the Temp directory. Then there's a file created at C:\\componente_geral... and another in the StartupProfileData. Also, some image loads, like MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which might be normal, but others like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are related to .NET runtime, which is common but could be part of legitimate processes.\n\nWait, there's also some registry value sets. But the main thing here is the PowerShell activity. The command lines show that they're creating files, checking if certain paths exist, and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's checking for the presence of files. However, the paths are all over the place, some in user directories, others in system paths. \n\nI need to check if there's any suspicious behavior. The fact that multiple files are being created and deleted in different directories could be indicative of something. Also, the use of PowerShell for these operations is common, but when combined with multiple file operations and registry changes, it might be a red flag. However, some of the image loads are from legitimate system components.\n\nBut wait, the first event deletes a script in the Temp folder. Then there are creations in various locations. The command lines are using Test-Path to check for existence of files and then exiting. That might be part of a legitimate script, but the repetition and the number of events could suggest automated or malicious activity. However, without more context, like unusual network activity or unexpected processes, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe classification here depends on whether these activities are out of the ordinary. If the system typically has a lot of PowerShell activity, maybe it's normal. But given that there's a mix of file creation, deletion, and registry changes, along with multiple PowerShell commands checking paths, it might be worth investigating further. The presence of multiple Provider Lifecycle events and Engine Lifecycle could be part of a script that's running multiple times. \n\nSo, the answer is probably that this is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation, but not conclusive proof of malicious activity. Hence, the classification would be 'interesting' but not a clear threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **moderate suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** Multiple PowerShell commands create\/delete files in system\/user directories (e.g., `C:\\componente_geral\\...`, `C:\\modulo_secundario\\...`). While common in legitimate scripts, the volume and distribution of file operations (e.g., `StartupProfileData`, `Temp`) may indicate automated or obfuscated processes.\n   - **Path Checks:** Repeated use of `Test-Path` to validate file existence (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`) suggests conditional logic, potentially part of a script or payload delivery mechanism.\n\n2. **System Component Interaction:**\n   - **Legitimate DLLs:** Image loads (e.g., `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender, `.NET` runtime components) are typical for system processes but could be exploited in malicious contexts (e.g., DLL hijacking).\n\n3. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events correlate with PowerShell command execution, possibly indicating script-based automation or persistent mechanisms.\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The use of nested directory structures (e.g., `modulo_secundario\\..\\\\tarefa_base\\...`) may obscure malicious activity.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The repetitive `Test-Path` checks without clear operational context (e.g., no subsequent file manipulation or network activity) raise questions about intent.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **not definitively malicious**, the combination of PowerShell-driven file operations, registry changes, and repetitive path checks suggests **potential for further investigation**. This could include:\n- Correlating with network logs for data exfiltration or C2 communication.\n- Checking for anomalous user behavior or privilege escalation.\n- Analyzing the scripts (e.g., `estrutura_principal_script.bat`) for obfuscation or hidden payloads.\n\n**Classification:** **Interesting** ( warranting deeper analysis but not conclusive evidence of compromise)."}

So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is running scripts that check if certain files exist. The command lines have a pattern: they use Test-Path to check for a specific .bat file in various directories, then exit 0 or 1 based on that. The paths mentioned are all over the place, like C:\\modulo_geral, C:\\tarefa_logico, etc. These paths don't look standard, which might be a red flag.\n\nThen there are some file creation and deletion events. For example, a temporary PowerShell script is created and then deleted. That's common in normal operations, but when combined with other activities, it might be part of something malicious. Also, there's a mention of winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The file creation there is in the Downloads directory, which is normal, but not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the registry events and process accesses, nothing immediately stands out. The Windows Defender DLLs being loaded are normal system processes. However, the repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific .bat files in non-standard paths could indicate that someone is trying to see if certain scripts are present, possibly as part of a payload or a check for a backdoor.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple instances of these Test-Path commands in different directories might suggest that the attacker is probing the system for specific files, which could be part of an exploitation chain. If those .bat files are not present, the scripts exit with 1, which might be a way to determine if the system is vulnerable or if certain conditions are met.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, connecting to external IPs, or executing harmful commands. The events are mostly passive checks and temporary file operations. Without more context, like network activity or actual execution of malicious code, it's hard to confirm, but the pattern of checking for specific files in non-standard paths is suspicious.\n\nSo, considering all this, the batch might be worth investigating further. The repeated PowerShell checks could be part of a larger attack, but on their own, they might not be conclusive. Therefore, the answer would be that it's somewhat suspicious and merits further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided batch of events shows a pattern of activity that warrants further investigation, though no definitive malicious behavior is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Script Checks:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `.bat` files in non-standard, seemingly arbitrary directories (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral`, `C:\\pacote_principal`, etc.). \n   - The scripts exit with `0` (success) or `1` (failure) based on whether the file exists. This could indicate:\n     - **Probing for specific files** (e.g., checking for the presence of payloads, backdoors, or exploit components).\n     - **Conditional execution logic** (e.g., triggering further actions if certain files are found).\n\n2. **Temporary File Operations:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`entrada_base.exe`, `tarefa_ativo.exe`, etc.) is created and deleted (`file creation\/deletion events`). While common in benign scenarios (e.g., temporary script execution), this could also be a tactic to **avoid leaving persistent traces**.\n\n3. **Lack of Direct Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No events show actual execution of malicious payloads, network connections, or privilege escalation.\n   - Windows Defender-related DLLs (`entrada_base.exe`, `tarefa_ativo.exe`) are loaded, which are part of standard system processes.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - A file creation event involving `winlogbeat` (a log shipper) in the `Downloads` directory is noted. This is likely benign but could be a red herring if the attacker is trying to blend in with normal log-shipping activity.\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- The **repeated use of `Test-Path` in non-standard paths** suggests the attacker may be **scanning the file system** for specific files, possibly to determine if certain conditions (e.g., presence of a backdoor, vulnerable software) are met.\n- The **lack of clear malicious output** (e.g., network traffic, file modifications, process injections) makes it difficult to confirm intent, but the pattern is **consistent with reconnaissance**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **suspicious but inconclusive**. The repetitive PowerShell checks and file probing are not inherently malicious but could be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., pre-exploitation reconnaissance). Further investigation is recommended, including:\n- Correlating these events with **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections, DNS queries).\n- Checking for **unauthorized file modifications** or **unusual process behavior**.\n- Reviewing **system logs** for signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for further analysis** — the pattern of activity is not definitively malicious but raises enough red flags to warrant deeper investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's a PowerShell process checking if a certain file exists. The command line is using Test-Path to check for a file in \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe\". If it exists, exit 0, else 1. This seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script that's verifying dependencies. But then again, sometimes attackers use similar checks to see if certain files are present before proceeding.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Process Access events for PowerShell. That's common, but not necessarily suspicious. Then there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them is normal when running PowerShell scripts that use .NET. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be a red flag. Why would PowerShell be loading Defender DLLs? That seems unusual. Maybe a legitimate process, but could also be a sign of something trying to interact with Defender, perhaps to disable it or bypass it.\n\nThen there's a File Created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script policy test file. Creating and deleting a temporary file is common, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe it's an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving traces. However, the fact that it's a test file might be benign, like part of a script's self-check.\n\nThe next events involve checking paths like \"C:\\registro_principal...\" and \"C:\\objeto_auxiliar...\", similar to the first event. These might be checking for specific executables. If these files don't exist, the scripts exit with 1. But why would an attacker check for these files? Maybe they're looking for a specific payload or determining the environment.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own. Then a cmd.exe process checking if a file exists in the temp directory. Again, similar to the PowerShell checks. This might be part of a legitimate script, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it's worth noting.\n\nThe Registry value set events could indicate changes to the system, but without knowing what's being set, it's hard to tell. If they're modifying keys related to execution policies or startup scripts, that's more concerning.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell processes checking for files, loading .NET and Defender DLLs, creating and deleting temp files, and registry changes. While some of these could be part of normal operations, the combination might suggest an attempt to probe the system, possibly for reconnaissance or to check for the presence of certain tools or configurations. The loading of Defender DLLs is particularly odd and might warrant further investigation. However, without more context or additional suspicious activities (like network connections to malicious IPs, unexpected execution of payloads, etc.), it's hard to confirm malicious intent. But given the repetitive checks and the unusual DLL loading, this batch could be considered interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Behavior**:\n   - **File existence checks**: Multiple PowerShell processes use `Test-Path` to verify the presence of files in paths like `C:\\registro_ativo\\...` and `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`. These checks could be part of **dependency validation** or **environment reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for specific executables or payloads).\n   - **Temporary file creation\/deletion**: A temporary PowerShell script policy file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted. While common in benign scenarios, this could also be part of **obfuscation** or **self-deleting malware**.\n\n2. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs**: PowerShell processes load `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (components of Windows Defender). This is **unusual** and may indicate an attempt to **interact with or bypass antivirus** mechanisms (e.g., checking for detection, modifying behavior, or disabling Defender).\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple **Registry value set** events are logged. Without specific context, these could represent **legitimate configuration changes** or **malicious persistence** (e.g., altering execution policies, adding startup entries).\n\n4. **cmd.exe and whoami.exe**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process checks for the existence of a file in the temp directory (`objeto_logico.txt`), and a `whoami.exe` process is executed. These are **common utilities** but could be part of **scripting workflows** or **user enumeration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns**\n- **Repetitive File Checks**: The repeated use of `Test-Path` across different paths may indicate **environment probing** (e.g., checking for the presence of tools, payloads, or system configurations).\n- **Defender DLL Loading**: Loading Defender DLLs from PowerShell is **highly unusual** and could suggest **antivirus evasion techniques** or **exploitation of Defender's APIs**.\n- **Registry Changes**: While not inherently malicious, the lack of context for these changes raises concerns about **persistence mechanisms** or **execution policy modifications**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Explanations**\n- **Scripting\/Development**: The file checks and temporary file creation could be part of **legitimate scripts** validating dependencies or testing configurations.\n- **System Updates\/Tools**: Registry changes might be related to **software updates** or **tool installations**.\n- **Defender Integration**: Loading Defender DLLs might be part of **legitimate security tools** interacting with the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Data**:\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Investigate **file hashes** of any created\/deleted files for malware signatures.\n   - Review **full command-line arguments** and **parent processes** for PowerShell\/cmd.exe.\n\n2. **Analyze Registry Changes**:\n   - Identify which keys were modified and their purpose (e.g., execution policies, startup scripts).\n\n3. **Monitor Defender Behavior**:\n   - Check Windows Defender logs for **unusual activity** (e.g., blocked processes, real-time protection alerts).\n\n4. **Check for Persistence**:\n   - Look for **scheduled tasks**, **registry run keys**, or **service modifications** that could indicate persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but the **combination of PowerShell probing, unusual DLL loading, and registry changes** raises **moderate suspicion**. Further investigation into **network behavior, file content, and user context** is required to determine if this represents **legitimate activity** or **malicious reconnaissance**."}

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with \"powershell.exe\" being accessed or created. That's common, but the frequency might be a red flag. Then, there are some \"Process Create\" events with specific command lines. Those command lines involve checking if certain files exist, like \"estrutura_temporario.cs\" or \"unidade_principal.cs\". The paths mentioned are all in different directories, which might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nWait, the command lines are using Test-Path to check for the existence of specific .cs files. If these files are not found, the process exits with 1. But why would an attacker do that? Maybe they're probing the system to see if certain files exist, which could indicate if their payload is already present or if they need to deploy something else. That sounds like reconnaissance.\n\nAlso, there are several \"Image loaded\" events with .dll files from the .NET Framework. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is normal for PowerShell, but the repeated loading might be part of executing .NET code, which could be used for malicious purposes. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother thing is the \"Registry value set\" event with cmd.exe. That's less common and might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. But again, alone it's not conclusive.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell processes checking for specific files and the loading of .NET assemblies might be part of a larger attack. The fact that multiple command lines are checking different paths could be an attempt to locate specific files or directories, possibly to determine the environment or to find where to inject code. However, without more suspicious activities like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or unexpected network activity, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut considering the number of events and the pattern of checking for specific files, this might be a legitimate script, but the frequency and the use of PowerShell for such checks could be suspicious. The classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events suggests potential reconnaissance or setup activities that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential reconnaissance or setup activities. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple `Process Create` events involve PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of specific `.cs` files (e.g., `estrutura_temporario.cs`, `unidade_principal.cs`) using `Test-Path`. \n   - These checks are structured to exit with `0` or `1` based on file presence, potentially probing the system for specific files or directories. This could indicate:\n     - **Reconnaissance:** Probing for the presence of files to determine system configuration, deployment status, or potential targets.\n     - **Conditional Execution:** Preparing for subsequent actions based on file existence (e.g., deploying payloads if files are absent).\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths:**\n   - The `.cs` files referenced (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\estrutura_base\\src\\unidade_secundario.cs`) use non-standard, deeply nested paths. This may suggest:\n     - **Custom or Malicious File Structures:** The use of arbitrary paths could be an attempt to evade detection or mimic legitimate software directories.\n\n3. **.NET Assembly Loading:**\n   - Multiple `Image Loaded` events involve `.dll` files from the .NET Framework (e.g., `clrjit.dll`, `mscoree.dll`). While normal for PowerShell, the **repeated loading** of these assemblies might indicate:\n     - **Execution of .NET Code:** Leveraging PowerShell to run compiled .NET payloads (e.g., for obfuscation or advanced persistence).\n\n4. **Registry Modification:**\n   - A `Registry value set` event involving `cmd.exe` is unusual and could hint at **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying registry keys to ensure reexecution of malicious code).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- **Pattern of Behavior:** The combination of file existence checks, .NET assembly loading, and registry modifications suggests a **multi-stage attack** or **setup phase** (e.g., initial reconnaissance, followed by payload deployment).\n- **Lack of Obvious Malice:** While no direct exfiltration or exploitation is evident, the **frequency and structure of the commands** raise suspicion, especially if these activities are uncharacteristic of the system's normal behavior.\n- **Potential for Evasion:** The use of legitimate tools (PowerShell, .NET) and non-standard file paths may be an attempt to **blend in with normal operations**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for associated network activity, user behavior, or other system events (e.g., unauthorized access, data transfers).\n- **Analyze File Contents:** Inspect the `.cs` files referenced to determine if they contain malicious code or are part of a legitimate application.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage:** Implement logging and alerts for unusual PowerShell commands or script execution patterns.\n- **Review Registry Changes:** Investigate the `Registry value set` event to determine its purpose and whether it aligns with legitimate system behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **suspicious but not definitively malicious**. The combination of PowerShell reconnaissance, .NET assembly loading, and registry modifications warrants **further investigation** to rule out adversarial activity. Labeling this as **\"INTERESTING\"** is appropriate due to the potential for hidden malicious intent."}

That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which is then deleted. That could be part of a script testing, but maybe not malicious. \n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Then some Engine Lifecycle events with command lines checking if certain files exist. The paths mentioned are all over the place, like C:\\estrutura_temporario and others. These paths seem random or maybe obfuscated. \n\nThen there are multiple entries where PowerShell is checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various directories. The name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" sounds suspicious because keystroke loggers are often used in malware. Even though the scripts are just checking if they exist, the repeated attempts across different paths might indicate an attacker trying to locate a malicious script. \n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process created, which is normal for checking user identity, but combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger attack.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. There are several ImageLoad events pointing to .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that might be normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is also a legitimate file. But then there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1), followed by a FileDelete event. That could be part of normal script testing, but the fact that it's created and then deleted might be suspicious if it's part of an attempt to execute and then clean up.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are a couple of PowerShell commands that check if a file exists (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and exit with 0 or 1. The filenames have paths like \"C:\\tarefa_temporario\\\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico\\\", which might be obfuscated or part of a larger malicious script. The presence of these paths and the fact that the script is checking for existence could be part of a larger attack, like checking if a malicious script is present before executing it.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent entries for PowerShell, which might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated. However, there's also a whoami.exe execution, which is a legitimate command to check user context, and notepad.exe and calc.exe with ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer and used for URL handling. These might be benign.\n\nBut the key points here are the PowerShell script creation and deletion, the repeated ImageLoad events for .NET components, and the command lines that check for specific scripts. While some of these could be normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to run a script that's being hidden or is part of a larger malicious activity. The presence of multiple PowerShell events with registry and file operations might be more than just normal user activity. However, without seeing the actual content of the scripts or more context, it's a bit tricky.

This could indicate **preparation for lateral movement** or **credential harvesting** (e.g., `Get-Keystrokes` is a known tool for stealing credentials).\n\n2. **ImageLoad Events:**\n   - Multiple legitimate .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded, which is normal for PowerShell execution. However, the **repetition of `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` entries** for PowerShell suggests **increased monitoring** or **tampering** with the process.\n\n3. **Suspicious Paths:**\n   - The paths `C:\\tarefa_temporario\\` and `C:\\unidade_logor\\` are **non-standard** and may be **obfuscated** to evade detection. This is a red flag for **malicious activity**.\n\n4. **Other Processes:**\n   - **`whoami.exe`** and **`calc.exe`** are legitimate, but **`notepad.exe`** and **`svchost.exe`** with `RegistryEvent` entries could indicate **registry modification** (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** **High**  \n  The combination of script creation\/deletion, obfuscated paths, and repeated PowerShell\/registry interactions suggests **potential post-exploitation behavior** (e.g., credential dumping, lateral movement).\n- **Confidence Level:** **Moderate to High**  \n  While some entries (e.g., .NET DLLs) are benign, the **pattern of suspicious file operations and obfuscation** warrants further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Deleted Script:**  \n   Check if the deleted PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) was temporarily stored in memory or on disk for analysis.\n2. **Audit Registry Changes:**  \n   Examine registry modifications linked to `svchost.exe` and `notepad.exe` for persistence mechanisms (e.g., startup entries, scheduled tasks).\n3. **Monitor for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**  \n   Verify if the referenced script exists on the system and analyze its contents for malicious payloads.\n4. **Correlate with Network Traffic:**  \n   Look for **C2 communication** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains) around the time of these events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries **require further investigation** due to the **suspicious file operations, obfuscated paths, and PowerShell activity**.

The whoami.exe executions are standard for checking user context, but the repeated access to powershell.exe could be suspicious. \n\nLooking at the network connections, chrome.exe has multiple network connects and DNS queries. That's typical for browsing, but maybe if there's unusual activity. However, the main thing here is the powershell.exe events.
