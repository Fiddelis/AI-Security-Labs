This process appears to be related to Windows Update.\n* The same process terminated at 10:39:05 (UTC).\n* Another instance of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was created at 10:40:14 (UTC) and terminated shortly after.\n\n**File System Events**\n\n* A file named `WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.etl` was created in the `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate` directory.\n* Another instance of this file was created at 10:41:24 (UTC).\n\n**Process Interactions**\n\n* The process `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` accessed various files and registry entries, including its own executable and DLLs.\n\n**Network Activity**\n\n* There is no indication of network activity in the log.\n\n**Other Events**\n\n* A new instance of `powershell.exe` was created at 10:41:43 (UTC).\n* The process `winlogbeat.exe` was created at 10:42:01 (UTC) and appears to be collecting logs from various sources on the system.\n\nIf you'd like me to extract any specific information or provide further analysis, feel free to let me know!"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log file from an Elasticsearch Beats agent, specifically Winlogbeat, which is collecting Windows event logs and other system information. Here's a breakdown of the events:\n\n**Events**\n\nThere are multiple events in this log, but I'll highlight some interesting ones:\n\n1. **File created**: This event type indicates that a new file was created on the system.\n2. **Process Create**: This event type indicates that a new process was created on the system.\n3. **Registry value set**: This event type indicates that a registry value was modified on the system.\n\n**Notable events**\n\n1. A new `notepad.exe` process was created (event 5).\n2. A file named `MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` was downloaded and installed in the `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate` directory (events 6 and 7).\n3. The same file was then executed, creating a new process named `setup.exe` (event 8).\n\n**Security implications**\n\nThese events suggest that there might be some malicious activity on the system:\n\n1. The creation of multiple files with similar names (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`) could indicate a malware infection or a download of malicious software.\n2. The execution of the `setup.exe` process, which is not a standard Windows executable, raises suspicions.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n1. Review the system's event logs to see if there are any other suspicious events related to these processes and files.\n2. Use anti-virus software or tools like SysInternals to analyze the executed binaries and determine their behavior.\n3. Verify that the `setup.exe` process is legitimate and not a malicious file.\n\nKeep in mind that this analysis is based solely on the provided log data, and further investigation may be necessary to fully understand the situation."}
