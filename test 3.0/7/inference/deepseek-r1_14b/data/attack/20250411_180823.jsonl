{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome is a browser that handles many connections and DNS lookups. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, RuntimeBroker.exe setting registry values—Runtime Broker often interacts with the registry for Windows functions, so that's expected and not unusual.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe also accessing registry values. Notepad isn't typically associated with malicious activity, but it can sometimes be used in attacks if executed with certain parameters or scripts. However, without more context, this might just be a legitimate use of the app.\n\nI notice powershell.exe showing up multiple times—both as process accesses and creating new tasks. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and script-based attacks. The presence here could be suspicious, but it's also commonly used legitimately by admins for system management. I need to check if there are any unusual commands or arguments.\n\nCalc.exe being run and loading urlmon.dll sounds odd. Normally, calc.exe is benign, but if it's loading a DLL like urlmon, maybe it's doing something more than just calculations. This could be an attempt to inject malicious code or part of a payload delivery.\n\nLooking at cmd.exe, there are command lines that create scheduled tasks using schtasks. The tasks created under onlogon and onstart events with commands running calc.exe as system might be red flags. Creating tasks that run on startup or logon as system can indicate persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access to the system.\n\nAdditionally, multiple calls from svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files in the Tasks directory are concerning. SvcHost is a generic host process for services; if it's making many changes without reason, it could be a sign of malicious activity. The creation of specific task files like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" seems custom and not part of standard system operations.\n\nAnother cmd.exe instance creating tasks that execute calc.exe again adds to the suspicion. Combining multiple instances of scheduled tasks executing calc.exe at different triggers (on startup, logon) points towards potential persistence or a way to escalate privileges if calc.exe is doing more than just calculations.\n\nThere are also entries from conhost.exe accessing the registry. ConHost is often used in command-line environments, but again, without context on what commands it's running, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple processes (cmd.exe, schtasks.exe) creating scheduled tasks that run calc.exe as system; svchost.exe making numerous registry changes and file creations in the Task directory; powershell.exe instances with no clear legitimate reason. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence on the system.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as INTERESTING due to the combination of these events, which may indicate a coordinated attack attempting to maintain presence on the network.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes with Elevated Privileges:**\n   - Multiple `cmd.exe` instances are creating scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe` with parameters `\/ru system`. This allows commands to run under the system account, a common tactic for persistence and privilege escalation.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Creation:**\n   - Tasks created include `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`, `pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup`, etc., which are non-standard names. These tasks execute `calc.exe`, potentially to run malicious scripts or payload after system startup.\n\n3. **svchost.exe Activity:**\n   - Several instances of `svchost.exe` setting registry values and creating files in the Task directory (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks`). This activity is unusual for a process typically involved in running Windows services, suggesting possible injection of malicious code or service creation.\n\n4. **PowerShell Usage Without Legitimate Context:**\n   - Powershell being invoked multiple times without clear administrative justification raises suspicion. It's often used by attackers for script execution and lateral movement within networks.\n\n5. **Benign Programs with Suspicious Actions:**\n   - Tools like `calc.exe` and `notepad.exe` are commonly used maliciously if executed with specific parameters or scripts, despite being standard applications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe log events indicate potential malicious activities aimed at establishing persistence on the system. The combination of scheduled task creation under the system account, unusual registry modifications by `svchost.exe`, and suspicious use of PowerShell suggest a possible attack. Therefore, this batch is classified as INTERESTING for further investigation.\n\n**Answer:**  \n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"INTERESTING\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Multiple instances of scheduled tasks created by cmd.exe and schtasks.exe executing calc.exe under system privileges, combined with unusual svchost.exe registry modifications and potential PowerShell misuse.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and especially chrome.exe are making registry changes. Registry value sets can be common activities, but when many different processes do this, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThere's also a powershell.exe process accessing another process and creating files. Creating files with specific names like 'unidade_ativo.txt' could be part of malicious activity, such as storing data for later exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, the use of whoami.exe is notable because it can be used to gather system information, which attackers might do to understand the environment before acting. Powershell's ProcessAccess events suggest potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe high frequency of registry changes from chrome.exe stands out. While legitimate software does modify the registry, an unusual number of such events could signal an attempt to hide traces or establish persistence after a breach.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—the varied processes modifying the registry, file creations that might be part of malicious activities, and the use of tools like whoami and powershell—it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting. However, without more context or evidence of direct malicious behavior, my confidence is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes, including chrome.exe and powershell.exe, show repeated registry modifications and file creations that could indicate suspicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
