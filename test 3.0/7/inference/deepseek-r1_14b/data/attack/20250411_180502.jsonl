{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That's pretty normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity for browsing. Nothing too suspicious there on its own.\n\nThen I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious, so that catches my attention. The first entry shows a Registry value set by PowerShell. That could be setting up persistence or configuration changes, which is often part of malware behavior. \n\nLooking further, there's a process create event for PowerShell with a command line that starts another process to run a .bat file. The path in the command line seems suspicious—using \"..\\\" might indicate trying to access parent directories, possibly to reach files outside the current scope. This could be an attempt to execute scripts from unexpected locations.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created and then immediately deleted by PowerShell. That's concerning because it suggests something is trying to create temporary files and then remove them quickly, maybe to avoid detection or to drop malicious payloads temporarily.\n\nThere are several Image Load events in the logs. This means that certain DLLs are being loaded into memory. The specific paths mentioned include system directories like Microsoft.NET and Windows assemblies, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers use these legitimate locations to hide their activities.\n\nI also see multiple Pipe Created events. PowerShell often creates pipes for communication between processes. While this is common, an unusual number of pipes could indicate something malicious, especially if combined with other suspicious actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks related to PowerShell. These might be part of the script execution process but again, when coupled with the other events, it raises red flags.\n\nThe last event involves ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a Registry value, which could be related to Windows system processes but doesn't add much to the suspicion unless there's more context.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated use of PowerShell with unusual command-line arguments, file creation\/deletion, and multiple registry changes are indicators that could point towards malicious activity. The attempts to execute scripts from various paths and the hidden process creations make me think of possible script-based attacks or persistence mechanisms. While it's not conclusive proof, the combination is significant enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell, including Registry modifications and file creation\/deletion, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"EVENTS_OF_INTEREST\": [\n    {\n      \"PROCESS\": \"powershell.exe\",\n      \"TASK\": \"Registry value set\",\n      \"COMMENT\": \"Potential persistence mechanism.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"PROCESS\": \"powershell.exe\",\n      \"TASK\": \"File creation and deletion\",\n      \"COMMENT\": \"Indicates possible script execution or payload dropping.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"PROCESS\": \"powershell.exe\",\n      \"COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS\": \"...C:\\\\componente_secundario\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\registro_temporario\\\\unidade_principal_script.bat...\",\n      \"COMMENT\": \"Suspicious file path navigation and script execution.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Notably, powershell.exe appears several times with tasks like Registry value set, Image loaded, and File created. This stands out because PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement and executing malicious scripts.\n\nI see that one of the PowerShell processes was started via a command line argument pointing to a .bat file in \"C:\\estrutura_logico\\registro_temporario..entrada_comum\\Componente_padrao_script.bat\". The path seems suspicious with multiple dots and backslashes, which might indicate an attempt to hide the true location or obfuscate the script's origin.\n\nAnother PowerShell instance created a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\Componente_principal.txt\". Creating files in user directories could be part of data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, there are several registry modifications (Registry value set) across different processes, which is concerning because attackers often modify the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThe fact that multiple processes like chrome.exe and cmd.exe are also performing registry writes might indicate legitimate activity, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it raises suspicion. Furthermore, svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory could be part of normal operations, but sometimes malware uses svchost for persistence or to execute malicious code.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and sequence, there's a pattern where multiple processes are writing to the registry and files, which might not be typical user activity. The combination of these events—suspicious file creations by PowerShell, command-line arguments pointing to scripts in unusual paths, and repeated registry modifications—suggests potential malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities, especially those involving PowerShell and multiple registry writes, could indicate a breach or attack. However, there's some uncertainty because some of these actions might be part of legitimate system operations, though in combination, they seem more concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating suspicious activity, including PowerShell process creations with potential malicious command-line arguments and file writes. The repeated registry modifications and file creations across different processes raise concerns about possible unauthorized system changes or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, all of them are from 'chrome.exe' and involve a registry value being set. That seems a bit unusual because Chrome itself doesn't typically make changes to the registry in real-time unless there's an update or some extension activity. But seeing multiple instances might be normal if Chrome is doing some background updates.\n\nThen, towards the end of the log batch, I see two more events. One is from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its own directory, which makes sense because that's likely part of how it operates or sets up configurations. The other event is from 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'elemento_base.txt'. PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be a red flag if it's executing scripts without user interaction.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows multiple registry writes by Chrome and some file operations by legitimate system tools. While unusual in number, there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The only slightly concerning part is the PowerShell creating an arbitrary file, but without more context or additional suspicious events, it might just be a script running as part of normal operations.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because, while multiple registry writes and file creations can sometimes indicate malicious behavior, there's not enough evidence here to suggest anything harmful. The confidence is low because there are some red flags but nothing concrete.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events of 'Registry value set' by chrome.exe and legitimate file creation activities, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
