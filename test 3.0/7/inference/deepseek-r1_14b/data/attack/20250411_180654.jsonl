{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. So, I have a JSONL file with multiple events, each representing some activity on the system.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: there's a lot of `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be a red flag. The `whoami.exe` process also shows up once; while it's usually benign, in some contexts it might be part of privilege escalation.\n\nNext, examining the winlog tasks: there are events related to file creation, process access, registry value sets, image loading, and provider lifecycle. Registry modifications can indicate malicious activity because attackers often alter system configurations. The repeated `RegistryEvent` from Chrome is suspiciousâ€”why would Chrome be making so many changes? That could be a sign of tampering or malware.\n\nLooking at the files involved: one file named `objeto_temporario.txt` was created, and there are several PowerShell commands invoking scripts with paths that include \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This script name suggests it's designed to log keystrokes, which is definitely malicious behavior. The fact that these scripts are being run from different paths like `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads` or within various project folders indicates possible distribution of malicious code.\n\nAlso, the command lines for PowerShell show they're executing scripts with parameters pointing to temporary locations for logs. This kind of activity is typical for keyloggers or other surveillance malware, which is a serious security concern.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially harmful scripts, registry modifications, file creation, and repeated provider lifecycle events suggest a coordinated attack. The repetitive nature of the `chrome.exe` activities might be part of a larger campaign to establish persistence or spread across systems.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows clear signs of malicious activity that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts with parameters pointing to temporary log paths and repeated registry modifications. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior such as keylogging or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve powershell.exe. That's not unusual on its own because PowerShell is a common tool, but sometimes malicious actors use it for scripting. Looking closer, two of the events have command lines executing scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that these scripts are trying to log keystrokes raises a red flag because keyloggers are often used maliciously to capture sensitive information.\n\nNext, there are several file operations: creating and deleting files in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\*. These actions could be part of a script's normal operation, but combined with the keylogging scripts, it might indicate that the script is storing data temporarily before exfiltration.\n\nAlso, there are registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to stick around after reboots, which is a common tactic for attackers.\n\nAdditionally, I see some legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files, and svchost.exe creating state files. These might just be normal system activities, but they don't stand out as suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running scripts with potentially malicious purposes (keylogging), coupled with file creation\/deletion in temp directories and registry modifications, suggests possible malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because these activities align with known attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), creating and deleting files in temporary directories, and registry modifications suggest possible malicious activity such as keylogging or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
