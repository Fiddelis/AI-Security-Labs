{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is being accessed and created. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access could be a red flag. The command lines don't show any obvious malicious commands, but the frequency might warrant closer look.\n\nNext, I notice several instances of cmd.exe and sc.exe being used to create services. For example, \"sc create win32times binPath=...\" looks suspicious because it's creating a service that runs a script from a non-existing path (c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1). This could indicate an attempt to set up a persistent backdoor or malicious activity.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value sets by various processes like services.exe, svchost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe. While these can be part of normal operations, the sheer number and combination with other events might suggest tampering with system configurations, which could be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry where Calculator.exe is loading urlmon.dll, which is unusual for a simple calculator app. This could indicate that the process is being used as a vector for something more nefarious.\n\nFinally, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user directory might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it's worth noting if this is part of log monitoring or potentially data exfiltration.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple PowerShell accesses, creation of services with suspicious paths, registry modifications, and an unusual DLL load suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high because several red flags are present together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creations and Registry events involving potentially malicious activities such as creating services with suspicious paths and repeated use of PowerShell.exe, which could indicate an attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set\". This means Chrome is making changes to the Windows registry. It's normal for applications to modify the registry when they run or update settings, so I'm not sure if this alone is suspicious. But seeing it repeated 7 times might be worth looking into—is there a reason Chrome would change the registry multiple times in quick succession?\n\nThen, another chrome.exe event shows an image load from C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll. AMI could stand for something related to security—maybe Anti-Malware. Wait, I think AMSI stands for Antimalware Scan Interface. So loading that might be normal as part of Windows' own protection mechanisms. But sometimes attackers disable or manipulate these components, so maybe this event is a red flag.\n\nNext, there's an image load from C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... MpOAV.dll. This seems like it's related to Microsoft Defender, which is legitimate software. So loading that should be normal.\n\nThen, the last entry is powershell.exe accessed via ProcessAccess. Powershell is often used by administrators but can also be a tool for attackers because of its scripting capabilities. A process access event might indicate someone trying to interact with another process, possibly maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated registry changes from Chrome could be normal or could indicate something like tampering. The loading of defender-related DLLs seems okay. But the powershell.exe interaction stands out—attackers often use Powershell for executing commands and lateral movement. So this batch has a mix but especially the powershell event raises an eyebrow.\n\nI'm leaning towards it being interesting because while some events might be normal, others (like powershell) could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe and a process access event involving PowerShell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
