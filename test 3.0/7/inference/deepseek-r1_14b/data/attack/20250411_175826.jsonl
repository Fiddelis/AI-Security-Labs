{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. While Chrome does make many legitimate network calls, the repeated NetworkConnect tasks might be worth looking into, especially if they're unusual in volume or destination.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The command lines show some complex operations involving file paths with encoded text, like \"modulo_logico\" and \"estrutura_secundario\". This could be an attempt to hide the true purpose of the script or modify timestamps on files, which might indicate tampering with logs.\n\nLooking closer at one powershell.exe process, the command line has a script that iterates over file objects and sets their LastWriteTime to 1970. This is a classic technique used in malware to make files appear older than they are, possibly evading detection by security tools that look for recently modified files.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted. The FileCreate followed by FileDeleteDetected could be part of a cleanup process or an attempt to remove evidence after performing some malicious activity. This behavior is suspicious because legitimate processes usually don't need to delete temporary files so quickly unless they're running into issues.\n\nAnother point is the use of RegistryEvent tasks in multiple processes, including powershell.exe and notepad.exe. While applications can modify the registry for legitimate reasons, repeated writes could be a sign of persistence mechanisms being set up. Malware often uses the registry to ensure it runs on startup or maintains long-term presence on a system.\n\nI also see that some events have 'Provider Lifecycle' as their task type. This might relate to how certain services or drivers are being loaded or unloaded, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is normal or not.\n\nOverall, the combination of powershell.exe with unusual command-line arguments, file timestamp modifications, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry activity stands out as concerning. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, log tampering, or establishing persistence on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines attempting to modify file timestamps and delete temporary files, along with registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell commands running. The command lines look like they're modifying file timestamps using Get-ChildItem and setting LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970\". That date seems suspicious because it's often used in malware to make files appear older or as system files.\n\nLooking at the tasks, most are either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These don't immediately ring alarm bells, but combined with the PowerShell command lines, they might indicate some script execution. \n\nThere are events where svchost.exe and conhost.exe set registry values. Svchost is a common process, so alone it's not suspicious, but multiple registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nI see Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. While unusual, sometimes legitimate apps load extra DLLs. But combined with other indicators, it might warrant closer look.\n\nThen there are multiple Chrome processes setting registry values. This is a bit odd because Chrome doesn't typically do that much in the Registry. Malware often uses registry keys for persistence or configuration.\n\nAlso, winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems normal if it's part of log management, but I should consider if this process was running unexpectedly.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances modifying files' timestamps, several svchost and Chrome processes making unexpected Registry changes, and some other anomalies like Calculator loading urlmon. These could be signs of malicious activity trying to hide or establish persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of events suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell commands attempting to modify file timestamps, which may indicate an attempt to hide file activity. Additionally, there are several instances of svchost.exe and other processes making Registry changes, which could be signs of malicious behavior or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm supposed to analyze them as a whole and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows that 'chrome.exe' set a registry value. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings. The file field is None here, so no file activity.\n\nNext, there's an event where all fields are None. I'm not sure why this is included, but maybe it's just noise or a placeholder.\n\nLooking at the third and fourth events again, 'chrome.exe' sets registry values and loads files like 'amsi.dll', which is related to antivirus scans. That seems normal too—browsers often load system libraries.\n\nThe fifth event shows Chrome loading another file from Windows Defender. Again, this is standard behavior since Defender's components can be loaded by various processes.\n\nThen there are multiple events repeating the same actions: 'chrome.exe' setting registry values and no files involved. This repetition could be part of Chrome's regular operation, maybe during a session or update.\n\nThe seventh event is from 'winlogbeat.exe', which I know is used for log management. It created a file in the user's directory. Not unusual; likely just saving configuration.\n\nThe eighth event is 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'unidade_logico.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this might be worth looking into. Creating a file could be part of script execution or data collection.\n\nAfter that, the ninth to fourteenth events all show Chrome setting registry values repeatedly. This repetition stands out because doing the same registry operation many times in a short period might indicate something suspicious, like an attempt to set persistence or manipulate system settings beyond normal usage.\n\nPutting it all together: most of these events are normal except for the PowerShell file creation and the repeated Chrome registry writes. The repeated actions by Chrome could be concerning—they might be part of an automated process trying to alter system configurations multiple times, which isn't typical user behavior. Additionally, the file created by PowerShell doesn't provide enough context to rule out malicious intent.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch has some elements that raise flags, making it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and file creation by powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
