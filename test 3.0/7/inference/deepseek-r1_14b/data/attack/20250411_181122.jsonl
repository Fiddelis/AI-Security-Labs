{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is the process creation of whoami.exe. That seems normal as it's a standard tool used to display user information. Nothing malicious here.\n\nNext, there are several events related to powershell.exe. The command line shows some PowerShell commands searching for files containing \"pass\" in .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls extensions. This could be a red flag because such searches often indicate data theft or espionage. Additionally, the process is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs, which can be common but sometimes used by malware.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe creates a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_...) and immediately deletes it. Such behavior is suspicious as attackers might delete their traces to avoid detection. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks with the same command line suggest multiple invocations of potentially malicious scripts.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new configuration file, which seems benign unless it's part of log tampering or misconfiguration.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing registry values might be normal for certain operations but could also be a vector for persistence if done inappropriately.\n\nFinally, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is standard behavior for some calculations and internet-related functions, so that's likely not concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious commands, file creation\/deletion, and potential registry modifications stand out. These activities could indicate malicious intent such as credential harvesting or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts searching for sensitive information in various files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's about 'powershell.exe' loading an image for MpClient.dll. That seems normal because PowerShell often loads system files. The second event has a command line with powershell.exe and findstr searching for password-related strings. This catches my attention because using findstr to search for sensitive information might indicate data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n\nThe third and fourth events are about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is commonly used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware. However, without more context on what registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. This seems normal; system files are often loaded by various processes. The fifth event is findstr.exe being called with similar search parameters as the second event. Again, this could be malicious if the intent is to gather sensitive data.\n\nThe sixth and seventh events involve powershell.exe accessing or creating files and registry entries. PowerShell is a common tool for attackers, so any non-standard use can be a red flag. The eighth event is OfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query. This might be normal but could also indicate communication with a malicious domain.\n\nContinuing on, there's another powershell.exe event creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That's concerning because it's a non-standard location and could be used for persistence or storing malicious data.\n\nThe events involving conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying registry values are tricky. These processes can be part of legitimate operations, but again, without knowing specifics, it's hard to judge. The Calculator.exe event setting a registry value is also something to note but likely benign unless it's an unusual key.\n\nMultiple events show chrome.exe making registry changes and DNS queries. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, frequent or unexpected modifications could be suspicious. However, given that there are many such events, it might just be normal browsing activity.\n\nThe last event is winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which is expected if the system is using WinlogBeat for log management. No issues here.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has several red flags: multiple powershell.exe instances with potentially malicious command lines searching for passwords, findstr.exe being used to search sensitive terms, and svchost.exe modifying registry entries without clear context. While some events are normal, the combination of these elements suggests possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell activities searching for sensitive information using findstr.exe, which may indicate potential data exfiltration or malicious behavior. Additionally, there are several registry modifications and file operations that could be suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's Chrome loading a DLL file from Windows Defender. That seems normal since Defender often updates its components. The next few events are all about Chrome making network connections. Multiple network connections from Chrome could be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe it's just regular browsing.\n\nThen there's an event where PowerShell creates a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. Creating files with such names might be part of script execution. Could be malicious or just a legitimate script. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, several events show Chrome setting registry values multiple times. That stands out because modifying the registry is a common tactic for persistence. If an attacker does this, they can ensure their malware runs at startup. But again, sometimes legitimate software does this too. Need to check how often and where these changes are happening.\n\nThere's also a DNS query event, which isn't unusual on its own but could be part of communication with external servers. Then, Winlogbeat creating files is expected since it's an agent that logs events, so that's probably normal.\n\nPowerShell creates another file named 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. Similar to the first file creation, this might indicate script activity. The fact that multiple files are being created by PowerShell could be a red flag if they're in unusual locations or have names that don't make sense.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. That's typically used to check user permissions and shouldn't be harmful on its own unless it's part of a larger sequence. The cmd.exe commands deleting scheduled tasks are interesting. Schtasks deletions can be part of removing persistence mechanisms. If these tasks were created by unknown processes, that could indicate malicious activity trying to clean up traces.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event modifying the registry and schtasks creating an ImageLoad event for taskschd.dll could be normal system operations or signs of process injection if done unexpectedly.\n\nConsidering all events together, there are several red flags: multiple registry modifications, file creations with unusual names by PowerShell, deletion of scheduled tasks via cmd and schtasks, which might be trying to remove persistence. These actions don't necessarily confirm malicious behavior but do suggest potential exploit activities.\n\nOn the other hand, some events could be legitimate system operations or user activity. Without more context on the environment and baseline behaviors, it's hard to be certain. However, the combination of registry changes, file creations by scripts, and task deletions leans towards being concerning enough for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events indicating potential malicious activities such as suspicious file creations, repeated registry modifications, and process deletions which may suggest persistence mechanisms or exploit attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system events in JSONL format to analyze. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is relevant for investigation. The output needs to be a single classification—either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\"—along with a justification and a confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through each event one by one to understand what's happening on the system. Let me go through them:\n\n1. **schtasks.exe**: The command line here is deleting a task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because it's removing a scheduled task without knowing its purpose. Maybe it's trying to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Image loaded by schtasks.exe** pointing to taskschd.dll—that's normal as part of the Task Scheduler, so not too concerning on its own.\n\n3. **svchost.exe** accessing the registry—it's known for hosting services, but if this is unexpected or combined with other events, it might be problematic.\n\n4. **cmd.exe** being used to delete a process (notepad.exe) via WMIC. This could indicate an attempt to terminate processes, possibly malicious ones.\n\n5. **powershell.exe** accessed multiple times—Powershell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities. Multiple accesses without clear reason might be suspicious.\n\n6. **whoami.exe**: Used here with a command line that looks standard, but repeated use could indicate privilege escalation attempts or information gathering.\n\n7. **WMIC.exe** being used to delete notepad.exe process again—another sign of possible process termination for hiding activities.\n\n8. WMIC loading various DLLs—it's normal but if combined with other events might show unusual behavior.\n\n9. **net user \/del**: Commands deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and others. Deleting user accounts is a high privilege operation and could indicate an attacker trying to clean up traces or remove access.\n\n10. **net1.exe** also used to delete another user. Unfamiliar command line utilities might be red flags, especially if they're deleting users.\n\nPutting it all together: The events show multiple instances of process deletions (notepad.exe, perhaps others), deletion of scheduled tasks, and removal of user accounts. These are all actions that could be part of a malicious activity chain, such as an attack where the perpetrator is trying to cover their tracks by removing logs or deleting accounts.\n\nThe repeated use of Powershell, cmd.exe with delete commands, and net\/WMIC for process termination suggests potential unauthorized access and system compromise. The deletion of user accounts might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or elevate privileges.\n\nI'm confident that these activities are unusual and could be signs of a security incident. However, I should consider if there's any normal scenario where such actions occur. For example, legitimate admin tasks might involve deleting old accounts or scheduled tasks, but the combination here, especially across different tools (cmd, Powershell, WMIC), makes it more suspicious.\n\nSo overall, this batch seems interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\n**Justification:** The system events indicate a series of potentially malicious activities, including process deletions, removal of scheduled tasks, and deletion of user accounts. These actions could be part of an attack chain aimed at covering tracks or elevating privileges.\n\n**Confidence Score: 85%**\n\nThe combination of tools (cmd.exe, Powershell, WMIC) used to perform deletions suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent, making this batch worthy of further investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if it's worth investigating. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where cmd.exe is being used with commands like deleting a user or service. For example, \"cmd.exe \/c net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". Deleting users from the domain might be part of legitimate admin tasks, but it's also something attackers could do to cover their tracks or escalate privileges.\n\nThen there's conhost.exe and powershell.exe showing up several times. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The fact that it's accessing processes multiple times could indicate script execution, which might be malicious if the scripts are doing something harmful.\n\nI notice \"whoami.exe\" being executed too. That usually just shows user info, but in some cases, it can be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThere are also events where services like 'win32times' are being deleted using sc.exe and cmd.exe. Deleting services might disrupt normal operations, which could be an attack vector if done without proper authorization.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, there's a lot of RegistryEvent activity. Modifying the registry can have serious implications, especially if it's changing security settings or persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nThe User Account Management and Security Group Management events are also recurring. These could indicate attempts to modify user accounts or group memberships, which is suspicious if not part of normal admin work.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple instances of process creation, registry modifications, user deletions, and service deletions across different tools like cmd, powershell, net.exe, sc.exe, etc. This pattern doesn't look entirely normal because a legitimate admin would probably use consistent tools and not have such varied activity. The combination suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at system compromise or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the events collectively show signs of possible unauthorized access or system tampering. However, I'm not entirely certain without more context, so my confidence is around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creations and registry modifications using various tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and net.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe. These are common tools but can be used maliciously. Looking at the first event, cmd.exe is deleting files in the Temp directory. That could be suspicious because attackers often clean up traces of their activities.\n\nThen there's a series of Registry value sets from both cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation, which are red flags.\n\nI also see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and files are being created or deleted. For example, in one event, a file named tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe is deleted by cmd.exe. This might indicate that malicious code was executed and then removed to avoid detection.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is run. This could be part of lateral movement or reconnaissance to check the current user context.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where powershell.exe is launched with \"& {}\" in the command line. This is a common technique to bypass certain security measures by appending commands that don't trigger parsing, which can execute arbitrary code.\n\nThe repeated use of these tools and the specific file operations make me think this activity could be part of a larger malicious process, like executing scripts or payload deployment.\n\nOverall, the combination of registry modifications, file deletions, powershell.exe usage with unusual command lines, and deletion of temporary files suggests potential malicious activity that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory, registry modifications, repeated powershell.exe executions with unusual command lines, and file deletions.

The user is asking me to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. They want just one classification and justification, along with a confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. All the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object. Let's start parsing them.\n\nThe first few entries involve 'powershell.exe' with tasks like Pipe Created, Engine Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, and Registry value set. That's normal because PowerShell often does these things during operation. Then there's a file path mentioned for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. So that's expected.\n\nNext, I see 'conhost.exe' creating a process, but it's associated with PowerShell, so again, not unusual unless it's being misused. Then there are several instances where 'whoami.exe' is executed. Whoami is a standard tool to check user information, often used by scripts or legitimate processes.\n\nI notice multiple entries of 'powershell.exe' accessing other processes and creating files. This repetition makes me think it's part of normal scripting rather than malicious activity. There are also events from 'winlogbeat.exe', which I recognize as an Elasticsearch log shipping tool. It's making changes to a YAML file, which is standard for configuration.\n\nLooking further, there are entries from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'svchost.exe'. Both of these are known legitimate processes on Windows, often related to system services or performance optimizations. Not seeing any red flags here.\n\nOther events include 'notepad.exe', 'calc.exe', and 'Calculator.exe' performing normal operations like loading images or creating files. These are common applications, so their activities don't raise alarms unless they're being used in an unusual way.\n\nI also see several entries where the task is 'Process Create' for various executables, which is a standard log entry when a new process starts. No indication of unauthorized processes here.\n\nThe confidence level: I'm about 0.9 confident because while there's repetitive behavior with PowerShell and other tools, nothing stands out as overtly malicious. It seems more like normal system operations or script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system operations such as process creation, file access, and registry changes, which are typical for Windows processes like PowerShell and legitimate tools.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's look at each event one by one.\n\nFirst up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so it's normal for it to create or update configuration files. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there are two powershell.exe entries with 'Process accessed' tasks. PowerShell is commonly used in scripts and can be malicious, but without more context like unusual commands or access times, these seem routine.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run. Whoami is a standard tool to check user information, often used by legitimate scripts or users to verify their permissions. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both set registry values. These are common system processes. The fact that they're modifying the registry doesn't raise alarms without additional indicators of compromise.\n\nChrome has multiple events: DNS queries and network connections. Chrome is a browser, so it's normal for it to make DNS requests and establish connections as part of browsing. No unusual activity here unless there's something specific about the sites visited, which isn't indicated.\n\nPutting it all together, none of these individual events are particularly concerning. They all fall within expected behavior for typical user activities and system processes. There's no pattern of multiple suspicious actions across different components or systems that would suggest a coordinated attack or malicious activity. Each event is isolated and doesn't point to any larger issue. Therefore, the batch isn't interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creation, file operations, registry changes, DNS queries, and network connections, all of which are typical and expected behavior for legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe.
