{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading system32 files like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are standard Windows components. I don't see any red flags here; it looks like legitimate process activity.\n\nNext, there are several events related to user account management with no associated processes or files. These might be routine logon\/logoff activities or system maintenance, so they're probably not concerning on their own.\n\nThen, I notice \"rundll32.exe\" being used with a command line that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. Rundll32 is commonly used for running DLL functions, but the presence of a specific GUID might be worth looking into. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\n\"svchost.exe\" modifying the registry isn't unusual since many services run under svchost. But the exact changes would need analysis to determine if they're legitimate or part of an exploit.\n\nThere are two entries from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating files in a known directory, which is expected behavior for log shipping tools like Winlogbeat. No issues here.\n\nExcel launching and loading various DLLs is standard for any application. The DNS query from Excel could be related to data fetching or external resources, which doesn't raise alarms unless the queried domain seems suspicious.\n\nLastly, \"WmiPrvSE.exe\" running with certain parameters and loading wmiutils.dll is normal for WMI-related processes. No signs of tampering here.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. Most actions are either standard system operations or legitimate application behavior. The only potentially interesting point is the use of rundll32.exe with a specific GUID, but without more data, it's not conclusive. Therefore, I classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system and application activities such as process creation, file operations, and registry modifications. No signs of malicious behavior are evident in the provided log entries.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events seem to be from Windows logs since the structure includes \"winlog\" tasks. The entries are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n- The process name is EXCEL.EXE.\n- The task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and the file path points to a .LNK file in the Office Recent folder.\n\nI know that .LNK files are shortcut files, so Excel creating them might be normal if it's saving recent documents. But seeing two identical events where the same file is being created by EXCEL.EXE could be suspicious. Maybe an attempt to create a file multiple times?\n\nThen there are some null entries with process and file as null, which probably aren't relevant.\n\nNext, there are three more events:\n- Process name is still EXCEL.EXE.\n- Task is \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\".\n- File is null again.\n\nSo Excel is making multiple DNS queries. That's interesting because Excel typically doesn't perform many DNS lookups on its own. Especially after creating a file, doing DNS queries could indicate that the application is trying to connect to external resources, possibly for data exfiltration or command and control communication.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Same process (Excel) performing multiple identical file creation events.\n- Followed by multiple DNS query attempts.\n\nThis pattern might suggest an attempt to create a malicious shortcut and then communicate with an external server. It's unusual behavior for Excel, so this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch shows Excel creating a file and making several DNS queries, which could indicate suspicious activity like malware using Excel for command and control communication.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Excel creating multiple files and performing DNS queries may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
