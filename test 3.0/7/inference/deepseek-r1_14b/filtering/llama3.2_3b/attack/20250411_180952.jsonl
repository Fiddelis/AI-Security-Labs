{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where command-line tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are being used with specific commands. For example, there's a process where cmd.exe is run with a command that adds a user to the domain and adds them to the Domain Admins group. This seems suspicious because such actions typically require administrative privileges and could be part of privilege escalation.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple net.exe and net1.exe processes adding users and groups. The usernames like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and \"modulo_comum_Admin\" stand out as they seem to follow a pattern, possibly indicating automated or scripted attacks. These activities might be part of an attempt to create backdoor accounts for future access.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of whoami.exe, which is often used to check user permissions and could be a precursor to more malicious actions. Additionally, svchost.exe being involved in creating files like SRUtmp.log isn't unusual on its own, but the fact that it's happening multiple times might indicate something amiss, especially if these logs are being manipulated.\n\nThere are also network-related events from chrome.exe making DNS queries and establishing connections. While this could be normal browsing activity, paired with other suspicious processes, it might hint at data exfiltration or communication with external servers.\n\nThe process involving winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file doesn't immediately raise alarms unless it's unexpected in the environment, but I'm not sure about that without more context.\n\nOverall, the combination of adding domain users and groups, using command-line tools for potential privilege escalation, and multiple instances of network activities makes this batch worth investigating. There are several indicators that could point to unauthorized access or malicious activity within the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes detected including cmd.exe adding users and groups, whoami.exe execution, and network connections from chrome.exe. These activities may indicate potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
