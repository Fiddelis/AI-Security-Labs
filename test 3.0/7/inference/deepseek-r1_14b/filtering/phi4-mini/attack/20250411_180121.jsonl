{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome is a web browser that makes such connections regularly. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, I see powershell.exe events starting to appear. PowerShell can be a red flag because it's often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. Looking deeper, some of these entries have command lines that download files from GitHub repositories. For example, the command line includes downloading LICENSE.txt files into the TEMP directory. This is concerning because downloading files from raw.githubusercontent.com might be part of an attempt to execute scripts or binaries.\n\nI notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is downloading different files with varying paths in TEMP directories. The fact that each download uses a unique file name like \"modulo_padrao.txt\", \"unidade_ativo.txt\", etc., suggests they're trying to avoid detection by using temporary files with random names. This behavior isn't typical for legitimate script execution, which might use more predictable naming conventions.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where the powershell.exe processes create files and delete them shortly after. The file creation is followed by a deletion, possibly an attempt to remove traces of their activity. For example, the \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1\" file is created and then deleted. This pattern could indicate that they're running scripts in a way that's meant to evade logging or detection mechanisms.\n\nThere are also events where PowerShell accesses other processes and sets registry values. While PowerShell does have legitimate uses, the combination of accessing other processes, downloading files from external sources, creating temporary files, and deleting them can be signs of malicious activity such as script injection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is that multiple different GitHub repositories are being accessed in these command lines. Each download comes from a slightly different path under various organizations like \"unidade_base\", \"entrada_temporario\", etc. This suggests a potential campaign where attackers are using different sources to distribute their payload, possibly trying to avoid IP reputation checks or blocklistings.\n\nThe variety of file names being downloaded—like \"modulo_padrao.txt\", \"estrutura_temporario.txt\"—doesn't immediately correspond to known legitimate files. This raises suspicion that these might be custom scripts or malicious binaries used for specific purposes.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that each event is a separate download from a different URL could indicate testing or an attempt to bypass download limits on the GitHub side, or simply using multiple sources to ensure at least one of them goes undetected.\n\nI should also consider if these activities are part of normal user behavior. While some users might run PowerShell scripts for various tasks, the combination here—multiple external downloads, temporary file creation\/deletion, varied command lines—is more indicative of a cyberattack or malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from external sources into TEMP directories and then deleting them. This pattern, along with varying GitHub repository accesses, suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at evading detection.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes:**\n   - Chrome.exe is flagged for network activities but these are normal.\n   - Powershell.exe events need closer examination due to its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Analyze Command Lines:**\n   - Commands download files from GitHub, e.g., \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...\/LICENSE.txt\".\n   - These downloads occur in TEMP directories with unique file names like \"modulo_padrao.txt\".\n\n3. **Note File Operations:**\n   - Temporary files are created and then deleted, possibly to erase traces.\n   - Example: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1\" is downloaded and deleted.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Powershell.exe accesses other processes and modifies registry values, which could be for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n5. **GitHub Repository Diversity:**\n   - Downloads come from various repositories, suggesting an attempt to avoid detection through multiple sources.\n\n6. **File Names and Actions:**\n   - Unusual file names like \"estrutura_temporario.txt\" don't match common legitimate files.\n   - The combination of downloads, temporary files, and deletions is suspicious.\n\n7. **User Behavior Context:**\n   - While some PowerShell use is normal, the described activities are indicative of potential malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe batch exhibits behaviors consistent with a cyberattack, including external file downloads, temporary file management, varied sources, and potential evasion tactics. These factors make the events highly suspicious and warrant further investigation as a security threat."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with CLASSIFICATION, JUSTIFICATION, and CONFIDENCE.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: chrome.exe setting a registry value. Not unusual since Chrome often tweaks the registry.\n2. **Event 2-3**: More instances of chrome.exe doing the same task. Still normal.\n3. **Event 4**: powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. This seems okay.\n4. **Event 5**: Powershell running a command to download something from GitHub into the TEMP folder. This could be suspicious because downloading files from external sources can indicate malicious activity or script execution.\n5. **Event 6**: Powershell creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Not sure about this one, but it's possible for legitimate scripts to create such files.\n6. **Events 7,9,12, etc.**: Multiple registry writes by powershell.exe and other processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Registry changes can be part of normal operations or malicious activities.\n7. **Event 8**: winlogbeat.exe creating a config file in its own directory. Looks benign unless there's something wrong with the file content.\n8. **Events involving cmd.exe**: One event shows cmd deleting a task named \"spawn\". Could be removing scheduled tasks, which might be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The command line \"\/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn\" suggests deletion of a specific task, which is something attackers might do to clean up their tracks.\n9. **Event with whoami.exe**: Running whoami without any suspicious arguments, just process creation. Probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags:\n\n- Powershell downloading and executing code from GitHub (Event 5). This could be a script trying to do something malicious.\n- cmd.exe deleting a task named \"spawn\" (Event 28), which might indicate an attempt to remove traces of previous activities or malware.\n- Multiple registry writes by various processes, including powershell.exe. While not all registry activity is bad, the combination with other events raises suspicion.\n\nI should also consider if these events are happening in sequence, possibly as part of a larger campaign. The use of multiple tools (powershell and cmd) to perform different actions might indicate scripting or automated behavior, which can be malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these could be legitimate admin tasks or script executions. However, the combination of downloading code from an external source, deleting scheduled tasks, and multiple registry changes leans towards potential malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as INTERESTING because it shows a series of actions that together suggest possible malicious behavior, such as downloading unknown scripts, attempting to delete traces of other processes, and modifying system configurations. The confidence isn't very high (maybe 60-70%) because while some events are suspicious, they could also be part of legitimate operations, but the combination is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicative of potential malicious activity, including Powershell downloading code from an external source and cmd.exe deleting a task.

Let me go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several instances where schtasks.exe is being used with the \/Delete command to remove a task called \"spawn\". That's suspicious because deleting tasks can be part of hiding malicious activities or removing persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, I notice multiple entries for cmd.exe and powershell.exe accessing the Registry. Specifically, commands like REG DELETE targeting specific registry keys under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. These are often used to remove entries added by malware during installation, which could indicate an attempt to clean up traces.\n\nThere's also a command-line argument in cmd.exe that deletes a value named \"modulo_temporario\" and another in reg.exe deleting \"pacote_auxiliar\". The use of REG DELETE suggests someone is trying to remove persistence mechanisms or installed programs from the system.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe, there are multiple instances where it's being accessed and used. Powershell is a powerful tool often abused by attackers for executing commands, downloading files, or running scripts. The repeated ProcessAccess events might indicate attempts to run malicious scripts or commands.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events showing that powershell.exe is loading various .NET framework components. While this isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the combination with other activities raises concern as attackers often use legitimate tools in unexpected ways.\n\nAnother point of interest is the command-line argument \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems incomplete or malformed. This might be an attempt to execute powershell without being too obvious, possibly using it to run a script or perform an action.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they show multiple attempts to delete scheduled tasks and registry entries, alongside extensive use of powershell.exe. These actions are common in post-exploitation activities where attackers try to erase their tracks and maintain persistence. The repeated ProcessCreate, RegistryEvent, and ImageLoad events tie together into a pattern that suggests potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm confident enough based on the combination of process creations, registry modifications, and powershell usage that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of schtasks.exe deleting tasks, cmd.exe and reg.exe modifying the registry to remove entries, and extensive use of powershell.exe, which together suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence removal or cleanup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. There are multiple entries showing that PowerShell is being used for various tasks like creating files, accessing processes, and setting registry values. That in itself isn't necessarily suspicious because PowerShell is a common tool used both by admins and attackers.\n\nLooking at the file paths mentioned, I see that some files are temporary (like the one in the Temp directory) which could be part of normal script execution. There's also a reference to MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which seems legitimate since it's an antivirus component.\n\nThere are events where PowerShell is creating and deleting files quickly, which might indicate some form of file handling or testing. The creation and deletion in quick succession could be a sign of something malicious trying to leave no trace, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\" and \"cmd.exe \/c\". These look like they're part of legitimate scripting or automated tasks. However, attackers might also abuse these commands for persistence or lateral movement. But again, without seeing unusual behavior patterns, it's tough to flag them as malicious.\n\nThe events involving registry changes (Registry value set) could be concerning because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations. However, legitimate software and scripts can do this too. The fact that both PowerShell.exe and conhost.exe are making these changes might not raise red flags unless there's an unusual volume or specific keys being targeted.\n\nI also see a lot of events where processes are accessed, like ProcessAccess. This is common in system administration tasks but could be part of privilege escalation techniques if combined with other actions.\n\nThere's one event where whoami.exe is run, which is typically used to check user permissions. This might be part of legitimate user enumeration or could be part of an attacker's process.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows a lot of PowerShell activity, which can be both normal and malicious. However, without specific indicators like known malware signatures, unusual file hashes, or irregular patterns beyond typical scripting behavior, it's hard to classify this as definitely suspicious.\n\nOn the other hand, the repetitive nature of certain commands and the use of temporary files might hint at some automated script running, perhaps for vulnerability scanning or system testing. This could be a red flag if it's unauthorized but not necessarily malicious in intent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there are elements that could warrant closer inspection, such as multiple registry changes and file operations, without additional context suggesting malicious intent, I'm leaning towards this batch being more about normal user or script activity than an actual security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate PowerShell activities such as file handling and registry modifications, which are common in system administration tasks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or patterns indicative of an attack.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a system's logs, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation purposes. The user mentioned that I should analyze the entire batch as a whole, considering all events together.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few events are about powershell.exe loading images. Specifically, it's loadingclrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. Then there's a file being created in the user's temp directory with a PowerShell script name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. After that, the same file is deleted. That seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script could be part of some malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe creates pipes, accesses processes, and sets registry values. The repetition here might indicate that PowerShell is being used for some automated tasks or possibly to maintain persistence. Also, multiple instances of RegistryEvent from both chrome.exe and conhost.exe are present, which could be red flags if these processes are modifying system settings in an unusual way.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe execution event, which by itself isn't malicious but can be part of credential dumping or information gathering. Then there's another PowerShell process creation with a command line that tries to remove an item from the TEMP directory, specifically objeo_principal.zip. That file name seems off, and attempting to delete it without any apparent reason might indicate malicious intent.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple powershell.exe instances, script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, whoami execution, and attempts to delete files in temp directories. These actions could be part of a larger attack chain, possibly indicating reconnaissance, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events show the command lines for these processes, which gives more context. The use of '&' to chain commands might suggest they're trying to execute multiple scripts or hide certain activities by chaining them together, making it harder to detect each individual command separately.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated RegistryEvent tasks from different processes could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations to allow further attacks. Since some events come from chrome.exe and conhost.exe, which are usually benign, their involvement here raises questions about whether they're being abused as part of a larger campaign.\n\nOverall, the combination of these activities doesn't look like normal user behavior. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific file operations and registry changes is concerning. It's possible that this batch could be part of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) activity or other malicious campaigns aiming to gain access, move within the network, or exfiltrate data.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors together, the batch does seem relevant for further investigation because the collective actions are indicative of potential malicious behavior rather than routine operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe performing potentially suspicious activities such as script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and attempts to delete files in temp directories.

These actions collectively suggest potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. The tasks include Image loaded, File created, and File Delete logged. Notably, a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 was created and then deleted. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting files in the temp directory quickly might be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is used with command lines that remove specific files from the TEMP directory. For example, Remove-Item commands targeting .zip and .txt files like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, estrutura_geral.zip, and others. The consistent use of $env:TEMP suggests these are temporary files being cleaned up after some operation.\n\nThe command lines also include \"&\" which is a common way to execute PowerShell scripts in the background, often used to hide malicious activities. Additionally, the events show that multiple files across different categories (base, componente, estrutura) are being deleted, indicating possibly a systematic cleanup of evidence.\n\nThere's an event where chrome.exe accesses a registry value and loads MpOAV.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. That might not be unusual, but it's worth noting if there are other indicators of compromise around it.\n\nAnother event involves conhost.exe accessing the registry, which could be part of legitimate processes but sometimes used by malicious actors for command-line tools or scripts.\n\nThe \"whoami.exe\" process stands out as well. It's a common tool for determining user information, and its execution might be part of reconnaissance activities to gather system details.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows repeated PowerShell activity with file deletions in the TEMP directory, which are red flags for potential malicious behavior. The systematic deletion of various files suggests an attempt to remove traces of prior actions, possibly exfiltration or data manipulation. The use of multiple .zip and .txt files being removed could indicate that sensitive information was extracted and then cleaned up.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the pattern of file deletions by PowerShell, coupled with the specific naming conventions in the filenames (like tarefa_base,estrutura_geral), suggests a coordinated effort to remove evidence. While some events might be benign, the combination points towards suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file deletions in the TEMP directory and accessing registry values.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved, most are powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses different files and registry values. For example, it loads mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are legitimate .NET framework components, but sometimes attackers use these for obfuscation or loading malicious libraries.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe is creating temporary files in the user's AppData directory. Specifically, there's a file being created and then immediately deleted. The paths like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\" seem suspicious. Creating and deleting scripts quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the command lines of the powershell.exe instances. They're executing Remove-Item commands against files in the TEMP directory. This suggests that the script is trying to delete specific files, possibly logs or evidence of previous activities. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore indicates they're trying to remove them without user interaction and suppress errors.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run. That tool is typically used to determine the current user's identity, which could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at other processes, chrome.exe has several registry writes. While Chrome does make registry changes for configuration, multiple events might indicate something amiss, especially if they're not usual browsing activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a config file. That seems normal unless it's part of log tampering or unauthorized data exfiltration.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows powershell.exe performing several actions that are often associated with malicious behavior: creating\/deleting files in temp directories, accessing registry values, and running whoami for user info. The repeated attempts to delete files could be an attempt to cover tracks. While some activities might be legitimate, the combination raises concerns about potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell.exe processes creating and deleting temporary files, accessing registry values, and executing commands that may indicate suspicious activity such as file deletion attempts and potential reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. There are several entries here, so I'll need to analyze them collectively rather than individually.\n\nStarting with the first few events, I see processes like chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe performing registry value sets. Registry modifications can be normal for legitimate software or part of malicious activities. But in isolation, it's hard to tell if these are suspicious since many applications tweak the registry during operation.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. Whoami is a standard Windows tool that outputs user information, so seeing it run isn't unusual. It's often used in scripts or by legitimate processes to determine the current user. However, repeated executions might warrant attention, but not necessarily raise red flags on their own.\n\nNext up are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating files. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could indicate scripting or automation, which isn't inherently suspicious unless the command-line arguments suggest something nefarious. In these logs, I don't see specific commands, just the process creation and file operations.\n\nLooking at the files created by powershell.exe, there's one called pacote_ativo.txt. The name doesn't immediately signal anything malicious, but without knowing the content or context, it's hard to say. It could be a benign script output or part of an attack.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. Winlogbeat is likely related to log management, possibly part of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for forwarding logs. This seems normal and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple registry writes, several process creations for whoami.exe and powershell.exe, file creations, but nothing that stands out as overtly malicious. There's no evidence of known attack patterns, such as repeated failed login attempts, unusual file accesses, or execution of suspicious binaries. The activities could be part of legitimate system operations, maintenance scripts, or even log management processes.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate because while the events aren't outright suspicious, there are enough indicators that might raise an eyebrow for a security professional to investigate further. However, without additional context or more severe indicators, it's not clear-cut malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creations and file operations, including legitimate tools like whoami.exe and PowerShell, which do not indicate malicious behavior on their own.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}\n```"}
