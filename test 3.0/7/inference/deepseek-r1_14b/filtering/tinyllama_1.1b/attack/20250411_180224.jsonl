So I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and my job is to analyze the entire batch to determine if it's relevant for investigation. The output should be a single classification—either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\"—along with a justification and a confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: This is a process creation event where `cmd.exe` is run with some command-line arguments. The command seems suspicious because it's using schtasks to create a task that runs daily under the system account. The script path in the command is `c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, which stands out because \"NonExistingScript\" suggests it might not be a legitimate file. Malware often uses non-existent or temporary scripts to execute malicious commands.\n\n2. **Event 2**: Powershell.exe is accessed, but without any specific command-line details provided here. However, since powershell can be used for both benign and malicious activities, especially when combined with other tools like schtasks, this could be a red flag.\n\n3. **Event 3**: Another cmd.exe process that sets a registry value. Registry modifications are common in malware to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\n4. **Event 4**: schtasks.exe loads the taskschd.dll library. This is normal when scheduling tasks, but given the previous events involving schtasks and powershell, this could be part of a malicious routine.\n\n5. **Event 5**: Another process creation with schtasks.exe querying a task named \"win32times.\" Querying existing tasks might indicate checking if a malicious task was successfully created or if it's trying to avoid detection by ensuring the task exists.\n\n6. **Event 6**: schtasks.exe again loading taskschd.dll, which seems redundant but could be part of multiple steps in the attack chain.\n\n7. **Event 7**: conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is typically used for console windows but can sometimes be abused by malware.\n\n8. **Events 8-11**: Multiple instances of chrome.exe accessing registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry, especially for extensions and settings, multiple such events in a short time might indicate something suspicious, like a script or extension behaving maliciously, or possibly credential dumping.\n\n9. **Event 12**: winlogbeat.exe creates a file related to its configuration. Winlogbeat is likely part of their monitoring setup, so this seems benign unless it's being used as a vector, but there's no indication here that it's compromised.\n\n10. **Event 13**: whoami.exe is run without any arguments. This is often used by attackers to check user privileges or system information, which could be an early step in lateral movement or reconnaissance.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch together: The combination of creating a scheduled task with powershell via schtasks and cmd.exe, accessing registry values with multiple processes (cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe), and using whoami.exe could indicate several things. It might be an attacker attempting to establish persistence, create a backdoor, or move laterally within the network.\n\nThe presence of the non-existing script path suggests that the file doesn't exist on the system, which is a common technique to avoid detection because there's no file for antivirus to scan. Powershell with -ep bypass is another red flag since it can execute code without being detected by some security solutions.\n\nThe multiple registry accesses could be part of installing a persistent backdoor or modifying system configurations to allow for future access. Chrome's involvement might not be direct but could be due to an extension or script injected into the browser, which is a common vector for attacks.\n\nWhile there are legitimate uses for these processes (like using schtasks for scheduled tasks), the combination and specific command-line arguments make this batch suspicious. The confidence in it being interesting is high because several indicators point towards potential malicious activity rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities, such as the creation of a scheduled task with suspicious command-line arguments involving powershell.exe and the use of whoami.exe. These actions suggest possible unauthorized system access or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
