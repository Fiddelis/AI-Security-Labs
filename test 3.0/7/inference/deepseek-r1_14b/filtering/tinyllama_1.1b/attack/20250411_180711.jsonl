Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connection detections. That seems normal because Chrome makes a lot of connections, especially when you're browsing the web. So these might just be regular activities and probably aren't suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, I see an entry for whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a standard system tool used to display user information, so that's not unusual unless it's part of some privilege escalation or reconnaissance. But in this case, there's no indication of anything wrong with how it's being used. It just shows the process creation, which could be legitimate.\n\nNext up are several events related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious activities. Let me look closely at these entries:\n\n1. The first event is about Process Access, which means another process accessed itâ€”this isn't unusual and might just be normal system behavior.\n2. Then there's a Registry value set. This could be part of legitimate configuration changes or it could indicate malicious activity trying to persistence.\n3. There are multiple Image Load events pointing to various DLLs. Some of these, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, are related to Windows Defender, so that makes sense if the system is running Defender scripts during PowerShell execution.\n4. A File Delete event for a specific .ps1 script in the Temp directory. Deleting files could be part of cleaning up evidence, which might be suspicious. This file path looks temporary, and deleting it after use isn't uncommon, but it's something to note.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe is run with a command line that includes some XOR encryption on plaintext data. The script seems to base64 encode or obfuscate the data before sending it over HTTP POST to example.com. Obfuscation techniques like this are often used in malware to hide malicious activities from detection, which makes this event more concerning.\n\nThere are two identical entries with the same command line and task 'Provider Lifecycle', which might be part of the script's execution flow, possibly establishing some kind of communication or persistence mechanism.\n\nAdditionally, there's a File Create event for a .yml file by winlogbeat.exe, which is an agent used to collect logs. That seems benign as it's probably setting up configuration files during its operation.\n\nPutting this all together, the key red flags are:\n\n- The powershell.exe process accessing and executing potentially malicious scripts.\n- Use of XOR encryption on data before sending it, which is a common tactic in APTs or malware to avoid detection.\n- Deletion of a temporary script file after execution, possibly to erase traces of the attack.\n\nWhile individual events might not raise alarms, the combination of multiple suspicious activities related to PowerShell and the use of encryption suggests potential malicious intent. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation, especially focusing on the powershell.exe activity and its associated files.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events is determined to be of interest for investigation due to several red flags:\n\n1. **Multiple Network Connections from Chrome**: While normal, these should be monitored if they seem excessive or unusual.\n\n2. **whoami.exe Execution**: This could be part of system reconnaissance and warrants further checking for any unauthorized access patterns.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Registry and Image Load Events**: The registry changes might indicate persistence mechanisms.\n   - **File Operations**: The deletion of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory is suspicious, suggesting an attempt to remove evidence.\n\n4. **Obfuscation Techniques**: Use of XOR encryption on data sent over HTTP suggests potential malicious activity aiming to avoid detection.\n\n5. **Command Line Execution**: The specific command line arguments for powershell.exe are concerning and may indicate a scripting effort for malicious purposes.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these factors, particularly the PowerShell activities involving encrypted data transmission and file deletion, justifies further investigation into possible security threats or breaches."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event involves chrome.exe loading an image related to Windows Defender. That seems normal because Chrome can load various DLLs, especially if they're part of system services like antivirus. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext up is whoami.exe being executed. It just runs the default command line without any unusual arguments. Whoami is a common utility, so that's not red flagging anything for me.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe showing up multiple times. The first time it sets a registry value, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of legitimate scripting or malicious activity. Looking at the command line, it's executing a script to remove some files in a specific directory, which is where things start to get interesting. The paths being deleted are \"C:\\objeto_temporario\\objeto_auxiliar\\..\\\" and so on. These look like constructed paths with \"..\" which could be trying to traverse directories, maybe accessing parent directories that they shouldn't.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe loading mscoreei.dll, which is part of the .NET framework, so that's expected and not a red flag yet.\n\nThen it creates a file in the user's Downloads folder called estrutura_temporario.txt. That could be anything, but since it's created by PowerShell, I'm paying attention because scripts often create temporary files.\n\nAfter that, there are several events where chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. Registry changes can indicate configuration settings, which might be normal or could be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. Repeated writes to the same or different keys without a clear purpose make this more concerning.\n\nLooking further, I see powershell.exe creating files in the Temp directory with specific names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1. These are temporary script files generated by PowerShell when running scripts, especially signed ones. The fact that it's creating and then immediately deleting these files (as seen in a later event where FileDeleteDetected is logged) makes me think this could be part of a script trying to bypass certain policies or execute commands without leaving traces.\n\nThe next set of events has powershell.exe using the Provider Lifecycle task, which typically deals with loading modules or snap-ins. The command lines are again attempting to remove specific files in various directories. The paths being targeted seem to have backslashes and directory traversal (using \"..\") repeatedly, which could be trying to reach higher-level directories than intended. This kind of path manipulation is a classic tactic in attacks to access restricted areas or delete files outside the expected scope.\n\nThen there's an event where it creates a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. This is part of the user profile and often used by PowerShell for configuration when starting non-interactive sessions. While not necessarily bad, combined with other actions, it raises an eyebrow.\n\nAnother whoami.exe execution follows, which again isn't suspicious on its own but adds to the context of the events happening around the same time.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell.exe instances, creating and deleting temporary files, accessing registry values repeatedly, using directory traversal in file paths, and trying to delete various scripts. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity such as script execution for persistence or data theft. The repeated attempts to access and modify system components without a clear legitimate purpose are red flags.\n\nSo, yes, this batch of logs is definitely worth investigating further. It could indicate a compromised system with an attacker using PowerShell scripts to carry out their objectives.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe log events exhibit several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Multiple Powershell.exe Instances**: The repeated execution of powershell.exe, especially with command-line arguments that attempt file deletions and directory traversals, is suspicious.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**: Powershell creates temporary files in the Temp directory, which are immediately deleted. This behavior can be a tactic to avoid detection or persistence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Frequent registry writes by chrome.exe and powershell.exe without clear legitimate purposes could indicate attempts at system configuration changes, possibly for persistence.\n\n4. **Directory Traversal**: The use of \"..\" in file paths suggests efforts to access restricted directories, a common technique in attacks to reach unintended areas.\n\n5. **Script Execution Concerns**: The creation of script files and their subsequent deletion, along with the use of non-interactive PowerShell profiles, raises concerns about potential malicious scripting for persistence or data theft.\n\n**Conclusion:** This batch of logs should be thoroughly investigated as it exhibits hallmarks of possible cyber threats, including malware activities using Powershell scripts."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of events from a system log that I need to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed. Powershell is a common tool but can also be used maliciously. Notably, some of these executions have command lines that look suspicious. For example:\n\n1. The event where cmd.exe is used with commands like \"sc.exe stop\" and \"delete\". This seems like someone is trying to stop or delete services, which could indicate an attempt to remove indicators of compromise or disable security mechanisms.\n2. There are several instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often modify the registry to persistence their malware or change system configurations.\n3. The creation and deletion of temporary files in %temp% by cmd.exe, like del \/A:H %%temp%%\\tarefa_logico.txt, suggests that someone is trying to clean up traces of their activity, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n4. The repeated use of whoami.exe might be an attempt to gather information about the user or system privileges, which could be part of reconnaissance activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads various .dll files and creates files in the Temp directory, followed by deleting them immediately. This behavior is concerning because it can indicate that malicious scripts are being executed and cleaned up to avoid detection.\n\nThe justification for considering this batch as interesting is the combination of these activities: repeated use of command-line tools with potentially harmful commands, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in sensitive locations, and attempts to manipulate services. These patterns collectively suggest possible malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n\nAs for confidence, while not all events are definitively malicious on their own, the cluster of suspicious activities increases the likelihood that something is amiss. However, without more context or evidence of actual exploit execution, it's a moderate concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe executing potentially malicious commands, including service deletion, file manipulation, and registry modifications. These activities suggest possible unauthorized system changes or attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, meaning each line is a separate JSON object. Each object has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few events: There's whoami.exe being executed, powershell.exe being accessed, cmd.exe deleting a file. Then more powershell.exe accesses and some file creations. Also, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is called with commands to remove items in the TEMP directory. These seem suspicious because deleting files in TEMP could be part of malicious activities like cleaning up traces.\n\nI notice that several events involve powershell.exe executing scripts, especially removing files from the TEMP directory. This behavior is often seen in malware to erase logs or evidence of their activity. Additionally, there are multiple ProcessCreate and FileDeleteDetected tasks logged, which might indicate some sort of automated deletion process.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with similar command lines makes me think this isn't just normal script execution but could be part of a larger campaign. Also, the file paths like 'modulo_base.exe' being deleted by cmd.exe suggest that other files are being removed as well, possibly to cover tracks.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of deletion activities across different processes and times. This combination raises red flags because malicious actors often delete logs or temporary files to avoid detection. The multiple attempts to remove the same file in TEMP make me more confident that something is amiss.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch does look interesting for investigation because of potential malicious deletions and repeated suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing and deleting files, particularly in the TEMP directory.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation. The output should be a single JSON result with classification as INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the data. Each line is a separate event. Let's look at each one:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Powershell.exe loading a DLL file (clrjit.dll). This seems normal because PowerShell often loads .NET components.\n2. **Event 2**: File deletion by PowerShell of a temp script. Deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but the specific script name (__PSScriptPolicyTest) might be related to policy testing, which could indicate malicious activity or a tool trying to bypass policies.\n3. **Events 3-10**: Multiple events showing 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks for powershell.exe. These are standard PowerShell operations, so not suspicious on their own but combined with others might raise flags.\n4. **Event 11**: whoami.exe execution. This is a common system command to check user permissions. It's often used by scripts or tools, including malicious ones, to gather information.\n5. **Events 12-20**: Repeated 'Process accessed' events for both powershell.exe and whoami.exe. These are normal access checks but could indicate process injection or privilege escalation attempts if combined with other activities.\n6. **Event 21**: File creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely related to log shipping or monitoring. This seems benign unless the file path is suspicious, but here it looks like a configuration file.\n\nPutting this together: The batch includes multiple instances of PowerShell executing and accessing processes, along with whoami.exe being used. The deletion of a temp script could be part of hiding traces. While each event individually might not be concerning, the combination suggests possible malicious activity. However, without more context or indicators like unusual file hashes or network traffic, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because while some events are potentially suspicious, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior beyond normal scripting activities. But I'm not entirely sure; the justification is a bit iffy.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly standard system activities like PowerShell operations and whoami.exe execution, which are common and not indicative of malicious behavior without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
