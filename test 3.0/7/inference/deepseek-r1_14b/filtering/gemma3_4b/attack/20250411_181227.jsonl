{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first six entries are all process events showing powershell.exe being executed with a command line that schedules tasks. Each seems to be creating a new scheduled task using different names like 'unidade_ativo', 'registro_geral', etc., and they're setting the trigger to AtLogon, targeting Administrators group with highest privileges. This is concerning because it looks like these are persistence mechanismsâ€”malware often creates scheduled tasks to run at logon.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is just named without a command line, followed by another one accessing something via ProcessAccess. Next, two events show Registry value sets. These could be related to creating or modifying registry keys for the scheduled tasks or other persistence methods.\n\nAn interesting event comes next: powershell.exe executing a command that creates a new task (tarefa_geral), which is similar to the earlier ones but perhaps part of a different script execution. This reinforces the idea of multiple scheduled tasks being created, possibly by malicious scripts.\n\nAfter that, several events show chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying registry values. While this could be normal browser activity, it's a bit unusual if these actions are out of context, like during system startup or when no browser is running.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various .NET framework components. This seems normal as powershell would load those libraries when executing scripts, especially ones that interact with the registry and scheduling tasks.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple scheduled tasks created by powershell.exe targeting high-privilege users at logon. The repeated attempts to create these tasks, along with some process and registry activity, are red flags for potential malicious behavior. While not conclusive on their own, the combination suggests possible persistence mechanisms or credential dumping activities.\n\nI'm confident enough that this batch is interesting because it shows suspicious scripting activity aimed at maintaining persistence, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activities:**\n   - Multiple events show `powershell.exe` executing commands to create scheduled tasks (e.g., `New-ScheduledTask`). These tasks are set to run at logon with high privileges, which is a common technique for persistence in malware.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Details:**\n   - The command lines indicate the creation of several tasks with different names but similar purposes. This suggests automated or script-driven task creation, potentially malicious.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Events:**\n   - Registry modifications (`RegistryEvent`) could be part of creating these tasks or other persistence mechanisms.\n   - `ProcessAccess` events on `powershell.exe` might indicate it's being monitored or used in a way that's unusual.\n\n4. **Chrome Activity:**\n   - While `chrome.exe` is common, the pipe creation and registry changes are worth noting if they don't align with normal browser behavior.\n\n5. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Powershell loading .NET libraries is standard for script execution but could be part of more malicious activities.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The combination of multiple scheduled tasks created by powershell, registry modifications, and process activity raises suspicion of potential malware attempting persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch exhibits signs of suspicious scripting and persistence mechanisms likely used in cyberattacks, making it interesting for further investigation. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks created by powershell.exe with high privileges, registry modifications, and other process activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line represents an event with process info, windows log task, and file details.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is the process name. Powershell is commonly used for scripting but can also be abused by attackers. Looking closer, some of these have command lines that create scheduled tasks. For example, there's a line where the command is creating a new scheduled task to execute calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. That seems suspicious because it's adding a persistent task that runs on startup, which could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, I notice that some events are about files being created and deleted in temporary directories. The file paths look legitimate, but the fact that a script is created and then immediately deleted might be an attempt to avoid detection. Temporary files can be used for staging malicious code before it's executed or deleted to leave fewer traces.\n\nAnother point is the registry changes made by chrome.exe. While Chrome does make registry changes as part of its normal operation, multiple entries could indicate something more nefarious, especially if they're modifying system settings in a way that's not typical user behavior. But without more context on what exactly was changed, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nBut the most concerning parts are the powershell.exe activities. The scheduled task setup is particularly worrying because it allows code execution at logon with high privileges. This could be part of an attack chain aiming to maintain persistence and escalate privileges. Also, the remote command executions logged might suggest that the system was compromised, allowing attackers to execute commands over the network.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of powershell script injections creating scheduled tasks, temporary file operations, and multiple remote command executions points towards potential malicious activity. These aren't isolated incidents but a series of events that could indicate an attack in progress or post-attack activities like lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm not seeing any immediate indicators that would classify this as definitely benign. The high number of suspicious powershell commands and the remote execution tasks stand out, making me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities including creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe, temporary file operations, and numerous remote command executions. These indicators suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms and privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, which does interact with system files. Not a red flag here.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files. Svchost.exe is a common system process that hosts various services, so these activities aren't unusual unless they're part of an exploit. But just seeing the events doesn't immediately raise concerns.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The path seems normal, but I'm noting this as potentially interesting if it's unexpected activity.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe entries involving registry changes and loading DLLs like amsi.dll. Chrome sometimes loads system files, especially anti-malware ones like MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nI also notice powershell.exe creating two different text files in the Downloads folder: entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but combined with other powershell activity, it's something to watch.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is involved in file creation too, which makes sense if it's part of log management or ELK stack setup. That doesn't raise any flags unless there's unauthorized access.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple registry writes from chrome.exe. While frequent updates aren't necessarily malicious, a high volume could indicate something abnormal, but I don't have enough context to say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together: there are legitimate processes doing their usual tasks. However, the powershell and svchost activities might warrant closer inspection because they can be used in attacks. The creation of files by these processes, especially if not expected, adds some concern. But without clear signs like failed logins, unusual file names, or network traffic, it's hard to label this as malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because there are multiple events that could potentially be part of an attack chain, but I'm not certain. My confidence is medium because while some activities look normal, others might indicate early stages of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal system processes and activities such as legitimate file operations and registry updates by known processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or anomalies in the events provided.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
