{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities like executing scripts or commands. The command lines in some of these events show paths to .ps1 files, which suggests that PowerShell is being used to run scripts.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes: there's a lot of \"Registry value set\" actions from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Modifying registry entries can be part of malicious activities to persistence or change system configurations. Additionally, some events show file creations, like 'objeto_temporario.txt' being created, which might be used as temporary storage for malicious purposes.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of \"Registry value set\" tasks from chrome.exe is a bit concerning because Chrome isn't typically known for modifying the registry in such ways. This could indicate tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nAnother point of interest is the number of times Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is referenced in the command lines. This script name sounds like it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic for keyloggers used by attackers to steal sensitive information.\n\nThe fact that multiple different paths are being used to execute Get-Keystrokes.ps1 might indicate an attempt to evade detection or spread across the system. Each command line variation could be part of a larger campaign to ensure persistence and avoid simple signature-based detection.\n\nAlso, the events involving mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc., are loaded by powershell.exe. These are legitimate .NET framework components, but their presence alongside malicious script execution might raise suspicions about obfuscation or lateral movement within the system.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows several red flags: multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious scripts, registry modifications that could be persistence mechanisms, and repeated attempts to execute keylogging scripts from various locations. These activities don't appear to be normal user behavior and could indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), registry modifications, and file creations suggest possible unauthorized system activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. I'm looking at the JSONL data provided. Each line represents an event with process info, winlog task, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's common for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because PowerShell can execute scripts and commands. The command lines in some events show paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 which sounds suspicious—it might be trying to log keystrokes or steal information.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there are several instances where files are created or deleted in temporary directories (like %TEMP%). This is a red flag because attackers often use temp folders to hide malicious activities. For example, creating and then deleting files quickly can help avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there's an event where a remote command is executed. That could mean someone is accessing the system from another location, which might be part of an attack.\n\nOther events involve loading different DLLs and registry changes. While some are normal Windows operations, others could indicate malicious behavior if they're unexpected or repeated frequently.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of PowerShell for potentially harmful scripts, file operations in temp directories, remote command execution, and unusual file loads—I think this batch is definitely worth investigating. It seems like there might be some malicious activity going on.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell.exe processes executing scripts with potentially malicious intent, such as keystroke logging and file operations in temporary directories, which are common indicators of suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
