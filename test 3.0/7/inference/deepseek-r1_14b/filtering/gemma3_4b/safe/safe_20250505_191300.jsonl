Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from MpCmdRun.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. They show image loads and file creations in the Windows Defender directory. That's normal since MpCmdRun.exe is a legitimate process handling scans. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, I see winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file. Winlogbeat is an ETL parser, so it's expected behavior when setting up or updating its configuration. No red flags there.\n\nThen there are several events from svchost.exe and OneDriveLauncher.exe loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These are standard processes running within the Windows environment, so their activity is normal.\n\nThe majority of the logs are from Discord.exe. There's a lot going on here: network connections being made, process accesses, pipe creations, and even a reg.exe command querying the Run registry key for Discord. While some of these actions might look concerning at first glance—like checking the registry or multiple network connections—it's important to consider the context.\n\nDiscord is known for its rich features, which include voice and video calls, file transfers, and background processes. The repeated NetworkConnect events could be due to establishing connections with Discord's servers, especially if the user is active on the platform. Similarly, Pipe Created events are typical inter-process communication in applications like Discord.\n\nThe reg.exe command querying the Run registry key for Discord might seem suspicious, but it's a legitimate check that many applications perform to ensure they're not already running or to handle their startup behavior correctly.\n\nTaking all these into account, there doesn't appear to be any evidence of malicious activity. All processes are either legitimate system components or activities from known software like Windows Defender and Discord performing normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal system processes such as Windows Defender, Discord, and legitimate file operations. There is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies in the log entries.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first few entries are all from \"Discord.exe\" with tasks like \"Pipe Created.\" That seems normal because Discord is a chat application and might create pipes for inter-process communication. The same goes for the next few events; they're just repeated actions by Discord, which isn't unusual.\n\nThen I see an event where \"reg.exe\" is used to add a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That's interesting because reg.exe is typically for modifying the registry, and setting a value here could mean that Discord is adding itself to the startup list. However, since it's Discord doing this as part of its normal operation, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events by Discord.exe. These could just be legitimate process checks or maybe some form of debugging. Not too concerning yet.\n\nThe logs show several network connection attempts by Discord.exe. Again, since Discord is a communication app, connecting to the internet is expected. But if these connections are frequent or going to unusual domains, that might raise flags. However, without knowing the specifics of where they're connecting, it's hard to say. Still, it's part of normal operation.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple \"Registry value set\" tasks by Discord.exe. This could be related to configuration changes within the app. Since Discord is known to update its settings, this might not be suspicious unless the registry modifications are out of the ordinary.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\modules\\discord_dispatch-1\\discord_dispatch\\index.js. Creating files in the app data directory is standard for applications that update or cache modules, so this doesn't seem unusual.\n\nAn image load event for urlmon.dll by SDXHelper.exe catches my eye. Urlmon is a legitimate Windows DLL used for URL mapping and protocol handling. If SDXHelper is part of Discord's helper processes, it might be loading this DLL for normal operations. But I'm not entirely sure if that's standard behavior without more context.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple normal activities from Discord.exe like creating pipes, accessing processes, making network connections, and modifying the registry. The only slightly concerning point is the use of reg.exe to set a registry value, but since it's part of the app's setup or update process, it's likely benign. There are no signs of unusual file creations in restricted areas or unexpected network destinations. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem to indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operations of Discord.exe, including process creation, pipe creation, registry modifications, and network connections, which are expected for a communication application.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events from a user's system logs. The first thing I notice is that all the events are related to Discord.exe. It starts with File created and then moves through various tasks like Process Create, Image Load, Registry value set, Network connections, and more.\n\nI know that Discord is a legitimate application used for communication, so seeing its processes is normal. Each event seems to be part of the standard operations when starting up or running Discord—like loading images, accessing registry values, creating temporary files, and establishing network connections.\n\nThere's nothing here that stands out as malicious. No unusual file creations outside Discord's expected modules, no suspicious network traffic indicators, and all activities are consistent with how a legitimate application operates. The repetition of ProcessAccess tasks might seem concerning, but that's just part of the app's normal operation.\n\nSince there's no evidence of any anomalies or signs of malicious behavior across the entire batch, I classify this as NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to a legitimate application (Discord.exe) performing normal operations such as process creation, file access, and network connections.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data, there are multiple entries. The first event shows Discord.exe changing the file creation time for a .tmp file in the Discord Network folder. That's a bit unusual because why would Discord need to change file times? Maybe it's normal, but I'm not sure.\n\nNext, there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting logs, so that seems okay unless it's doing something unexpected here. But the path looks legitimate, so probably nothing to worry about.\n\nThen, there are several events where Discord.exe accesses processes without any files involved. I'm not sure what \"Process accessed\" means exactly—maybe it's related to inter-process communication? It happens multiple times, which makes me think maybe it's part of Discord's regular operation.\n\nAfter that, a lot of the events are about network connections detected from Discord.exe. This is concerning because if an application is connecting to many different networks repeatedly, especially in such high numbers, it could be a sign of malicious activity. Maybe it's establishing multiple connections for some reason, like data exfiltration or communication with external servers.\n\nI notice that there are 19 entries where Network connection detected happens from Discord.exe. That seems excessive. Normally, an application might open a few connections, but this is way beyond what would be typical for Discord unless they're updating or doing something in the background. But given the high count, it's suspicious.\n\nAlso, looking at the file paths, the .tmp files being modified have UUID-like names. That doesn't ring any bells as malicious per se, but combined with all the network activity, it makes me think there could be something going on.\n\nI don't see any other processes doing anything out of the ordinary except smartscreen.exe and taskhostw.exe loading standard system DLLs. Those seem normal because they're part of Windows' regular operations.\n\nPutting this together: Discord is making a lot of network connections, which might indicate it's acting as a bot or communicating with multiple servers. The file changes could be related to storing malicious data temporarily before exfiltration. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure, but the high number of network events and process accesses makes me lean towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains numerous network connection attempts from Discord.exe, which may indicate unusual activity such as potential botnet behavior or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of events here, all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from \"Discord.exe\". There are multiple entries where Discord is detected with network connections and process accesses. For example, there are several instances where the task is \"Network connection detected\" and others where it's \"Process accessed.\" These could be normal operations since Discord is a chat application that often connects to servers and interacts with other processes.\n\nThen there are some events from other processes like \"winlogbeat.exe,\" which I think might be an agent used for logging. It created a file in the downloads folder, which seems routine if that's part of its setup or update process. Similarly, \"sppsvc.exe\" loading a system32 file and \"svchost.exe\" modifying registry values also appear to be standard activities since these are common Windows processes.\n\nI'm trying to see if there's any unusual behavior here. All the Discord-related events seem repetitive but not necessarily malicious on their own. The other processes don't show anything out of place either. No file deletions, strange network traffic, or unexpected privilege escalations that I can spot.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while each individual event might be logged for various reasons, there's no clear pattern indicating suspicious activity when considering the entire batch as a whole. The events don't suggest any coordinated malicious behavior but rather normal operations across different system components.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of routine system activities, including network connections and file operations by Discord.exe and other common processes like winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe.
