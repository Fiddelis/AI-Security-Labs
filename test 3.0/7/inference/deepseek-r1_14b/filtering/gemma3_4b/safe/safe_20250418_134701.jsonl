The paths are like C:\\Users\\...\\\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp followed by various filenames with extensions .d.ts. These look like TypeScript definition files.

The process name is \"git.exe\", which suggests that Git is being used. The task is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. The file paths all point to different TypeScript files within a Cypress module under the node_modules directory of a user's project.\n\nHmm, so each event shows that a specific file was created by git.exe. Since these are all under node_modules, which is where npm packages like Cypress are installed, it seems related to development activities. The filenames look like type definitions for various functions in Lodash's functional programming utilities. These files are being created during the setup or update of the project dependencies.\n\nI'm thinking about what could be concerning here. Git being used is common in development environments, and creating files under node_modules typically happens when installing or updating packages. Since all these events are related to file creation in a standard location for npm modules, this doesn't raise any red flags. There's no indication of unauthorized access, suspicious process names, or writes to sensitive directories outside the project scope.\n\nAnother point is that each event only reports a file being created. There's no other action like deletion, modification of system files, network connections, or anything else that might indicate malicious activity. The consistent naming and location make me think this is part of a normal development workflow, perhaps during an npm install or a script execution.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of log injection or false positives, but given the uniformity and context (node_modules), it's unlikely to be a security issue.

The common elements across all these events are that the process name is \"git.exe\", the task under winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file paths all lead to various .d.ts files within a node_modules folder for Cypress.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this batch as a whole is interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let's break it down.\n\nThe process name being git.exe suggests that Git is being used, which makes sense in a development environment where people might be working with code repositories. Node modules like cypress are commonly associated with front-end testing frameworks. The specific files being created here are TypeScript definition files (the .d.ts extension), which are typically part of the build process for TypeScript projects.\n\nLooking at all these file creation events, they're all within the node_modules folder, which is standard for npm packages. Each event shows a different file being created under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/. The file names vary but follow a pattern, like stubArray.d.ts, stubFalse.d.ts, etc., which are likely part of Cypress's type definitions.\n\nNow, considering potential malicious activities, I should think about what could be concerning here. Unusual file creation patterns might indicate something is wrong, like the creation of unexpected files or files in unusual locations. However, in this case, all these files are expected to exist within a typical development setup using Git and npm for package management.\n\nIt's also important to note that while each individual event isn't suspicious on its own, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. But here, the pattern is consistent with normal development activities. The same process (git.exe) creating multiple files in expected locations doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nMoreover, the fact that all events are file creation tasks under winlog and they're part of a node_modules folder suggests this is related to a build or installation process during development. There's no indication of files being deleted, modified in suspicious ways, or accessed by unauthorized processes.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether these file creations could be part of a larger attack vector. For example, sometimes attackers create new files as part of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement. However, the specific files here are type definitions which don't serve such purposes. They're more about code structure and type checking rather than anything malicious.\n\nI should also think about how these events would look in a typical log analysis scenario. Security operations teams often look for anomalies, but in this case, each event aligns with expected behavior in a software development environment using Git and npm packages. There's no evidence of file hashes being suspicious or indicators of compromise (IoCs) like known malicious filenames or paths.\n\nAdditionally, considering the frequency, if these events happened over a short period, it might look more normal than concerning. It could be part of a script running during a build process or a developer checking out and installing dependencies.\n\nIn summary, each event is benign on its own, and collectively they don't indicate any malicious activity. They fit the profile of routine file operations in a development environment using Git and node.js packages.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events as a whole does not appear to be suspicious from a cybersecurity perspective. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- **Process**: The process name is `git.exe`, which is commonly used for version control and is expected in a development environment.\n- **Task**: The task under `winlog` indicates file creation, which aligns with normal operations during software development, such as installing or updating packages.\n- **Files**: All files being created are `.d.ts` files within the `node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/` directory. These are standard TypeScript definition files typically included in npm packages and are not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events describe normal file creation activities during development using Git and npm, with no signs of suspicious or malicious behavior."}

The pattern here is that these are TypeScript declaration files for various functions in Lodash, which is a popular JavaScript utility library.\n\nNow, considering the context: when someone is working on a project using Node.js and tools like npm or yarn, installing packages (like Cypress) will automatically create directories under node_modules. During this installation process, it's normal to see multiple files being created as dependencies are extracted and set up.\n\nThe fact that all events are generated by git.exe might seem suspicious at first glance because malware often uses legitimate tools' names to hide its activities. However, in this case, the file paths suggest a standard setup of development tools. The creation of .d.ts files is typical when TypeScript support is added or when certain npm packages are installed that include type definitions.\n\nMoreover, looking for any signs of anomalies: all events occur in the same directory structure, and there's consistency in the naming conventions. There’s no indication of file creation outside expected paths, attempts to access restricted areas, or other behaviors that would raise red flags.\n\nI should also consider if creating multiple files quickly could be a sign of malicious activity, but in this case, it aligns with how package managers work during installation. Each .d.ts file is small and part of the Cypress types, which are legitimate components.\n\nTo ensure I'm not missing something, I'll think about whether git.exe being involved in creating these files is unusual. Since git can be used for more than just version control—like cloning repositories or managing submodules—it's possible that during a setup process, some git operations might create files, but again, the context here seems normal.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious with system logs, especially when dealing with file creations and external tools like git, the pattern observed doesn't suggest malicious activity. It appears to be part of a standard software development environment setup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal file creation activities during the installation or setup of development tools, specifically related to TypeScript and Node.js package dependencies.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each event is in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. Each line represents an event that occurred on the system. The structure of each event includes information about the process, Windows log details, and file information.\n\nLooking at the first event: {\"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\isFinite.d.ts\"}}\nSo, the process name is git.exe. I know that Git is a version control system used for software development. It's common to see Git-related processes on a developer's machine or in a CI\/CD environment.\n\nThe Windows log task indicates that a file was created, specifically under the rule \"FileCreate\". The file path points to a .d.ts file inside a node_modules folder. Node_modules is where npm packages are stored, so this makes sense if someone is working with JavaScript or TypeScript projects using tools like Cypress (as seen in the path).\n\nI notice that each event follows the same pattern: git.exe creating a file in the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash. The filenames vary but all seem to be type definition files for various functions, like isFinite.d.ts, isFunction.d.ts, etc. These are likely part of the Lodash library's type definitions, which is a popular utility library in JavaScript.\n\nLooking at all 18 events, they're all similar—each one creates a different .d.ts file under the same directory structure. The repetition suggests that this is part of a normal build process or installation phase where these type definition files are being created or copied into place. This is typical during development when dependencies are being installed or projects are building.\n\nSince each event involves the creation of a file related to a JavaScript project's type definitions, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious activity here. No signs of unauthorized access, unusual process names, or suspicious file operations like deletion or execution. All activities point towards legitimate software development processes.\n\nMoreover, git.exe is a common and well-known tool, so its presence in the logs isn't alarming on its own. The fact that it's creating multiple files in a predictable location further supports the idea that this is part of normal operations.\n\nI don't see any red flags like attempts to access restricted directories, creation of hidden files, or processes running with elevated privileges. Everything here seems to align with what you'd expect from a developer's environment using tools like Git and Cypress for testing.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, the batch doesn't raise any security concerns. The events are consistent with normal development activities and don't indicate any potential breaches or suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events in question are part of a normal software development process involving the use of Git and npm packages. Each event logs the creation of TypeScript definition files within a project's node_modules directory, which is typical during development or build processes. There are no signs of malicious activity, as all actions align with legitimate operations using common tools like Git and Cypress. Therefore, these events do not pose a security risk.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events is not indicative of any cybersecurity concerns. They represent normal activities associated with software development, specifically the creation of TypeScript definition files during a project's setup or build process. There are no signs of unauthorized access or malicious behavior. \n\n- **Classification:** Not Interesting from a Security Perspective\n- **Confidence Level:** High\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Analysis**: The process name is `git.exe`, which is a standard tool used for version control and commonly associated with software development.\n   \n2. **Log Task Review**: Each event indicates the creation of a file, specifically `.d.ts` files located within the `node_modules` directory, suggesting typical npm package operations.\n\n3. **File Path Analysis**: The file paths point to Lodash type definitions under a Cypress module, which is expected in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects using these tools.\n\n4. **Repetitive Pattern**: The consistent pattern of creating multiple `.d.ts` files supports the idea that this is part of a standard build or installation process rather than malicious activity.\n\n5. **Lack of Red Flags**: No signs of unusual directory access, hidden files, or elevated privileges were present in the logs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events are normal and expected within a development environment, posing no security risks."}

The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. Each entry has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file information.\n\nThe process name in all these events is \"git.exe\". That immediately tells me that the activity is related to Git, which is a version control system commonly used for software development. The task in each event under winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a new file has been created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to specific .d.ts files inside a node_modules directory. For example, one path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\...\", and others follow a similar structure. These paths suggest that the files are part of a Node.js project, specifically under the Cypress framework's type definitions for lodash.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether these events are indicative of malicious behavior or something normal. Since all events involve creating files related to Git and Node modules, it seems like they're part of a standard development process. Developers using tools like Git and Node often create or update files in their project directories during normal operations, such as installing dependencies or working on code.\n\nI don't see any unusual patterns here, like multiple failed login attempts, access to restricted areas, or changes in system-level files. Instead, these are straightforward file creation events within a user's project directory. The fact that they're all under the same process and path reinforces the idea that this is routine activity.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency of these events. If there were an unusual number of file creations beyond what's expected during normal operations, it might raise suspicion. However, in this case, each event seems isolated and related to specific files within a known project structure.\n\nI also think about whether Git.exe could be used maliciously. While it's possible for attackers to misuse legitimate tools, without additional context like unusual network traffic or file hashes, there's no evidence here that git.exe is being exploited. The files created are type definitions, which are standard in TypeScript projects and don't pose a security risk on their own.\n\nIn summary, each event appears to be part of a developer's routine workflow, installing or updating project dependencies using Node.js tools. There's nothing in the logs provided that suggests malicious activity or a breach. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by Git.exe during development, specifically within a Node.js project's dependencies.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 20\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events here. Each event is a JSON object with some details about file creation events on a Windows system. All the events have the same process name, \"git.exe\", and the task is labeled as \"File created\" under the Windows log. The files being created are all in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames like \"matchesProperty.d.ts\", \"max.d.ts\", and so on.\n\nFirst, I'm trying to figure out what these files are. The path includes \"node_modules\" which suggests it's part of a Node.js project. Inside that, there's \"cypress\", which is a testing framework, and \"lodash\", a popular JavaScript library known for its utility functions. These \".d.ts\" files are TypeScript declaration files, which provide type information for TypeScript projects.\n\nNow, considering the process name is \"git.exe\", it's likely that Git is being used here to clone or manage repositories. The fact that multiple files are being created in quick succession might indicate a script or automated process fetching these dependencies as part of building or testing the project.\n\nLooking at each event individually, they all look very similar. Each one is a file creation by git.exe in the same directory but different filenames. Since this is a development environment, it's normal for Git to interact with files during cloning, updating, or checking out branches. The presence of node_modules and cypress further supports that this is related to a software development project.\n\nI'm trying to see if there's anything unusual here. All the events are in the same process, same task, same directory structure. They don't show any signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The files being created are standard for a Node.js project setup with Cypress and Lodash dependencies.\n\nAnother thing I'm considering is whether these file creations could be part of an attack vector. For example, creating many files quickly might be indicative of something like a directory traversal attempt or a file injection attack. However, in this case, all the paths are under a legitimate-looking development directory, and there's no evidence of writing to unexpected locations outside the project scope.\n\nAlso, since it's Git performing these operations, it's more likely related to version control activities rather than malicious processes. If an attacker wanted to hide malicious files, they'd probably use more stealthy methods or create files in less obvious locations.\n\nI'm also thinking about how to determine if this is normal behavior for the system. If this is a development machine where projects are frequently cloned or updated, seeing multiple file creations by Git would be expected. The number of events here—18 in total—is significant but might still fall within normal operations if it's part of a large repository checkout.\n\nAnother angle is to check if these files are being accessed or modified after creation. If there's no further activity on these files, especially from other processes, that could raise suspicions. But in this case, the events stop at file creation, which aligns with Git's role in checking out files without necessarily executing them immediately.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of log injection attacks where logs are manipulated to appear benign, but since each event is consistent and the paths make sense within a development context, that seems less likely.\n\nIn summary, all these events fit the profile of a typical development environment using Git for version control, Node.js with dependencies like Cypress and Lodash. There's no evidence pointing towards malicious activity; instead, it appears to be standard operational behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events represents normal file creation activities in a software development context. Here's a concise summary:\n\n- **Process**: All events are triggered by \"git.exe\", indicating version control operations.\n- **Files Created**: These are TypeScript declaration files for Lodash utilities within a Node.js project using Cypress for testing.\n- **Environment**: The activity occurs in a development environment, likely during the setup or update of a project.\n- **Conclusion**: This is standard operational behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Final Assessment**: The events are normal and consistent with typical software development workflows involving Git, Node.js, and related tools. No signs of cyber threats detected."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation.

The process name is git.exe, which is commonly used for version control in software development. The task in each event is \"File created\", so it's a file creation event. The paths all point to TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) within the node_modules directory of a Cypress project.\n\nI need to consider if these events indicate malicious behavior or something unusual that would require investigation. Typically, when developers work with Node.js and npm packages like Cypress, they interact with node_modules regularly. Installing or updating dependencies can cause many file operations, including creating new files in node_modules.\n\nLooking at the paths, each event is creating a single file, all under the cypress\/types\/lodash directory. The filenames are standard for Lodash's type definitions. This suggests that these might be part of installing or updating the lodash package within Cypress, which is a common practice.\n\nI should check if there are any red flags. For example, multiple file creations in unusual locations or patterns could indicate malicious activity. However, here all files are under a standard development directory, and each event creates one file at a time, which aligns with normal software build processes.\n\nAnother consideration is the frequency of these events. If they occurred over a short period or involved different processes, it might raise suspicion. But since they're all from git.exe and sequential in nature, it seems consistent with a script running during development.\n\nI should also think about whether file creation events are typically monitored for security. While unusual patterns can be red flags, normal development activities like installing dependencies don't usually require investigation unless there's an indicator of compromise (IOC) present.\n\nIn this case, without any indicators of malicious activity such as writes to unexpected locations, execution of scripts, or access to sensitive data, these events seem benign.
