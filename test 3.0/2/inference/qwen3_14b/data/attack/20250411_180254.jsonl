{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to analyze these log entries to see if there's anything suspicious going on. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, right? Browsers often query DNS. Then powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry events. Hmm, but then there's a cmd.exe command line that runs systeminfo and reg query on the Disk Enum key. That might be checking disk information, maybe part of a legitimate system check, but could also be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThen there's systeminfo.exe being run, which is normal. But then it loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's okay. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. So that seems legitimate. \n\nNotepad.exe and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for internet-related functions. Maybe not suspicious. \n\nsvchost.exe creating event logs (Parameters.evtx and State.evtx). That's part of normal system logging, I think. But then there's a reg.exe querying the same Disk Enum key again. \n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is running with a command line that includes -secured and -Embedding. That might be normal for WMI, but sometimes these can be exploited. However, the image loaded is wmiutils.dll, which is a legitimate file.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which might be less secure. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: there are several registry queries and process creations, but most of the processes are legitimate system tools. The only thing that stands out a bit is the reg query on Disk Enum, which could be part of checking hardware, but not necessarily malicious. The presence of multiple registry events and process accesses might indicate some level of system probing, but without additional indicators like unusual network activity, unexpected file modifications, or privilege escalation, it's hard to classify this as malicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple registry accesses, process creations, and the use of tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe could be part of a larger attack. But in the absence of clear malicious activities like downloading payloads, executing suspicious scripts, or accessing sensitive files, it's more likely benign. \n\nSo, maybe this is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The activities are consistent with normal system operations and legitimate tools. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's not enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events reflect standard system operations (e.g., DNS queries, registry access, process creation) using legitimate tools (chrome.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe). No clear malicious indicators like unexpected network activity, suspicious file modifications, or anomalous privilege use are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of events where the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" associated with chrome.exe. There are multiple instances of this, which might be normal if chrome is updating its settings, but maybe not. However, there's also an event where chrome.exe loads an image, specifically amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. But why is chrome.exe loading it? That might be suspicious because amsi is usually used by antivirus software, and if a legitimate process like chrome is loading it, maybe it's being used to bypass detection. \n\nThen there's another image loaded from the Windows Defender Platform, MpOAV.dll. That one seems more legitimate, as it's part of Windows Defender. But the amsi.dll path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll, which is the correct location. Hmm, but why would chrome need to load amsi? Maybe it's a false positive, but combined with the multiple registry changes, it could indicate something.\n\nAlso, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be normal if they're setting up monitoring. Then a file created by powershell.exe, which isn't immediately suspicious unless there's something in the file. But the file is named objeto_padrao.txt, which seems generic. \n\nLooking at the overall pattern: a lot of registry changes by chrome.exe. If chrome is modifying registry values, that's not typical. Usually, chrome doesn't change registry keys unless there's an extension or some configuration. But multiple events could indicate an attempt to modify system settings. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe combination of registry modifications and loading amsi.dll might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hook into amsi to disable scanning. But the presence of a legitimate defender DLL might be a coincidence. \n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The winlogbeat file creation is probably normal. The powershell-created text file isn't clearly malicious. \n\nSo, the main points are: multiple registry changes by chrome, which is unusual, and loading amsi.dll from chrome. These could be signs of a malicious activity, like an exploit or a tampering attempt. However, without more data, like the specific registry keys or other anomalies, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say it's moderately suspicious. Maybe around 0.6. It's not a clear-cut case, but the combination of events might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes are modifying registry values (RegistryEvent) and loading amsi.dll, which is unusual for a browser. This could indicate potential tampering or evasion techniques, though further analysis is needed to confirm malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
