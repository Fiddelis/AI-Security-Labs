So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe is doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe with a registry value set. Registry changes can be normal, but combined with other events, maybe not.\n\nLooking further, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with a command line that starts a script. The command line has a path that seems a bit odd with multiple backslashes and dots. Maybe that's a red flag. Then, there are several image loaded events for .NET DLLs, which might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require those libraries. But then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common in malware to avoid leaving traces, but it could also be a legitimate script cleaning up after itself.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be normal, but the multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events with various script paths could indicate something. The paths have patterns like \"..\\\\..\\\\..\" which might be trying to access parent directories, possibly to hide the actual script location. Also, the fact that there are multiple Start-Process commands in different paths might suggest automated or malicious activity.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe changing the registry is another point. While some registry changes are normal, if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities, creating and deleting files, loading various DLLs, and registry changes. While some of these could be legitimate, the combination, especially the file creation and deletion in Temp and the multiple script executions with complex paths, raises suspicion. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing scripts with suspicious paths (e.g., '..\\\\..\\\\'), creating\/deleting temporary files, and loading .NET DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at all the events together and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the processes mentioned. There's a lot of chrome.exe and powershell.exe activities. Chrome is a common browser, but having multiple registry value set events might not be normal. Then there's Calculator.exe, which is usually benign, but maybe not a red flag on its own.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries, one of them has a command line that starts a process with a path that seems a bit odd: \"C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" might indicate trying to navigate up directories, which could be a sign of attempting to access files outside the intended path. That seems suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows a file created at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\componente_principal.txt\" by powershell.exe. Creating files in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be worth looking into.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe. While Chrome might modify its own registry settings, the high frequency here could be unusual. Also, some image loaded events point to system files like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, which are part of Windows' security features. If these are being loaded in an unexpected context, that might be a problem.\n\nThe presence of ProcessAccess events and ImageLoad events might indicate that processes are interacting with each other in ways that aren't typical. For example, the chrome.exe loading amsi.dll is normal, but if there's an unusual interaction, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nHowever, there's also a lot of normal activity, like the svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory, which is part of Windows' built-in features. So not everything here is necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of unusual file paths, multiple registry changes, and the use of PowerShell for executing scripts might indicate a potential security incident. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the suspicious elements are enough to warrant further investigation. So I'd lean towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlighted:**\n1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution Path:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a script with a path containing `..\\\\` (directory traversal):  \n     `C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat`  \n     This may indicate an attempt to access files outside the intended directory, potentially for obfuscation or lateral movement.\n\n2. **File Creation in User Downloads Folder:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process created a file at:  \n     `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\componente_principal.txt`  \n     While not inherently malicious, this could be part of data exfiltration or persistence if tied to other events.\n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` processes triggered `Registry value set` events. While Chrome may modify its own registry, excessive or unusual changes could indicate tampering or configuration manipulation.\n\n4. **Loading of System DLLs:**\n   - `chrome.exe` loaded `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components). While normal in some contexts, this could be an attempt to bypass security features (e.g., hooking or disabling AMSI).\n\n### **Normal Activity:**\n- **Legitimate Processes:**  \n  - `svchost.exe` creating files in `C:\\\\Windows\\\\ServiceProfiles\\\\NetworkService\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\DeliveryOptimization\\\\State\\\\` is part of Windows' built-in Delivery Optimization feature.  \n  - `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` interacting with the registry is typical for user-initiated commands.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe batch contains **potential indicators of compromise** (e.g., suspicious file paths, registry modifications, and unusual process interactions). While not definitive proof of malicious activity, these patterns warrant further investigation, such as:  \n- Correlating timestamps with user activity or external network traffic.  \n- Analyzing the contents of created files (e.g., `componente_principal.txt`).  \n- Checking for anomalies in registry key modifications.  \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** due to the combination of suspicious behavior and legitimate activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries. Each line is a separate event. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are seven entries where the process is chrome.exe, and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\", with file being None. Then there's an entry with winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory, and another with powershell.exe creating elemento_base.txt.\n\nHmm, chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. That's a bit unusual because Chrome is a common application, but modifying the registry could be part of normal operations. However, if it's happening multiple times in quick succession, maybe that's suspicious. But the logs don't show any errors or unusual parameters, just the task being \"Registry value set\". \n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log collector, so maybe it's just doing its job. The path is in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for such files. The file name is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary file during configuration. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creating elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. Unless there's more context, like the file being created with malicious content or in an unusual location. The path here is also in the Downloads folder, which is normal for user-created files.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The majority are chrome.exe registry changes, which might be normal if the user is using Chrome. However, the repetition of the same event seven times might indicate something. But without more info, like different registry keys or unexpected values, it's hard to say. The other two events are about file creation by legitimate processes. \n\nBut wait, could there be a pattern here? If winlogbeat is creating a config file, and PowerShell is creating a text file, maybe they're part of a setup or a script. However, the chrome.exe events are all the same. Maybe a benign process, but repeated events could be a red flag. However, without additional indicators like high frequency, unusual registry keys, or other malicious activities, it's not conclusive.\n\nThe justification would be that there's no clear malicious activity. The events are either normal operations (Chrome, Winlogbeat, PowerShell) or lack sufficient context to indicate a threat. So the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, since there's no obvious attack vector or suspicious behavior detected in the provided logs.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal process activities (chrome.exe registry modifications, winlogbeat file creation, and PowerShell text file creation) without suspicious patterns, anomalies, or indicators of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
