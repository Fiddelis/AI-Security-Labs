{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. The 'cmd.exe' entries have some commands that stand out. For example, one of them is using 'sc create' to set up a service with a command that starts a non-existing PowerShell script. The path mentioned is 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and another one 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The fact that the scripts are non-existing might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute something that isn't there, which could be a red flag. Maybe they're trying to create a service that runs a malicious script, but the script doesn't exist yet, so it's not executing. Or perhaps it's a typo, but that's less likely.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'sc.exe' to create a service. Creating a service can be part of persistence mechanisms. The command line for 'sc.exe' includes setting the binPath to execute a command that starts a PowerShell script. Even though the script isn't found, the attempt to create such a service is suspicious. Also, there are multiple entries of 'Registry value set' events, which might indicate changes to the registry for persistence or configuration changes. Processes like 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are involved in registry events, which could be normal, but combined with other activities, it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThere are also 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll', which is a legitimate DLL, but loading it might not be suspicious on its own. However, if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a problem. The 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably just part of the log collection, so that's likely benign.\n\nLooking at the sequence of events, there's a pattern of creating a service, attempting to run scripts that don't exist, and modifying the registry. This could be part of an attack where the attacker is trying to set up persistence, maybe after initial access. The repeated 'Registry value set' events might be modifying keys to ensure the malicious service starts on boot or to hide the service. The use of 'cmd.exe' and 'sc.exe' to create services is a common technique in malware for persistence.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack here. The scripts aren't found, so maybe the attacker is testing or the logs are from a failed attempt. But the combination of creating a service, modifying the registry, and using PowerShell and cmd.exe in a way that's not typical for normal user activity could still be interesting. The presence of multiple 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell might indicate that it's being used to execute commands, which is common but could be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The 'whoami' or other commands aren't listed here, but the service creation and registry changes are. The fact that the service is pointing to non-existent scripts might be a mistake, but it's also possible that the attacker is trying to plant a script later. Alternatively, the attacker might have intended to use a different path that was mistyped.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, the combination of creating a service with a non-existent script, multiple registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe in a way that's indicative of persistence mechanisms makes this log entry worth investigating further. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but the patterns are suspicious enough to warrant attention.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though they do not definitively confirm a malicious activity. Key indicators include:\n\n### 1. **Service Creation with Non-Existent Scripts**\n   - **`sc create` commands** attempt to establish services with paths pointing to non-existent PowerShell scripts (e.g., `c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1`). While the scripts are not found, this could indicate:\n     - **Persistence attempts**: The attacker may be trying to create a service for later execution (e.g., after deploying the script).\n     - **Mistyping or testing**: The absence of the files might be accidental, but the attempt to create a service is still unusual for normal user behavior.\n\n### 2. **Registry Modifications**\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events involve processes like `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `Calculator.exe`. This could signal:\n     - **Persistence or configuration changes**: Modifying registry keys to ensure the malicious service starts on boot or to hide the service.\n     - **Legitimate activity**: However, the frequency and context (e.g., `Calculator.exe` modifying the registry) are atypical and merit closer scrutiny.\n\n### 3. **Abuse of PowerShell and CMD**\n   - **`powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`** are repeatedly invoked, often in ways that align with attack techniques:\n     - **PowerShell for command execution**: Common in both legitimate and malicious contexts, but paired with service creation, it raises concerns.\n     - **CMD for service manipulation**: The use of `sc.exe` to create services is a known persistence method in malware.\n\n### 4. **Image Load Events**\n   - **`urlmon.dll`** is loaded by `Calculator.exe` and `Calculator.exe` itself. While `urlmon.dll` is a legitimate component, its loading in this context (e.g., by a process named `Calculator.exe`) is not inherently suspicious but could be part of a broader anomalous behavior.\n\n### 5. **Benign Activity**\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a file in the Downloads directory is likely part of log collection and is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **potential signs of persistence setup** (e.g., service creation, registry changes) and **unusual process behavior** (e.g., `Calculator.exe` modifying the registry). While the absence of the targeted scripts may indicate a failed attempt or a typo, the combination of these events is **sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation**. Analysts should:\n- Check for additional logs related to the missing scripts.\n- Correlate these events with user behavior, network activity, and other system logs.\n- Investigate the source of the `sc.exe` and registry modification commands to determine legitimacy.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for further investigation** due to potential persistence mechanisms and anomalous process behavior."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' being used. PowerShell is common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. There's an entry where 'cmd.exe' is used with 'sc' commands to create a service named 'MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS'. That seems unusual because creating a service with that name might be part of setting up a backdoor or something malicious. Also, the service is set to start automatically, which is suspicious.\n\nThen there's the 'svchost.exe' process loading 'urlmon.dll' and 'amsi.dll'. Wait, 'amsi.dll' is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. But if it's being loaded by a suspicious process, that could be an attempt to bypass detection. However, in the logs, 'chrome.exe' is loading 'amsi.dll', which might be normal depending on the context. But I need to check if there's any other unusual activity.\n\nAnother point is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file could be normal, but the name '.winlogbeat.yml.new' might be part of a setup. However, there's no immediate indication of malicious activity here unless there's something else.\n\nLooking at the 'sc' command again, creating a service with 'MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS' might be a red flag. That service name is typically associated with SQL Server, but if it's being created in an unexpected context, like by a user who isn't an administrator, that's suspicious. The logs don't show the user context, but the presence of that command alone is worth noting.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events for 'chrome.exe'. While Chrome might modify the registry for updates or extensions, a high number of such events could indicate tampering. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' and 'amsi.dll' are part of normal operations, but if they're being loaded by processes that shouldn't be using them, that's a problem. The logs don't show any obvious signs of that, though.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the 'sc' command creating a service. That could be part of a malicious activity, like setting up a persistence mechanism. Even though there are other events, that one stands out as potentially malicious. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Service Creation via `sc` Command**\n- **Log Example**:  \n  ```json\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Command line (rule: CommandLine)'}\",\"file\":\"{'command_line': 'sc create MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS binPath= \\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs\\\" start= auto'}\"}\n  ```\n- **Risk**:  \n  - The `sc create` command is being used to **create a service named `MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS`** with `svchost.exe` as the executable.  \n  - This is highly unusual because `MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS` is typically associated with **Microsoft SQL Server**, not `svchost.exe` (a core Windows process).  \n  - **Persistence Mechanism**: The service is configured to start automatically (`start= auto`), which could indicate an attempt to **establish persistence** on the system.  \n  - **Potential Malicious Use**: `svchost.exe` being used for this purpose may be a **red flag** for **malware伪装 (masquerading)** as a legitimate service.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Multiple `Registry value set` Events for `chrome.exe`**\n- **Log Examples**:  \n  ```json\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n  ```\n- **Risk**:  \n  - **High Frequency**: There are **12+ registry modification events** for `chrome.exe` alone.  \n  - **Unusual Behavior**: While Chrome may modify the registry for updates or extensions, **excessive or unexpected registry changes** could indicate **tampering** or **malware activity**.  \n  - **Need for Context**: Further analysis (e.g., checking the specific registry keys modified) is required to determine legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **3. `Image loaded` Events for `urlmon.dll` and `amsi.dll`**\n- **Log Examples**:  \n  ```json\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'Calculator.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\urlmon.dll'}\"}\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\amsi.dll'}\"}\n  ```\n- **Risk**:  \n  - **`urlmon.dll`**: A legitimate Windows component for handling URLs. However, if loaded by unexpected processes (e.g., `Calculator.exe`), it may indicate **malware** or **exploitation**.  \n  - **`amsi.dll`**: Part of **Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface**. If loaded by non-antimalware processes, it may indicate **attempts to bypass detection** (e.g., malware trying to disable AMSI).  \n  - **Context Needed**: Confirm if these processes are legitimate and if the modules are being loaded from expected paths.\n\n---\n\n### **4. `winlogbeat.exe` File Creation**\n- **Log Example**:  \n  ```json\n  {\"process\":\"{'name': 'winlogbeat.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreation)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Downloads\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'}\"}\n  ```\n- **Risk**:  \n  - **Legitimate Use**: `winlogbeat.exe` is a **log shipper** used for monitoring and shipping logs.  \n  - **Potential Concern**: The file name `.winlogbeat.yml.new` suggests a **configuration file** being created. While this could be part of a **setup process**, ensure it is **initiated by an authorized user** and **not part of a malicious configuration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Key Suspicious Activity**:  \n  - The **`sc create MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS`** command is the most critical red flag. It suggests **unauthorized service creation** with potential **malware persistence**.  \n- **Recommended Actions**:  \n  1. **Investigate the `sc` command** further (e.g., check the source of the command, user context, and service details).  \n  2. **Analyze registry changes** for `chrome.exe` to determine legitimacy.  \n  3. **Verify the integrity** of `urlmon.dll` and `amsi.dll` modules loaded by unexpected processes.  \n  4. **Monitor the `winlogbeat.exe` file** to ensure it is part of a legitimate configuration.  \n\nThis log warrants **urgent investigation** due to the potential for **malware persistence or unauthorized system modification**."}
