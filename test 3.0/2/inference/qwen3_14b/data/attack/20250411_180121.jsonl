{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are related to Chrome and PowerShell processes. The Chrome entries are about DNS queries and network connections, which are normal activities. However, the PowerShell entries are more suspicious. There's a PowerShell command that downloads a file from a GitHub URL using WebClient's DownloadFile method. That seems like a common technique used in malicious scripts to fetch payloads.\n\nWait, there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes downloading files from different GitHub repositories. Each time, they're saving the file to the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because downloading files from external sources, especially using PowerShell, can be part of an attack chain. Also, the fact that there are several such events might indicate that the system is being used to execute multiple scripts or that there's an ongoing attempt to exfiltrate data or install malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to image loading, like loading clr.dll and other .NET assemblies. While those are legitimate system files, the combination with the PowerShell activities could be part of a larger malicious activity. The logs also show file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory, which might be an attempt to clean up after executing the downloaded scripts.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these activities could be benign. For example, downloading a LICENSE.txt file from GitHub might be part of a legitimate software development process. But the repeated use of PowerShell for such downloads, especially with different repositories, increases the suspicion. Also, the presence of multiple image load events and registry modifications might indicate that the system is being manipulated in ways that aren't typical for normal user activity.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, which might be related to Windows Defender or other security software, but the combination with the other events could be significant. The fact that the same user (fiddelis) is involved in creating and deleting files in the TEMP directory might indicate a pattern of behavior that's not normal.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch of logs does show several suspicious activities that are indicative of potential malicious behavior. Even though some individual events could be benign, the overall pattern suggests that further investigation is warranted. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.8, as there's a strong indication of potential malicious activity without being 100% certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub repositories using WebClient.DownloadFile, which is a common technique in malware for payload delivery.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe executing commands that download files from GitHub. The command lines use WebClient's DownloadFile method to get LICENSE.txt files from various repositories. While GitHub is a legitimate source, downloading files to temporary directories might be a red flag. But wait, the filenames are LICENSE.txt, which are common in open-source projects. However, the paths where they're saved are in the TEMP directory, which is often used by malware to store temporary files. \n\nThen there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt and another at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. The first one is in the Downloads folder, which is normal, but the second path is part of PowerShell's startup data. If a malicious script is being loaded here, that could be an issue. But the file name doesn't immediately look malicious.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe. Chrome modifying its own registry might be normal, but if it's done multiple times in quick succession, it could indicate something trying to configure or inject code. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The same goes for the conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe events.\n\nThe Dns query event is just a normal network activity, so that's probably not a concern. The winlogbeat.exe events are about file creation, which is part of the logging software's normal operation. The MpDefenderCoreService.exe has a network connection, which is expected as it's part of Windows Defender.\n\nNow, the key points here are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub. Even though GitHub is legitimate, the use of DownloadFile in PowerShell scripts is often associated with malicious activities, especially if the files are being saved to temporary locations. The fact that there are multiple such events with different URLs might indicate an attempt to download various payloads or scripts. However, the files are named LICENSE.txt, which are usually benign. But attackers can use such names to disguise malicious content.\n\nAnother thing is the file created in the PowerShell startup directory. If that file is being used to execute scripts on startup, that's a potential security risk. But the logs don't show any execution events, just file creation. So it's a possible indicator but not definitive.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs show suspicious activity that might warrant further investigation. The presence of multiple PowerShell downloads from external sources, even if they're from GitHub, combined with file creation in sensitive directories, could be signs of a security threat. However, without more data like the actual content of the downloaded files or further malicious activity, it's not conclusive. But enough to flag it as interesting for a security team to look into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, though no definitive malicious behavior is confirmed. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **PowerShell Download Activity**  \n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands to **download files from GitHub** (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`) using `System.Net.WebClient.DownloadFile`.  \n   - **Temporary File Storage**: Files are saved to the `%TEMP%` directory (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`), a common tactic for malware to avoid detection.  \n   - **GitHub as a Source**: While GitHub is legitimate, the use of `DownloadFile` in PowerShell scripts is often associated with **malicious payloads** (e.g., downloading and executing scripts).  \n\n2. **Unusual File Creation**  \n   - A file is created in the PowerShell startup directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`.  \n     - This could indicate an attempt to **persist execution** or inject code into PowerShell sessions.\n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `RuntimeBroker.exe`.  \n     - While not inherently malicious, repeated modifications could suggest **tampering** or **injection** (e.g., altering registry keys to hijack processes).\n\n4. **Network Activity**  \n   - A `Dns query` event is logged, but no specific domain is listed. If this were tied to a known malicious domain, it would be a stronger indicator.\n\n---\n\n### **Benign or Contextual Activity**\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: The `winlogbeat.exe` process creating `.yml.new` files is part of **log configuration** and likely legitimate.  \n- **Windows Defender Activity**: The `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` network connection is expected for **antivirus operations**.  \n- **Notepad and RuntimeBroker**: These processes are standard and typically not malicious unless tied to other suspicious events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **contain indicators of potential compromise** (e.g., PowerShell downloads to temporary directories, unusual file creation). However, **no conclusive evidence of malicious activity** is present. Further investigation is needed, including:  \n- Analyzing the contents of downloaded files (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`).  \n- Checking for **unauthorized persistence mechanisms** (e.g., startup scripts).  \n- Correlating with **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to detect lateral movement or execution of downloaded payloads.  \n\n**Recommendation**: Flag this activity for **triage by a security analyst** to determine if it represents a false positive or a potential threat."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal since calc.exe is a legitimate process and urlmon.dll is part of Windows. But then there's a lot of svchost.exe and powershell.exe entries. svchost.exe is common, but if there are multiple registry value sets, that might be a red flag. However, svchost is often used by Windows services, so maybe not immediately suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". That's interesting because deleting a task might be part of cleaning up after an attack. Also, there's a reg.exe command deleting a registry key under Run, which could be removing persistence mechanisms. That's a common tactic by attackers to avoid detection.\n\nAnother entry shows a cmd.exe process running SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F. Deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" could indicate that an attacker had previously created a task with that name to execute malicious code. Removing it might be an attempt to erase their tracks.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign, but if it's being called frequently, maybe in conjunction with other commands, it could be part of reconnaissance. However, alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nThe repetition of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events might indicate someone trying to manipulate the registry or execute scripts. But PowerShell is a common tool, so without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe key points here are the deletion of the scheduled task \"spawn\" and the deletion of a registry key in the Run section. These actions are typically associated with post-exploitation activities where an attacker removes evidence of their presence. Additionally, the use of reg.exe and cmd.exe for registry modifications could be part of that process.\n\nPutting this all together, the logs show activity that's trying to remove scheduled tasks and registry entries, which are signs of an attacker trying to clean up after themselves. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these actions is suspicious and warrants further investigation. So, yes, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **suspicious activity** indicative of **post-exploitation behavior** and **evidence removal** by an attacker. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Deletion**  \n   - **`cmd.exe`** executing:  \n     `REG DELETE \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" \/V \"modulo_temporario\" \/f`  \n     `SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F`  \n   - **Implication**: The attacker is **removing a scheduled task** (`spawn`) and a **registry-run key** (`modulo_temporario`), likely to erase persistence mechanisms (e.g., malicious payloads or backdoors) that were previously installed.\n\n2. **Registry Manipulation**  \n   - Multiple entries of **`cmd.exe`**, **`reg.exe`**, and **`conhost.exe`** modifying or deleting registry keys under `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`.  \n   - **Implication**: This suggests the attacker is **removing registry-based persistence** (e.g., autorun entries), a common tactic to avoid detection after initial access.\n\n3. **Frequent Use of `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe`**  \n   - **`whoami.exe`** is used to check user context (e.g., privilege escalation), while **`powershell.exe`** is frequently accessed.  \n   - **Implication**: PowerShell is often used for **post-exploitation tasks** (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration). Its repeated access may indicate **script-based attacks** or **tool usage**.\n\n4. **`conhost.exe` and `svchost.exe` Anomalies**  \n   - **`conhost.exe`** (console host) and **`svchost.exe`** (Windows service host) are legitimate but often abused by attackers for **obfuscation** or **malicious payload execution**. Their pairing with registry edits raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- **Evidence of Cleanup**: The deletion of scheduled tasks and registry keys suggests the attacker is **erasing their footprint** after compromising the system.\n- **Persistence Removal**: The focus on `Run` keys and `SCHTASKS` indicates the attacker may have previously established **persistent access** (e.g., through malicious scripts or backdoors).\n- **Lateral Movement\/Privilege Escalation**: The use of `whoami.exe` and PowerShell hints at **reconnaissance** or **exploitation of elevated privileges**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check System Logs**: Look for prior events related to the creation of the `spawn` task or `modulo_temporario` registry key.\n2. **Analyze File Integrity**: Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **SIEM** to detect unauthorized changes to system files or registry.\n3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Investigate if PowerShell or `cmd.exe` was used to exfiltrate data.\n4. **Check for Malware**: Scan the system for indicators of compromise (e.g., `modulo_temporario`-related files, unusual binaries).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log batch shows **clear signs of post-exploitation activity**, including **evidence removal** and **registry manipulation**, which are strong indicators of a **compromised system**. Further forensic analysis is warranted.  \n\n**Verdict**: ✅ **Interesting for investigation** (high risk of compromise)."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are related to powershell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain activities, it can be a red flag. Let me check the winlog tasks. There's a lot of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events, which might be normal, but I should check for any unusual patterns.\n\nWait, there's a 'File created' event with a temporary file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Then, immediately after, there's a 'File Delete logged' event for the same file. That's interesting because creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces. But why would it be named PSScriptPolicyTest? Maybe it's a legitimate test, but the quick deletion might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them isn't unusual. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might indicate that the system is scanning or responding to something, but that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events. These could be part of normal operations, but if combined with other activities, they might suggest configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be related to inter-process communication, which is normal, but again, in combination with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, the key point here is the creation and immediate deletion of the PowerShell script file. This pattern is often seen in malware trying to execute scripts without leaving evidence. The fact that the file is in the Temp directory and is deleted right after could be a sign of an attempt to hide malicious activity. But I should also consider that it could be a legitimate script test, especially if the user is running PowerShell scripts for testing purposes.\n\nBut considering the rest of the logs don't show other obvious malicious activities, and the majority of events are related to normal PowerShell operations and .NET components, the confidence level might be moderate. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of a security incident. So the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process events include a temporary script file creation and immediate deletion (likely attempting to execute and clean up evidence), along with repeated lifecycle events that may indicate automated or suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

First, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. That's typical, not suspicious. Then there are several instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed. PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used in certain ways, like executing scripts or modifying the registry, it can be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a lot of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent entries related to PowerShell. The command line for one of the PowerShell processes is \"powershell.exe & {}\", which is a bit odd. The empty script might be a way to bypass execution policies or test something. Also, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them is normal, but maybe in this context, it's part of some malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. The file is created and then immediately deleted. That could be part of a script that's executed temporarily, which is common in both benign and malicious scenarios. However, the fact that it's in the Temp directory and the name is generic might not be enough on its own.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated use of PowerShell with ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. If this is part of a legitimate script, it might be expected, but if it's part of an attack, like trying to modify the registry to persist or change settings, that's a concern. However, without more context, like unusual registry keys being modified or network activity, it's hard to say.\n\nI also see ApplicationFrameHost.exe involved in a RegistryEvent. That's a Windows process, usually related to hosting applications, so that might be normal. The rest of the events are either PowerShell or whoami, which are standard tools.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch has a mix of normal system processes and PowerShell activities. The presence of temporary files and multiple registry events could indicate something, but without more evidence like unusual commands, network connections, or persistence mechanisms, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the high frequency of PowerShell events and the deletion of a script file might warrant further investigation. The confidence here is moderate, maybe around 0.65.

PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's doing a lot of these actions, it might be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's chrome.exe doing similar things. But Chrome is a browser, so maybe it's normal for it to interact with the registry or create pipes. However, the number of events related to chrome.exe is quite high—multiple registry value sets. That might be unusual. \n\nThen, there's a process with command_line: powershell.exe & {}—empty command? That seems odd. Maybe a placeholder or a failed attempt. Also, the engine lifecycle events might be part of some automated process, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably okay. But then, there's a File created in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store things, so that's a point to note. \n\nLooking at the command lines, one entry has Remove-Item on a zip file in the temp directory. That's a normal operation, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe it's cleaning up after something. \n\nThere are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so if PowerShell is loading them, that's expected when running .NET scripts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a powershell.exe process loading the MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe not suspicious. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. But then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be part of normal operations, like temporary script execution. However, the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be a red flag. \n\nNext, there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing Remove-Item commands on various .zip and .txt files in the Temp directory. The command lines show that they're trying to remove these files, which might be part of cleanup, but the repetition of this across different files could indicate something. Also, the use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests they don't want any errors to be reported if the files aren't there. \n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event, which might be normal, but not sure. The chrome.exe events involve loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate, but also some registry changes. However, the main focus seems to be on PowerShell activities.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the repeated removal of files from the Temp directory might be part of a larger operation. Maybe the attacker is trying to clean up after executing some scripts. The fact that the same script names are used multiple times could indicate that they're part of a larger attack, like deploying malware or exfiltrating data. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or exploitation attempts. The PowerShell commands are all about file removal, which could be part of a legitimate process. But the pattern of creating and deleting files, along with multiple Remove-Item commands, might be indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The presence of multiple file deletions and creations, especially in Temp directories, could be suspicious. However, without more context, like other events indicating exploitation or unauthorized access, it's hard to say. The confidence level might be medium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is just normal system behavior. For example, scripts might be temporarily created and then deleted. But the repetition and the specific use of PowerShell for these actions might still be worth investigating. So, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 to 0.7. The justification would be the repeated file deletions and creations in Temp directories using PowerShell, which could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents **moderate suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Interest**:\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell` directory and later deleted. While temporary files are common, the **creation-deletion pattern** could indicate **cleanup after execution** of a script or **obfuscation** of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Repeated File Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n   - Multiple `Remove-Item` commands target `.zip` and `.txt` files in the Temp directory (e.g., `tarefa_base.txt`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`). The use of `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` suggests **intentional suppression of errors**, which is often seen in **malicious scripts** attempting to avoid detection during cleanup.\n\n3. **PowerShell Process Access**:\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe` could indicate **inter-process communication** or **exploitation of PowerShell for lateral movement**. However, without additional context (e.g., unexpected parent processes or network activity), this remains inconclusive.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Several `Registry value set` events for `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are logged. While registry changes are normal, the **lack of context** (e.g., specific keys modified) makes it hard to assess risk.\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**:\n- **MpOAV.dll and amsi.dll** are legitimate Windows Defender components. Their loading by `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` is **not inherently suspicious**.\n- **`whoami.exe` execution** is a standard diagnostic tool and not indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe **repeated file deletions in Temp directories**, combined with **PowerShell process access** and **script creation-deletion cycles**, suggest **potential cleanup or obfuscation** of malicious activity. However, **no direct evidence of exploitation or data exfiltration** is present. \n\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING** (moderate risk)  \n**Confidence**: 0.65  \n**Recommendation**: Investigate further by correlating these events with **network traffic logs**, **process parentage**, and **file content analysis** (if available)."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is running a command to remove a file in the TEMP directory. That's a common tactic for malware to clean up after itself. Then there are multiple entries of powershell.exe loading various DLLs, some related to .NET and Windows Defender. Loading a lot of system DLLs might be normal, but combined with other actions, it could be a sign of something.\n\nNext, there are several instances of FileCreate and FileDelete events. For example, a file is created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That's suspicious because it might be trying to execute a script and then remove evidence. Also, the command lines involve removing temporary files, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if it's part of monitoring. But the presence of multiple PowerShell events and the deletion of files might indicate something else.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, they all use Remove-Item on TEMP files. That's a red flag because attackers often use TEMP directories to store temporary files and then delete them to avoid detection. The repetition of similar commands across different files suggests a pattern.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, which might be part of normal operations, but when combined with file creation and deletion, it could indicate a script is being executed and then cleaned up. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be a way to bypass detection, but I'm not sure. \n\nAnother point is the use of \"ErrorAction Ignore\" in the commands. That's a common PowerShell trick to suppress errors, which is often used in malicious scripts to avoid alerting the user.\n\nHowever, there's also a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. But in this context, if it's part of a sequence of actions that include file manipulation and registry changes, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, the repeated file deletions and PowerShell activity could be malicious. On the other hand, some of these actions might be part of legitimate scripts or system processes. But the pattern of creating and deleting files in TEMP, combined with multiple PowerShell commands that suppress errors, leans towards being suspicious. The presence of Winlogbeat might be a false positive, but the overall pattern is more indicative of an attack. So, I think this warrants further investigation, hence the \"interesting\" classification.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, as they align with behaviors commonly associated with adversarial activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing `Remove-Item` on files in the `%TEMP%` directory (e.g., `pacote_ativo.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`). This is a classic tactic to execute malicious payloads (e.g., scripts) and then erase evidence.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\objeto_padrao.txt\n     ```\n\n2. **Suppressed Error Handling**:\n   - Commands use `-ErrorAction Ignore` to suppress errors, a common technique to avoid alerting users or systems during cleanup phases.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Frequent `ProcessCreate`, `ProcessAccess`, and `Registry value set` events involving PowerShell suggest attempts to manipulate system state or execute scripts.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     whoami.exe (legitimate) but paired with suspicious file operations.\n     ```\n\n4. **Loading of System DLLs**:\n   - PowerShell loads multiple system DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender). While not inherently malicious, this could indicate an attempt to bypass detection or interact with security software.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - A file is created in a download directory (`winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`). While Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper, the context of other suspicious events raises questions about its role here.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Hypothesis**\n- **Malicious Script Execution**: The logs may represent a multi-stage attack where:\n  - A malicious script is temporarily written to `%TEMP%`.\n  - The script is executed (via PowerShell).\n  - The script and its artifacts are deleted to avoid detection.\n- **Persistence or Privilege Escalation**: The use of `whoami.exe` and registry modifications could hint at attempts to escalate privileges or establish persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for additional PowerShell commands, network activity, or lateral movement indicators (e.g., SMB, RDP connections).\n   - Investigate the `winlogbeat` file for tampering or unexpected configuration changes.\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - If the deleted files (e.g., `objeto_padrao.txt`) were recovered, analyze their contents for malicious code (e.g., PowerShell scripts, payloads).\n\n3. **Monitor User Behavior**:\n   - Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) has elevated privileges or unusual access patterns.\n\n4. **Check for Known Indicators**:\n   - Cross-reference the observed behavior with threat intelligence feeds for known malicious scripts or tooling.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs are **highly suspicious** and merit immediate investigation. The combination of file creation\/deletion, error suppression, and PowerShell-centric activity strongly suggests adversarial behavior. While some components (e.g., `whoami.exe`, Winlogbeat) are legitimate, their context here raises red flags. Further analysis is required to confirm whether this represents a genuine threat. \n\n**Classification**: **Interesting (High Priority)**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking at the events. There are a bunch of entries with chrome.exe doing registry value sets. That's a lot, but maybe normal if someone is using Chrome a lot. But then there's RuntimeBroker.exe also doing registry changes. That might be a red flag because RuntimeBroker is usually associated with UAC prompts or app permissions, so maybe that's normal, but I should check.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe with Process accessed events. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. But the fact that it's being accessed multiple times might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Then there's whoami.exe being executed several times. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably normal unless it's part of a larger attack pattern.\n\nWait, but looking at the file events, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably part of normal monitoring. However, there's also a file created by powershell.exe named \"pacote_ativo.txt\" in the Downloads folder. That's a bit suspicious. The name doesn't seem to be a standard file, and being created via PowerShell might indicate data exfiltration or some malicious activity. But without knowing what's in the file, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from Chrome and PowerShell, which could be normal. However, the repeated registry changes by RuntimeBroker and the creation of a file via PowerShell might be worth investigating. Also, the presence of whoami.exe multiple times could be part of an attack chain. But I need to check if these are part of a known benign activity. Since there's no clear evidence of a security incident, but some anomalies, maybe the classification is interesting but with moderate confidence. However, if the file \"pacote_ativo.txt\" is something malicious, that's a flag. But without more info, I can't be sure. Maybe the confidence is around 0.65. The justification would be the combination of multiple registry changes and file creation via PowerShell.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, combined with frequent PowerShell activity and file creation in user directories, suggest potential malicious behavior or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
