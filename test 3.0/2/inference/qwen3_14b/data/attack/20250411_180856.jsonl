{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple chrome.exe instances doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's a cmd.exe running a command to create a notepad process. Wait, that's a legitimate command, but maybe part of a larger pattern?\n\nLooking further, there's WMIC.exe loading several DLLs, including urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and some Defender DLLs. Hmm, amsi.dll is related to antivirus, but loading it via WMIC might be suspicious. Also, the paths for the Defender DLLs seem standard, but maybe the context matters. Then, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file could be normal, but maybe if it's unexpected?\n\nThere are also multiple registry events, like Registry value set by cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and others. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys, that's a red flag. However, the logs don't specify which keys, so it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the presence of 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll. That's odd because Calculator is a standard app, and urlmon is used for internet-related tasks. Maybe a legitimate process, but could be a sign of something else if it's not typical.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious parts are the WMIC loading of DLLs, especially amsi.dll and Defender DLLs, which might be related to evasion techniques. Also, the multiple registry changes and the winlogbeat file creation. However, without more context, like unusual command lines or unexpected parent processes, it's hard to confirm. But considering the combination of these events, there's enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: WMIC.exe loading potentially malicious DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), registry modifications by non-system processes, and unusual process creation (e.g., cmd.exe spawning notepad.exe). These patterns may indicate adversarial activity or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, I should look for any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first batch, there's a lot of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. Then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe involved. The cmd.exe line has a command to create a notepad.exe process using wmic. That seems a bit odd because using wmic to start processes can be a sign of something malicious, especially if it's obfuscating the command.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are related to Windows Defender, but loading them from unexpected paths might be a red flag. The paths mentioned are in ProgramData, which is a common place for malware to hide. Also, the image load events for these DLLs could indicate that something is trying to bypass security features.\n\nThere's also winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if it's part of a log collection process, but if the file is named .yml.new, maybe it's an attempt to modify configuration files. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn the second batch, there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard tool to check user context, so maybe part of a legitimate script. But combined with the previous events, like the WMIC and PowerShell accesses, it might be part of a larger sequence.\n\nI need to check if there are any signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or unusual process interactions. The presence of multiple registry value sets and process accesses could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or inject code. The use of WMIC and PowerShell is common in both legitimate and malicious scripts, so it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nAnother thing is the logon events. Services.exe and svchost.exe are normal system processes, but the special logon event might be related to a user logging in, which could be normal. However, if there's no user context provided, that might be a concern.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of suspicious process creation via WMIC, loading of security-related DLLs from unusual paths, and multiple registry modifications could indicate a potential security incident. However, without more context or indicators of compromise, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the presence of these elements, it's leaning towards being interesting and possibly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlighted**\n1. **WMIC and PowerShell Usage**:\n   - **`wmic process create notepad.exe`** (via `cmd.exe`) is a classic technique for obfuscating malicious payloads. While `notepad.exe` is benign, the method of invocation (via `wmic`) raises red flags, as it can be used to execute arbitrary commands stealthily.\n\n2. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - **`WMIC.exe` and `svchost.exe`** loading **`urlmon.dll`**, **`amsi.dll`**, and **`MpOAV.dll`** from **`C:\\Windows\\System32`** (expected) and **`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\...`** (unexpected) could indicate:\n     - **DLL hijacking** or **tampering** with legitimate system components.\n     - Attempts to **bypass security mechanisms** (e.g., `amsi.dll` is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface).\n\n3. **File Creation in User Directories**:\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating **`.winlogbeat.yml.new`** in the **`Downloads`** folder suggests potential **misconfiguration** or **malicious tampering** with log collection tools. This could be an attempt to inject malicious configurations or exfiltrate data.\n\n4. **Frequent Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events involving **`powershell.exe`**, **`svchost.exe`**, and **`notepad.exe`** may indicate **registry-based persistence** or **modification of system policies**.\n\n5. **`whoami.exe` Execution**:\n   - While `whoami.exe` is a standard utility for checking user context, its execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities (e.g., WMIC, DLL loading) may be part of a **privilege escalation** or **reconnaissance** phase.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal\/System Activity**\n- **`chrome.exe`** performing DNS queries and network connections: Expected for a browser.\n- **`services.exe`** and **`svchost.exe`** hosting system services: Normal system behavior.\n- **`calc.exe`** and **`Calculator.exe`** loading `urlmon.dll`: Likely benign, as these are standard Windows applications.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not definitively confirm a security incident**, but they **contain multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation:\n- **Check for unauthorized modifications** to system DLLs (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `urlmon.dll`).\n- **Investigate the `winlogbeat.yml.new` file** for tampering or malicious configurations.\n- **Correlate events** with user activity logs, network traffic, and process tree analysis to determine if the observed behavior aligns with legitimate workflows or indicates a **malicious actor**.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting** (likely requires deeper analysis to confirm benignity or malicious intent)."}
