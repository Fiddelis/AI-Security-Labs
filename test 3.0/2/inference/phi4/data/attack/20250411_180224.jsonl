The use of 'schtasks.exe' to create a task named 'win32times' and the attempt to run non-existing PowerShell scripts suggest an effort to conduct operations stealthily or evade detection. Additionally, repeated registry value modifications by processes like 'svchost.exe', which is commonly used for legitimate system functions but can also be exploited by malware, further raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
