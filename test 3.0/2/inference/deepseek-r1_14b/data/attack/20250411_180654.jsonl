{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe creating a file named \"objeto_temporario.txt\". PowerShell is often used maliciously because it can execute scripts. Creating files might be part of data collection or persistence.\n\nNext, several events show chrome.exe modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome sometimes makes registry changes during updates or configuration, repeated writes could be suspicious if they're not aligned with known behavior.\n\nThen, whoami.exe was run without arguments. Whoami is usually benign but can be used by attackers to check permissions or system info. The command line doesn't seem malicious here, though.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple powershell.exe processes accessing and modifying registry values. Powershell scripts often interact with the registry, but repeated access could indicate privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI notice that in some events, powershell.exe is executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic for keyloggers used in surveillance malware. The use of such scripts with command-line arguments pointing to different paths might be an attempt to avoid detection by varying the file location.\n\nThe last few events are powershell.exe processes again, each invoking Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from various locations. This repetition could indicate a script being called multiple times or from different directories, which is unusual and potentially malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of Powershell executing scripts that appear to be keystroke loggers, coupled with registry modifications and file creation, raise red flags. These activities are often linked to persistence, data exfiltration, or surveillance, which are hallmarks of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) aimed at capturing keystrokes, combined with registry modifications and file creation activities, indicate possible unauthorized access or surveillance. This behavior is indicative of potential malicious activity requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Powershell Execution**: Several entries show `powershell.exe` being executed with command lines pointing to scripts like `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`. This script name suggests it might be logging keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware for keylogging.\n   \n2. **Script Paths**: The paths mentioned (e.g., `modulo_padrao`, `elemento_base`) are generic and don't seem to be standard system directories. Malicious scripts often use such non-standard locations to avoid detection.\n\n3. **File Operations**: There are multiple file creation and deletion events related to PowerShell scripts in temporary directories. For instance, creating a script named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1` and then deleting it might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or clean up evidence.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: One event shows a registry value being set by `powershell.exe`, which could be part of establishing persistence or modifying system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\n5. **Multiple Similar Events**: The repetition of similar command lines and file operations indicates that this activity might be part of a larger, possibly automated processâ€”like a script running multiple times or across different directories.\n\n6. ** benign Activities**: There are some events related to legitimate processes like `winlogbeat.exe` creating configuration files. However, these don't outweigh the suspicious activities related to PowerShell and file operations.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious scripts, coupled with attempts to create and delete files in temporary locations. These behaviors are red flags for malware or unauthorized access. While there's a mix of legitimate activities, the overall pattern suggests malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious scripts and suspicious file operations indicative of keylogging activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
