{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from `chrome.exe` with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. These seem normal since Chrome is a common browser that connects to the internet and resolves DNS names frequently. Nothing unusual here on their own.\n\nNext, I notice multiple events involving `powershell.exe`. The first event shows PowerShell accessing a process, which could be legitimate but might also indicate malicious activity. Then there's the creation of a process using a command line with `ls -recurse` and other commands. This looks suspicious because it involves recursive directory listings, which attackers often use to gather information about the system.\n\nAnother event logs file creation and deletion in a temporary directory. The file is named `__PSScriptPolicyTest`, which seems like part of PowerShell's script policy testing. However, the fact that the file is created and immediately deleted might be an attempt to avoid detection, which raises red flags.\n\nThere are several events where PowerShell accesses registry values and loads various DLLs. While some of these actions are normal for PowerShell scripts, others like accessing sensitive registry keys or loading non-standard libraries could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks without associated files. These might be part of legitimate script execution but combined with other events could suggest something more nefarious.\n\nFinally, a pipe is created by PowerShell. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which in some cases can be exploited for command injection or lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the consistent use of PowerShell with potentially malicious commands and unusual file handling suggests possible malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to definitively conclude but certainly warrants closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe including process access, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temp directory, and unusual network connections. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or exploit attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are related to either file operations or registry changes. The first event shows powershell.exe loading a DLL from a Microsoft Defender path. That seems normal because Defender often uses PowerShell for scripts and system checks.\n\nThe next event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is an agent used for log management, so it's expected to create files here.\n\nThen there's a powershell command being executed with 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem', which are standard dir commands. No red flags here; these are common operations.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event creates a file named 'objeto_principal.txt'. This is unusual because it doesn't seem to be part of normal operations. The name suggests it's maybe a custom script or something malicious, but without context, I can't be sure.\n\nPowershell.exe creating files in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory isn't uncommon as it's used for initializing profiles.\n\nMultiple events show powershell.exe and svchost.exe setting registry values. While this could indicate configuration changes, many legitimate processes do this. However, repeated registry writes from multiple executables might warrant closer look.\n\nI notice several instances where svchost.exe is making registry changes. Svchost is a common system process but can also be used by malware to hide activities. Multiple entries here could mean something's amiss.\n\nThere are also events labeled as 'Special Logon' and 'User Account Management'. These relate to user logons and group policies, which aren't inherently suspicious unless they occur at unusual times or in large numbers.\n\nFinally, RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe making registry changes. RuntimeBroker is a legitimate Windows process, so that's normal. Notepad accessing the registry might be for configuration but isn't common—maybe it was used to edit some settings.\n\nPutting it all together: There are a few points of interest—like the creation of 'objeto_principal.txt' and multiple registry writes by svchost.exe. However, most events are standard system activities. Without more context or anomalies like time correlation or unusual paths, the batch doesn't strongly indicate malicious behavior but does have some flags that need monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe and svchost.exe performing registry writes, which could be indicative of potential malicious activity. Additionally, the creation of 'objeto_principal.txt' by powershell.exe is unusual and warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"Multiple events show system processes making changes to the registry and file system in ways that could indicate suspicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events, each representing some system activity. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the logs one by one to see what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first event: It's PowerShell.exe loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal because Defender uses PowerShell scripts for certain tasks. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting logs, so it's expected to create files there. Nothing wrong here.\n\nThe third event has PowerShell with a command line that seems like it's listing files recursively. The command is \"& {ls -recurse\\ngci -recurse}\", which translates to \"Get-ChildItem\" in different directories. This could be part of normal script execution, maybe an inventory or backup process. Not immediately alarming.\n\nThen there are several events where svchost.exe writes to the registry. SvcHost is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various services. Registry writes are common and not unusual unless they're modifying known malicious keys, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nI notice multiple entries from services.exe with tasks like 'Logon' and 'Special Logon'. These are related to user logon events, which could be part of a brute-force attempt or credential stuffing. However, without seeing repeated failed attempts or specific times around these logs, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThere are also several 'User Account Management' tasks. This is typically for account creation, deletion, or modification. If these were happening outside of normal business hours or in bulk, that could raise a red flag, but without context on timing or volume, I can't be certain.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event with calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems a bit odd because Calculator usually doesn't load such DLLs. URLMON is related to handling URLs and could indicate some kind of exploit or malicious activity. This might be worth looking into more.\n\nAnother log shows Calculator.exe also loading the same urlmon.dll, which reinforces the suspicion that something's off with these processes. It's unusual for benign apps like calc or calculator to interact with URL-related functions.\n\nPutting it all together: There are some normal activities like Defender scripts and log collection, but there are also signs that could indicate malicious behavior, such as multiple registry writes by svchost.exe and the use of urlmon.dll by calc.exe. These might be indicators of malware attempting to hide or perform unauthorized actions.\n\nI should consider the context—like whether these logs happened over a short period, during off-hours, or if there are other signs like network traffic anomalies. Without that info, it's safer to err on the side of caution and flag this batch as potentially suspicious. It might not be an active threat, but it's better to check than ignore.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains both normal and potentially suspicious activities. Here's a concise summary:\n\n1. **Normal Activities:**\n   - PowerShell.exe executing scripts related to Windows Defender.\n   - winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory.\n   - svchost.exe modifying the registry, which is standard for service hosting.\n\n2. **Potentially Suspicious Activities:**\n   - Multiple 'User Account Management' tasks without context on timing or volume.\n   - calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is unusual for these processes and may indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The logs show signs that could be indicative of malicious behavior, such as the use of system processes inappropriately. It's advisable to investigate further, especially focusing on the activities involving svchost.exe and the use of urlmon.dll by calc.exe."}
