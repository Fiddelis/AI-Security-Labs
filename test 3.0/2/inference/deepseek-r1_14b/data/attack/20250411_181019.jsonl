{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of system events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I see several instances where PowerShell and cmd.exe are being used. PowerShell is commonly associated with both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines here don't immediately show anything suspicious, but the repeated use of PowerShell might be worth looking into if there's an unusual number of accesses.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where Registry values are being set by various processes like cmd.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of installing software or malicious payloads. The fact that so many different processes are making changes to the registry could indicate something is wrong, especially if these changes aren't expected or don't align with known legitimate activities.\n\nThere's a command in one event: \"cmd.exe \/c sc create win32times binPath= \\\"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\" & sc qc win32times\". This seems suspicious because it's trying to create a service that executes a PowerShell script. The script path mentioned, \"\\NonExistingScript.ps1\", might be an attempt to execute code that isn't supposed to exist, which could be malicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where Registry values are being set by various services like svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. These processes are often part of legitimate Windows operations, but unusual activity here can indicate a compromise or malware attempting persistence.\n\nAnother point is the use of sc.exe to create and query services, which is another red flag because attackers often use such tools to maintain persistence on a system by creating malicious services that run at startup.\n\nI notice some repeated process creations and accesses, particularly with cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and others. This repetition could be part of an automated attack or script execution, which is more concerning than isolated events.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where legitimate processes like Calculator.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are involved in Image Load or Registry changes. While these can be normal, the context of when and how they're used might raise suspicions if they're part of a sequence that doesn't make sense for their usual operation.\n\nFinally, considering the overall pattern: multiple process creations with commands to set registry values, create services, and execute scripts points towards potential malicious activity like installing backdoors or persistence mechanisms. The combination of these events across different processes suggests a coordinated effort rather than random noise.\n\nGiven all these factors—repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for service creation, suspicious script execution attempts, multiple registry modifications by various processes—I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting. While some events on their own might not be alarming, the cumulative effect raises red flags that could indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe usage, registry modifications, service creation attempts, and script executions. These events collectively suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is being accessed or created. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's appearing several times could indicate potential suspicious activity, especially if these accesses happen in quick succession or in an unusual context.\n\nNext, I notice a lot of Registry value set events from various processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and even RuntimeBroker.exe. While some of these might be normal system operations, excessive registry modifications can sometimes be a red flag because attackers often use the registry to persistence their malware or alter system configurations without being easily detected.\n\nThere are also entries where specific files are being loaded or created. For example, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll and chrome.exe accessing amsi.dll. These could just be normal operations, but it's worth checking if these activities align with expected behavior for those processes. Malware often uses legitimate processes to hide malicious activity, so unusual file loads could indicate something more.\n\nAnother point is the repeated File created event from winlogbeat.exe. If this is a monitoring tool, it might not be suspicious on its own, but if there's an irregularity in how it's being used or unexpected files are created, that could warrant closer investigation.\n\nI also see some Image loaded events for system files like urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows components, so unless these loads are happening at unusual times or from unauthorized processes, they might not be concerning.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The high frequency of Registry modifications and repeated access to PowerShell.exe stand out as possible indicators of malicious behavior. Additionally, some entries like the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new file could be part of legitimate operations, but without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are enough red flags to suggest that this log might contain signs of a potential security incident or attempted breach. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to determine the nature and extent of these activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several indicators that may warrant closer examination:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell.exe Accesses**: The frequent use of PowerShell.exe could indicate malicious activity, as it's a tool often exploited by attackers for its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Excessive Registry Modifications**: Numerous events involve setting registry values across various processes. While some are normal, excessive modifications can be suspicious, especially if they suggest unauthorized persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **File Load Activities**: Processes like calc.exe and chrome.exe loading specific DLLs might not be inherently malicious, but unusual file loads could signal malware attempting to hide its presence.\n\n4. **File Creation Events**: The creation of files by monitoring tools like winlogbeat.exe should be evaluated for legitimacy, especially if unexpected or irregular in nature.\n\n5. **Image Load Events**: Loading of system files is typically benign, unless it occurs in an unusual context or from unauthorized processes.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these factors suggests potential security concerns. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature and intent behind these log entries, particularly focusing on PowerShell.exe activity and registry modifications for signs of compromise."}
