Multiple instances show actions like ProcessAccess, Registry changes, loading various DLLs, and creating\/removing temporary files. The command lines in some powershell events include Base64 encoded strings that decode to a script using XOR encryption to communicate with example.com. This behavior is red flagging because it looks like an attempt to hide data being sent over the network, possibly exfiltrating information.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent and ImageLoad tasks might indicate attempts to maintain persistence or drop malicious components. Also, the creation and deletion of a temp file named __PSScriptPolicyTest suggests PowerShell is trying to bypass certain script execution policies, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nConsidering all these together—encrypted communication, unusual powershell activities, potential data exfiltration—the batch definitely warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts with XOR encryption and network communications indicate possible command-and-control or data exfiltration activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when dealing with startup scripts that might run at login without user knowledge.\n\nNext, there are several entries where different processes like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. These events alone aren't necessarily bad, but in combination with others, they might raise flags.\n\nI notice that svchost.exe is involved a few times too. SvcHost is a legitimate process, but it's often exploited by malware because it runs with higher privileges. Seeing multiple registry writes from svchost could be concerning.\n\nThere are also events from Calculator.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files or loading DLLs. This seems odd because these are typically benign processes. The fact that they're accessing system DLLs like urlmon.dll might not be normal, especially if done repeatedly.\n\nLooking at the Chrome process entries, there's a lot of registry writes and image loads. While Chrome is a common application, unusual activity here could indicate tampering or extensions doing something malicious. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe are worth noting.\n\nAnother point is the multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing processes (ProcessAccess). This might be an indication of process injection or lateral movement within the system, which is a red flag for potential malware activities.\n\nI also see that some events involve creating pipes in Chrome. Pipe creation can be used by malicious actors for inter-process communication, potentially to hide command and control channels or exfiltration of data.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple registry writes, file creations, process accesses from legitimate but often abused processes like PowerShell and svchost.exe, along with unusual behavior from Chrome, Calculator, and winlogbeat. These activities don't align with typical user actions and could be signs of a breach or ongoing malicious activity. Therefore, it's important to investigate these events further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - **powershell.exe:** Known for scripting and can execute commands. Multiple entries suggest possible misuse.\n   - **svchost.exe:** Often used by malware due to high privileges; multiple registry writes are suspicious.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Frequent RegistryEvent tasks indicate potential persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malicious software.\n\n3. **File Creation and DLL Loading:**\n   - Processes like Calculator.exe loading system DLLs might be unusual and could signal tampering.\n   - winlogbeat.exe creating files might relate to log management, but the specific path needs verification.\n\n4. **Process Access and Injection:**\n   - powershell.exe accessing other processes (ProcessAccess) suggests possible injection or lateral movement, a sign of potential malware activity.\n\n5. **Chrome Behavior:**\n   - Multiple RegistryEvent tasks and pipe creation could indicate malicious extensions or command and control activities.\n\n6. **Combine All Indicators:**\n   - The cumulative effect of these events—registry writes, file creations, process accesses from high-risk processes, and unusual behavior in common apps like Chrome—points to potential malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch contains multiple indicators of potential malicious activity, including suspicious process behaviors, registry modifications, and unusual file operations. These activities merit further investigation to determine if a security incident has occurred or is ongoing."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessing various tasks. Specifically, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is used with command lines that delete files in specific paths. For example, one event shows \"Remove-Item\" targeting a .bat file and using \"-Force -ErrorAction Ignore,\" which makes me think this could be an attempt to remove logs or evidence without any errors showing up.\n\nThen, there are several registry access events from both PowerShell and Chrome.exe. The fact that multiple processes are modifying the registry might indicate some kind of persistence mechanism being set up, or perhaps it's related to malicious activity trying to stay undetected.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion in temporary directories. PowerShell creates a script in the Temp folder but then immediately deletes it. This behavior is suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection by security tools that look for known malicious file hashes.\n\nAlso, there are image loads from various DLLs within PowerShell's process. While this isn't inherently bad, the combination with other events makes me concerned about potential execution of malicious scripts or lateral movement within the system.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and the frequency, multiple events happening in quick succession could indicate a concerted effort to perform actions that might be part of an attack chain. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments stands out because it's commonly used in attacks for its scripting capabilities and execution of malicious code.\n\nI'm also noticing that some processes are being created without associated files, which might suggest they're part of a larger campaign or toolset deployment. The deletion of these temporary script files adds to the concern about evidence destruction.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activity: repeated use of PowerShell with deletion commands, registry modifications, and file operations in temp directories. These activities together could indicate an attack or attempt at persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe creating and deleting files, modifying the registry, and evidence of potential script execution suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, I notice that powershell.exe is being executed multiple times with command lines that remove specific files. For example, \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item \\\"C:\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\registro_ativo\\\\..\\\\elemento_principal\\\\registro_logico_script.bat\\\" -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This looks like a script trying to delete batch files from certain directories. The use of -Force and ignoring errors might be to ensure deletion without user interaction, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are several such events where powershell is removing different .bat files. These scripts seem to target various locations with names like \"registro_logico_script.bat\" or \"tarefa_padrao_script.bat\". The consistent use of Remove-Item suggests automated deletion, possibly part of a cleanup routine after some malicious action.\n\nThen there are events where processes like cmd.exe and sc.exe are used. For instance, one event shows cmd.exe running with \"\/c sc.exe stop objeto_temporario>nul 2>&1 & sc.exe delete estrutura_secundario>nul 2>&1\". This looks like it's stopping and deleting a service, which could be part of uninstalling something or removing traces of an application. Using sc.exe to manage services is common for legitimate administration but can also be used maliciously.\n\nI also see that whoami.exe is being run a couple of times. That command typically retrieves user information, so it might be used by scripts to determine the current user context, which could be part of privilege escalation or just process execution as another user.\n\nThere are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. For example, \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" suggests modifications to system configurations, which can be either legitimate admin tasks or attempts to persistence malicious activities in the system.\n\nLooking at all these together, it seems like a series of actions that could indicate a script trying to clean up after itself by deleting files and stopping services. However, the combination is concerning because:\n\n1. Multiple powershell.exe instances running scripts to delete specific files.\n2. Use of cmd.exe with sc.exe to stop and delete services.\n3. Registry modifications which can be used for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nWhile each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, the pattern suggests a potential attack chain where an adversary is attempting to remove traces of their activity or set up persistence mechanisms. The repeated use of powershell with deletion commands, coupled with service manipulation and registry changes, raises red flags about possible malicious intent.\n\nTherefore, the entire batch seems relevant for further investigation because these activities could be indicative of a cyberattack, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration cleanup, or establishing backdoors.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that the log events exhibit characteristics consistent with potential malicious activity. The combination of multiple powershell.exe executions deleting files, service manipulation via cmd.exe and sc.exe, and registry modifications suggests a possible attack chain aimed at removing traces or establishing persistence. These actions are concerning due to their alignment with common adversary tactics.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Multiple Powershell Executions:** Several entries show powershell.exe running scripts that delete specific .bat files. The use of -Force and error suppression indicates automated cleanup, possibly to remove evidence of prior malicious activities.\n\n2. **Cmd.exe and Sc.exe Usage:** Commands using sc.exe within cmd.exe suggest attempts to stop and delete services, which could be part of uninstalling a service or removing traces, often seen in attacks to cover tracks.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:** Events where registry values are set could indicate efforts to create persistence points for malware or escalate privileges, common in attacks to maintain access.\n\n4. **Whoami.exe Execution:** This command is used to determine user context, potentially aiding in privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\n5. **Pattern Analysis:** The sequence and combination of these activities suggest a coordinated effort rather than random events, increasing the suspicion of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits behaviors that align with potential cyberattack indicators, including file deletion, service manipulation, and registry tampering. These actions warrant further investigation to determine if they are part of an active threat or legitimate system administration activities."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a process creation for cmd.exe with the command line deleting a file in the temp directory. That seems suspicious because deleting files can be part of malicious activity, especially if it's trying to cover tracks.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed or creates processes. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in capabilities for system administration and can execute commands. The fact that it's being accessed several times could indicate something fishy.\n\nI also notice cmd.exe setting registry values twice. Registry modifications are often part of persistence mechanisms, where malware sets registry entries to run at startup or maintain persistence across reboots. This adds to the suspicion.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process which is typically used to check user permissions and identity. In some cases, attackers use this to gather information about the system they're on. The presence of whoami could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nLooking further, there are several powershell.exe processes accessing registry values again. This repeated activity might be an attempt to modify system settings or create persistence points.\n\nOne event shows a file being created by powershell.exe and then immediately deleted. That's a red flag because creating and deleting files quickly can be used to hide evidence or drop malicious payloads temporarily.\n\nThere are also some events related to winlogbeat.exe, which I think is an agent for log shipping. It creates a configuration file, which isn't inherently suspicious unless it's being misused. But given the context of other activities, it might be worth looking into whether this is part of normal operations or something else.\n\nMultiple entries show powershell.exe with command lines that just have \"& {}\" — that doesn't look right. Usually, powershell commands would have more meaningful content if they're legitimate scripts. Empty commands could indicate attempts to bypass certain logging mechanisms or test the environment.\n\nPutting all this together: cmd.exe deleting files, accessing and modifying the registry, using whoami for info, multiple powershell accesses with possible empty command lines, creating and deleting temporary files — these are all signs that might point towards malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell and cmd for system changes and file operations without clear justification could be part of an attack chain.\n\nI should also consider if there's any indication of normal behavior. For example, legitimate sysadmin tasks sometimes involve registry edits and using tools like whoami or powershell. But the volume and combination here seem high, especially with the attempts to delete files and create temporary scripts that are then removed. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for powershell might indicate some instability or misuse.\n\nSo overall, while not every event is malicious on its own, the cluster of activities suggests a potential security incident. There's enough concerning behavior that it would be prudent to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several concerning behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **cmd.exe Activity**: The deletion of files in the temp directory could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\n2. **Powershell.exe Usage**: Multiple accesses and processes with empty command lines suggest possible misuse, as legitimate scripts typically have meaningful commands.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: cmd.exe setting registry values twice may be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\n4. **whoami.exe Execution**: This could be part of reconnaissance to gather system information.\n\n5. **File Creation and Deletion**: Powershell.exe creating a temporary file and then deleting it quickly is suspicious, possibly indicating an attempt to hide evidence or drop malicious payloads temporarily.\n\n6. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity**: Creating a configuration file might not be inherently suspicious, but in the context of other activities, it's worth investigating.\n\n7. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: Repeated events for powershell could indicate instability or misuse, such as testing the environment or attempting to bypass logging.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities suggests a potential security incident. While some behaviors could be legitimate, the volume and nature of the logs merit further investigation to determine if they are part of an attack chain. It is advisable to conduct a detailed review of the events to assess the risk and take appropriate action."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the initial event has a process named 'powershell.exe' with an empty command line and the task as 'Engine Lifecycle'. That seems normal because PowerShell can have various lifecycle events.\n\nNext, there are several entries where PowerShell loads different DLLs. These ImageLoad tasks are typical when any application starts up; it's just part of initializing the environment. Nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nThen I see a FileCreate event in the user's AppData directory. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but sometimes it can be part of malicious activities. However, without more context, this could just be normal script execution.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple Registry value sets by both PowerShell and conhost.exe. Again, registry access is common, especially for configuration purposes. But if these accesses were to unusual keys or happened repeatedly, that might raise a flag.\n\nI notice several 'Process Create' events for cmd.exe with command lines that delete files in the TEMP directory. The command line shows they're trying to remove an executable named modulo_base.exe. Deleting temporary files is something legitimate processes do, but it's worth noting if this happens in a pattern or if the file being deleted is malicious.\n\nThere are also 'Process accessed' events for various processes. This could mean that other processes are interacting with them, which can be normal but might indicate some form of process injection or communication if seen in conjunction with other signs.\n\nTowards the end, there's another FileCreate event in the Downloads folder for a file named tarefa_comum.txt. That seems benign unless it's related to some malicious activity elsewhere.\n\nA few events stand out: one where PowerShell is used to remove a log file (key.log) from the TEMP directory and another process create event for that same command. This could be an attempt to cover tracks by deleting logs, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, multiple instances of similar commands being run might indicate scripting or automated behavior, which isn't necessarily malicious but could be part of a larger campaign.\n\nPutting it all together, there are elements that raise suspicion, like the deletion of log files and repeated Registry accesses. However, these actions aren't definitive proof of malicious activity on their own. They could also be from legitimate scripts or processes trying to clean up after themselves. Without additional context or more events showing unusual behavior, I'm not certain this batch is indicative of a security incident.\n\nSo, while there are some red flags, they're not strong enough without further investigation to classify the entire batch as definitely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes and activity, including legitimate use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for tasks like file creation\/deletion and registry access.

Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, most of these events involve powershell.exe. That's immediately flagging some interest because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware tends to use it for command and control or executing scripts.\n\nLooking at the details, a lot of the events are about image loading and file operations. For example, there's an event where a file is created in the TEMP directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1. Then, right after that, the same script is deleted. This seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script could be part of an attempt to avoid detection or clean up traces.\n\nThere's also a command line event where powershell.exe is used with Remove-Item to delete key.log in the TEMP directory. The fact that they're using ErrorAction Ignore suggests they don't want any errors to surface, which might indicate they're trying to hide something. This could be part of an attempt to remove logs or evidence.\n\nOther events include registry value sets and process accesses. These are common in malicious activities because attackers often need to modify the system's configuration or interact with other processes to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is launched with different command lines and parameters. The repetition might be part of an automated script trying to execute commands without being noticed, or it could indicate a tool like Powratus or Empire being used.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows several red flags:\n1. Multiple file operations in TEMP directory.\n2. Use of PowerShell with known malicious command patterns (deleting files, creating scripts).\n3. Registry modifications which can be signs of persistence or lateral movement.\n4. The repeated use of powershell.exe suggests an ongoing activity.\n\nGiven all these points, it seems like this batch is definitely worth investigating because the activities could indicate a potential security incident.

I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So, seeing it pop up multiple times might be a red flag. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few entries show powershell.exe loading images, like clrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. These seem like legitimate Windows files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1. That looks suspicious because it's a PowerShell script in a temporary folder, which could be part of malicious activity trying to hide scripts.\n\nThen, that same file gets deleted right after being created. Deleting files quickly can sometimes indicate an attempt to remove evidence, so that makes me think something might be off.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is called with \"& {}\" as the command line. I'm not entirely sure what that does, but it seems unusual. Maybe it's a way to execute commands without logging much, which would be a tactic for hiding malicious activities.\n\nThere are also multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks logged by powershell.exe. These might be normal operations, but when combined with other events, they could raise concerns about something more nefarious happening in the background.\n\nThen I see whoami.exe being executed a few times. Whoami is typically used to get system information, so it's not inherently bad, but if it's run by malicious code, it could be part of an attack chain to gather system details.\n\nThere are some registry access events and process accesses logged, which could indicate that something is trying to interact with other processes or modify system configurations. This might be a sign of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that the last few events involve winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting logs, so this seems normal unless it's being misused as part of an attack.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell.exe instances, creation and deletion of temporary scripts, unusual command lines, interaction with other processes, and system information gathering. All these factors combined make me think there's a high likelihood of malicious activity here.\n\nI'm not 100% certain because some events might be part of legitimate operations, but the pattern seems too consistent and concerning to ignore.

First, I notice that there are multiple entries from both powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The fact that it's being accessed several times might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking at the log types, most events are ProcessAccess and ProcessCreate tasks. These usually indicate when a process starts or accesses certain resources. However, without seeing any unusual file accesses or registry changes beyond one event, the activity seems routine. The single FileCreate event from winlogbeat.exe doesn't stand out as suspicious.\n\nThe repetition of whoami.exe could be part of user enumeration, but it's not enough to conclude malicious intent on its own. Similarly, the powershell.exe access without any script execution or privilege escalation signs isn't concerning.
