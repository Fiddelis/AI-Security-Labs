{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events are from chrome.exe with network connection detections and a DNS query. Chrome is a common application, and these activities like connecting to the internet or querying DNS are normal, so nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nThen I notice several entries from powershell.exe. The command line in some of these events stands out: it includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe, and others. These commands can be used for various system administration tasks but also have potential malicious uses. For example, 'net user' could enumerate users, 'get-localgroupmember -group Users' might list group members, and 'cmdkey.exe \/list' is often used to retrieve stored credentials. This combination raises a red flag because it's accessing sensitive information that an attacker might use.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is creating and then deleting a file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1. The creation of temporary PowerShell scripts can be part of malicious activities to execute arbitrary code or to evade detection by security tools. The fact that the script is deleted shortly after might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nMoreover, there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' events from powershell.exe with repetitive command lines. This repetition could suggest automated activity, possibly a script running multiple times or part of a larger campaign. Automated scripts in PowerShell can be used for various malicious purposes, including lateral movement within a network or data exfiltration.\n\nThe batch also includes registry modifications and image loading activities from powershell.exe. While these actions are common in legitimate scripting, they can also be indicators of malicious behavior, especially when combined with other suspicious actions like file creation and deletion.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of PowerShell to perform potentially harmful commands, coupled with the creation and deletion of a script file, suggests possible unauthorized access or malicious activity. The confidence level is high because multiple events point towards a coordinated effort that could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell process events with potentially malicious command lines and file operations, including enumeration commands and temporary script creation\/deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is being executed with command lines that include commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, and `cmdkey.exe \/list`. These are red flags because PowerShell is often used in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The presence of `net user` and `get-localgroupmember` suggests potential attempts to enumerate users and groups, which could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThere's also a command line that includes `ls C:\\Users`, which might indicate an attempt to list files in the Users directory, possibly looking for sensitive information or executing files. Additionally, `cmdkey.exe \/list` is used to retrieve stored credentials, which could be stolen for unauthorized access.\n\nAnother point of concern is the repeated use of `chrome.exe` making registry changes. While Chrome can make legitimate registry modifications, multiple such events might indicate suspicious activity, especially if they're not part of a known update or configuration process.\n\nLooking at other processes like `updater.exe`, `SDXHelper.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe`, their command lines seem to be related to legitimate operations (like system updates or credential management), but the combination with PowerShell activities raises suspicion. It's possible that these are part of a larger attack chain, such as dropping malware components or establishing persistence.\n\nThe events involving file creation by `powershell.exe` for `pacote_ativo.txt` could indicate an attempt to create or modify files on the system, potentially for exfiltration or storing malicious scripts. The path in the Downloads folder might suggest that the user is being socially engineered into executing something they downloaded.\n\nIn summary, the batch contains several indicators of potential malicious activity: PowerShell commands with known attack vectors, file creation by a high-risk process, and multiple registry modifications that could be part of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement. These activities together create a concerning pattern that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_malicious\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of suspicious activities including use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious commands, file creation by powershell, and repeated registry modifications which could indicate malware persistence or lateral movement.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I see a lot of repetitive entries with the same \"Security Group Management\" task in the winlog field. These are likely part of normal group policy updates and aren't unusual on their own.\n\nThen, looking at other entries, there's a mix of process creations like net.exe, powershell.exe, and others. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. \n\nI notice some file operations by powershell.exe creating files in the user's profile directory. While not always suspicious, creating files in non-standard locations might warrant closer inspection.\n\nRegistry changes made by powershell.exe could be part of script execution or configuration changes, which again raises an eyebrow but isn't definitive on its own.\n\nThe presence of multiple instances where different processes load system DLLs like urlmon.dll doesn't seem out of the ordinary. These are common Windows components.\n\nThere's also activity from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which are legitimate processes for updates and log management, respectively. Their actions here don't indicate anything malicious.\n\nGiven that there's no clear evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known indicators of compromise across the batch, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING.\" However, the use of powershell.exe with certain parameters and file creations could be red flags in other contexts. But without more malicious indicators, it's hard to justify an \"INTERESTING\" classification.\n\nI'm feeling about 70-80% confident that there's no malicious activity here, but I'd still keep an eye on any further actions from powershell.exe.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities and legitimate processes such as group management tasks, process creations, file operations, and registry changes. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or anomalies across the entire batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
