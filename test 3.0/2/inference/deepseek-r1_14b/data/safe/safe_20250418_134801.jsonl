{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are two events involving MicrosoftEdge.exe creating and changing file times for setup.exe. That seems normal since Edge updates might be installing or updating components. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loading AMSI.DLL is standard because AMSI is part of Windows Defender. No red flags here. Then it loads MpOAV.dll, which is again related to antivirus, so that's expected.\n\nThe setup.exe creating a pipe doesn't immediately raise alarms. Pipes are common for inter-process communication.\n\nLooking at the services.exe and special logon events—services.exe is a known system process, and logon events could be part of normal user activity or service startups. Not unusual.\n\nThere are several User Account Management tasks without specific details, which are typical during login processes or group policy updates.\n\nThen, taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll makes sense as Task Scheduler uses this DLL. svchost.exe modifying registry values is standard for services and their configurations.\n\nThe PowerShell command caught my attention. The command line shows it's using the restricted execution policy to check some INF files for specific patterns. While it's not overtly malicious, using PowerShell with such checks can be a precursor to more nefarious activities. It might be part of legitimate system administration or could indicate Reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n\nLooking further, another svchost.exe creating a process as LocalService and specifying BthAvctpSvc is normal for Bluetooth services in Windows. No issue there.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems okay; URLMON is used for handling URLs in various apps.\n\nThere's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file, which is expected if it's part of log management software running on the system.\n\nPutting all this together, most events are normal Windows and application activities. The PowerShell command stands out because it could be either benign admin work or early signs of malicious activity. However, without more context indicating something went wrong, like failed processes or access denials, I'm leaning towards it being part of normal operations or system checks.\n\nSo, overall, while there's a slightly elevated point with the PowerShell script, it doesn't rise to the level of clear malicious behavior when considering the entire batch. Thus, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are largely normal system activities, including updates and process creations, without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I see that all the events are in JSONL format, each line being a separate JSON object. Each event has a process name, a winlog task, and sometimes a file path. My goal is to analyze them as a whole batch and decide if they're worth investigating for potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n1. chrome.exe setting a registry value.\n2. MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll. That sounds familiar—MsMpEng is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal.\n3. winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting Windows logs, which I think is legitimate.\n4. CompatTelRunner.exe also loading taskschd.dll. Not sure about this one; maybe it's related to compatibility?\n5. svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization path. Svchost is a common system process, so that seems okay.\n\nContinuing through the events, I notice several entries from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and MpCmdRun.exe loading various Defender-related files. Edge updates are expected behavior, and MpCmdRun is part of Windows Defender's operations, so these aren't red flags.\n\nThere's an event where MicrosoftEdgeUpdate deletes a file in the Temp directory. That makes sense during an update process to clean up old files.\n\nI also see conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is used by command-line tools like cmd, and mintty is from Cygwin or similar environments. They're legitimate processes, so no issues here.\n\nGit.exe creating multiple files in a node_modules directory seems like normal development activity. Node.js modules are often handled this way, especially during installations or updates.\n\nLooking for anything unusual:\n- All the process names seem to be standard Windows utilities or legitimate software.\n- File operations are mostly create and load, which aren't inherently suspicious unless they're accessing unexpected locations.\n- The only delete action is from Edge Update, which is expected.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious processes or unexpected file accesses. Everything appears to be related to normal system operations, updates, and development activities. There's no indication of unauthorized access or malicious code execution.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch doesn't seem concerning. It's probably just routine system activity.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events does not indicate any suspicious or malicious activity. The processes observed are normal for a system undergoing updates and development activities. Therefore, this batch is **not interesting** from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interest_level\": \"low\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Events consist of standard system processes, legitimate software operations, and development activities with no signs of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

Since semver is a popular package for semantic versioning, it's likely part of a project setup or build process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The files are standard parts of a Node.js module, and the repeated file creation could be from npm installing packages or a git clone\/update operation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's look at the data provided.\n\nEach event is a JSON object representing a Windows log entry. The key fields are process name and file paths. All the events have the same process name: \"git.exe\". The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means Git is creating files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\semver\\\", followed by various filenames and subdirectories like internal, ranges, etc. This seems to be part of a Node.js module called semver because it's located in node_modules\/semver.\n\nSemver is a package used for semantic versioning, which is a standard for software versions. It's commonly included as a dependency in JavaScript projects. The files being created are typical parts of a module, like index.js, package.json, and various .js files under the ranges directory.\n\nSo, Git creating these files is likely part of installing or updating dependencies during a build process, which is normal when setting up a project with npm or yarn. There's nothing unusual here; it doesn't indicate any malicious activity. All events are consistent with standard package installation steps.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, suspicious file creation times, or unexpected locations. The user's context seems to be \"fiddelis\", which might be a legitimate account name.\n\nTherefore, this batch isn't indicative of any security issues and is part of normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files by Git during a Node.js module installation or update process, which is a normal activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, looking at each event, they all come from the same process: git.exe. The task is \"File created\" according to the winlog, and the files being created are inside a node_modules directory for different packages like semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, etc.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you clone a Git repository, especially one with Node.js projects, it's common for the process to download and install dependencies. This means creating directories and files under node_modules. So these events might just be part of the normal setup when someone is working on a project that uses Node.js.\n\nBut wait, could this indicate something malicious? I'm thinking about how attackers sometimes use Git to drop malware or create hidden files. However, in this case, all the file paths look legitimate for typical npm packages. There's nothing like executable files being created outside of the expected structure or unusual file names that might hint at malicious activity.\n\nAlso, each event is just a file creation by git.exe, which is standard during the checkout process when dependencies are fetched. So it doesn't seem suspicious in this context. Unless there's something I'm missing about the specific files or paths, but from what I can see, they're all part of common Node.js modules.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of these events. If someone was installing multiple packages quickly, could that be a sign? But again, for a project with many dependencies, this is normal. There's no indication here of failed attempts or unusual timing between file creations.\n\nSo putting it all together, these logs likely just show a user cloning or updating a repository that has several Node.js dependencies. Without any red flags like unexpected files or behaviors, I don't see a reason to flag this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities during the setup of Node.js modules, which is typical for development environments.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object indicating that the git.exe process has created various files in a Node.js module directory. All these activities are pretty standard when you're setting up or updating a project with Node.js dependencies.\n\nI notice multiple entries where the same process creates several files within different node_modules folders, which suggests this is part of the package installation process. The creation of index files, package.json, and readme.md aligns with typical npm operations. No signs of unusual file names or locations that could hint at malicious activity.\n\nThe paths are all within a user's Downloads directory under a course-related folder, making it likely that someone is working on a software project.

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line has some information about a file creation event on Windows, and the process involved is always \"git.exe\". \n\nFirst off, I notice that every single one of these events is from Git creating files in a specific directory. The paths all lead to things like node_modules and package.json, which makes me think this is related to a Node.js project setup. For instance, there's a folder named \"node_modules\" with various packages like \"side-channel\" and \"signal-exit\". These are common npm packages, so it seems like someone is installing dependencies using npm.\n\nThe fact that all these events are happening under the same process name (git.exe) suggests that this activity is part of the normal Git workflow. When you run commands like `npm install`, Git might create or update files in node_modules as part of managing dependencies. The creation of multiple files, including package.json and README.md, also aligns with setting up a project structure.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. There's no indication of file deletions, access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, or attempts to execute scripts without proper context.

That stands out because Git is commonly used for version control and software development. It's not inherently malicious, but I need to consider the context of its usage here.\n\nThe task in each Windows log entry is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, these are file creation events.
