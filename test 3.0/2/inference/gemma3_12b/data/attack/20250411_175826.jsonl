Specifically, numerous PowerShell processes are observed, including command lines manipulating file timestamps (attempting to hide modification dates), loading .NET framework components, creating and immediately deleting a temporary PowerShell script, and creating named pipes. The pattern of changing timestamps across multiple files, along with the use of PowerShell to achieve this, is a strong indicator of potential data manipulation or obfuscation. The presence of RuntimeBroker and Notepad registry events alongside PowerShell further complicates the picture and warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
