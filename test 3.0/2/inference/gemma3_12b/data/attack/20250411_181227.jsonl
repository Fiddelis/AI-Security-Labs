There's evidence of PowerShell usage, including the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, image loading of Windows Defender components (potentially for evasion), and the creation of scheduled tasks designed to execute 'calc.exe' at logon with elevated privileges (using the 'BUILTIN\\\\Administrators' group).  A significant number of 'Execute a Remote Command' events also appear, which warrants further investigation as this is often indicative of lateral movement or compromise.
