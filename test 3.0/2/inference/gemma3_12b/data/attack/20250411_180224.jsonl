The scripts reference non-existent file paths, which is suspicious. Also, the creation of scheduled tasks as `SYSTEM` user and creation of files within the tasks directory are concerning indicators of potential malicious activity. While there's also normal user activity (Chrome, winlogbeat), the scheduled task creation and PowerShell bypass usage are significant enough to warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
