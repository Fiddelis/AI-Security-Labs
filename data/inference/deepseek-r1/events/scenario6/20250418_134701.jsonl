There are multiple lines here, each representing an event with certain keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the processes, they all have \"git.exe\" as the name. That seems consistent across every event. So, it's a batch of git-related activities.\n\nNow, checking the winlog entries, each has \"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that in each case, a file was created according to a specific rule set by the system log. All these files are within the same path: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\...\". The pattern suggests that each file is part of a specific module related to lodash and Cypress, which I assume are libraries used in Node.js applications for various purposes.\n\nThe files listed all have extensions like .d.ts, which stands for CommonJS format. These appear to be TypeScript files, likely part of some project structure. Since all the processes are \"git.exe\", it's possible that these files were created while working on a Git repository, perhaps as part of building or deploying an application.\n\nPutting this together, each event is showing that while working with Git, a file in a specific structured path was created using certain rules. The consistency across all events suggests a systematic process—maybe automating some tasks during development or deployment workflows.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is relevant for investigation: the main question is whether these activities indicate malicious behavior. All the processes are related to Git, which is used for version control and doesn't inherently pose a security risk unless misused. The fact that they're all in a structured path with specific file names and extensions indicates they might be part of a legitimate project workflow.\n\nThere's no evidence here pointing towards malicious activity like unauthorized access, data breaches, or malware. All activities seem to follow standard Git operations for creating files within the project directory. There's nothing out of the ordinary about these events; hence, I don't see any reason to classify this batch as \"interesting\" in terms of indicating malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains consistent and systematic Git-related activities with files created following a specific naming pattern, suggesting a legitimate workflow without signs of malicious intent.\"\n}\n```"}

The process field is always \"git.exe\", which suggests that all these logs are related to Git activities. The winlog task is consistently \"File created\" according to the rule \"FileCreate\". Each file path points to different modules within a node_modules folder under S206 - Qualidade de Software, specifically in the cypress types and lodash fp category.\n\nSo, what do I have here? It seems like these are all Git commit events where files were added. The process is always git.exe creating a file using certain rules related to FileCreate. All the files are within specific subdirectories of node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp, which might indicate they're part of a project that uses Cypress for testing and Lodash fp utilities.\n\nConsidering the user's role as a cybersecurity expert, I need to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation. The logs show normal Git activity with files being created in standard locations related to a software project. There are no anomalies like unusual process names or unexpected winlog tasks.

The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification. I need to determine if the batch is relevant for investigation based on these logs.\n\nNow, looking at the processes: all of them are using git.exe. Git is usually related to version control systems. The winlog task is FileCreate, which suggests that during each event, a new file was created in the specified path. The files listed under \"file\" point to various lodash functions like intersection, invert, invoke, etc.\n\nI should think about whether this kind of activity is indicative of malicious behavior or if it's normal for someone using git and lodash. Creating multiple files with different lodash functions doesn't immediately raise a red flag unless there are other anomalies, such as unusual file creation patterns, permissions changes, or unexpected commands being run alongside the files.\n\nIn this case, all the activities seem routine. The process is consistent (git.exe), each event involves creating a new file following a specific pattern related to lodash functions.

That's interesting because git operations can be related to development activities or potential malicious code execution. But looking further, each event also has a \"winlog\" with a task of \"File created\", which follows a specific rule called \"FileCreate\".

All of them have the same process: \"git.exe\". That suggests they're all related to Git activities. Then there's a winlog task indicating \"File created\" which is consistent across the events. The file paths are also similar; they're pointing to various files in a node_modules directory under a user's Downloads folder.\n\nI'm thinking about what each part represents. The process name being \"git.exe\" suggests ongoing Git operations, possibly for a project. The winlog task of \"File created\" along with the specific file paths makes me think these are logs from a tool like Splunk or a similar system monitoring tool capturing activity in a software development environment.\n\nNow, considering the user's context: they're asking if this batch is relevant for investigation. My role is to determine if there's malicious behavior here. The fact that all events involve \"git.exe\" and file creation logs doesn't immediately point towards anything malicious unless these files are part of some attack or unauthorized activities.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem like typical outputs from a node_modules folder where various utility libraries for a project might be stored.

The winlog tasks all mention \"File created,\" indicating that files are being created during these events.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, they're all under a \"node_modules\" directory, specifically in the \"cypress\" package and its subdirectories like \"types\", \"lodash\", and others. This seems to be related to Cypress.js, which is used for browser automation. The fact that each event has \"File created\" suggests that these are activity logs from Cypress running on a browser.\n\nI should consider whether this batch of logs indicates malicious behavior or just normal usage. Since all events show file creation in the context of a known software tool (Cypress), it doesn't immediately raise red flags. There's no mention of unusual activities like unauthorized files being created, or attempts to gain access, so it seems benign.\n\nHowever, I should also think about how often these types of logs occur. If this is from an application under regular usage, then it might not be interesting unless there are other anomalies.

The process name in each case is \"git.exe,\" which suggests these are related to Git operations. Then there's a winlog entry indicating a task called \"File created\" with a rule applied. Finally, each has a file path that seems consistent across all lines.\n\nSo breaking it down: every event here shows that a process named \"git.exe\" created some files as per the rules defined in winlog. The file paths are all under the same directory structure related to software quality assurance and node_modules for Cypress. They seem to be files ending with .d.ts, which looks like TypeScript files.\n\nHmm, so this is a batch of events from Git executions where each execution created several files following specific naming conventions. The winlog captures these file creation tasks. Now, considering cybersecurity aspects, Git can sometimes be used maliciously, like in supply chain attacks or for embedding malware. However, based solely on the information given—process name, winlog task, and file paths—it doesn't immediately flag anything as suspicious.\n\nThe process is consistent across all events; there's no variation that would indicate different behaviors.

Creating files during the build process is a standard part of software development workflows, especially when using tools like Cypress for testing and npm for package management. The fact that all events follow the same pattern suggests consistent, normal behavior rather than any anomalous activity that would warrant an investigation.\n\nAdditionally, without any specific flags or indicators pointing towards malicious intent (like unauthorized access, file encryption, or unusual permissions), there's no red flag here.

That tells me these are all Git activity logs—specifically, file creation events. Each entry includes a winlog with the task set to \"File created\" using the FileCreate rule, which makes sense since they're all about creating files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to be related to a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This suggests that these logs are from a software development context, specifically quality assurance or testing. The directories like cypress, node_modules, and packages like Cypress, types, lodash, fp indicate that this might be configuration files for Cypress tests, which is a popular testing tool in web development.\n\nNow, considering the combination of all events: they're all Git file creation logs related to a specific project using Cypress for testing. While Git activity on its own doesn't raise immediate red flags, when combined with the context of Cypress test configurations and software quality assurance activities, it might indicate ongoing or potential testing activities in development environments.\n\nI need to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation. The presence of multiple Git create events over time could suggest active development or testing. However, without more contextual information like timestamps indicating a recent activity within a specific timeframe (e.g., during a bug fix session), it's hard to pinpoint an anomaly. \n\nBut given that all logs are from the same process and related to file creation in a software project with quality assurance implications, they might warrant further investigation into how these files are managed or if there's any suspicious activity, such as unauthorized modifications or changes.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I believe this batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows ongoing development activities related to software testing and configuration, which could potentially be a point of concern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\", \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple Git file creation events related to a project using Cypress for testing.

The \"process\" key has a value of \"git.exe\" every time, which means all these logs are from Git processes. The \"winlog\" indicates that each event's task was \"File created\" according to the rule \"FileCreate\". That's consistent across all entries.\n\nLooking at the \"file\" key, each entry has a specific file path pointing to various files within a node_modules folder related to Cypress and Lodash.

The winlog task is consistently \"File created\" across all events, indicating that a file was newly created during the Git operation. The file paths point to various files related to software development, specifically in node_modules, which suggests that these are package or dependency-related files.\n\nI notice that each event corresponds to a different file being processed by Git: unzip.d.ts, unzipWith.d.ts, update.d.ts, and so on.

While creating files during development isn't inherently malicious, repeated creation or unusual patterns could be concerning if there are unauthorized changes or backdoor activities.\n\nHowever, looking at all the events together, they're all straightforward file creations under known project directories using standard Lodash structures. There's no indication of anything out of the ordinary like unexpected processes, unusual file accesses, or signs of malicious intent beyond normal software development activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these logs show regular file creation tasks associated with a legitimate project using standard practices. There's no red flag pointing towards malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch doesn't require further investigation as it appears to be part of normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show consistent and expected file creation activities related to a known software project using standard Lodash modules in a node_modules directory.

{"file":"events\/scenario6\/20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, I'm supposed to analyze a batch of events in JSONL format and determine if it's relevant for investigation based on whether it's \"Interesting\" or \"Not Interesting\". The classification is based solely on the entire batch, not individual events.\n\nLooking at the data provided, each line represents an event with three main components: process, winlog task, and file path. All processes are \"git.exe\", which suggests these logs are related to Git activities. The winlog tasks consistently mention \"File created\" across all entries, indicating that each log entry pertains to a new file being created.\n\nThe files listed under the \"file\" key show various paths, including different modules from the 'lodash' package and different cypress types like 'initial.d.ts', 'intersection.d.ts', etc. This seems to indicate an examination of how Git interacts with these specific files over time.\n\nNow, considering the context, cybersecurity experts often monitor logs for malicious activities such as unauthorized access, malware execution, or suspicious command-line interface (CLI) usages that might hide malicious commands. However, in this batch, all events are related to creating files using Git and its associated processes. There's no indication of any malicious behavior here.\n\nFurthermore, the consistent process name and winlog task don't point towards any anomalies. The focus is purely on file creation activities under the specified paths, which are part of a normal development or testing environment setup, not something that would require immediate investigation.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that the batch isn't interesting because it doesn't contain any signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\", \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The JSONL events consistently show a process ('git.exe') creating files under specific paths related to the 'lodash' and 'cypress' packages.

{"file":"events\/scenario6\/20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this problem where I have a bunch of JSONL events, each representing some system logs. The task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's relevant for investigation based on whether it shows malicious behavior.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each event contains. Each line seems to be an object with three properties: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which makes sense since they're all capturing git actions. The winlog task is consistently set to \"File created\" under the rule FileCreate, so that's a pattern I can note.\n\nLooking at the files, each one has a specific path pointing to different lodash functions. For example, there are entries like isrInteger.d.ts and isrMatchWith.d.ts. These are TypeScript files related to lodash utilities, which is a library often used for JavaScript development. \n\nWait, why are these particular files relevant? Lodash isn't typically malicious, but the presence of many such files could indicate an automated build process or testing environment. Since they're all created by git and point to standard utility functions, it doesn't raise any red flags immediately.\n\nI should consider whether this batch is part of a larger system being monitored. If these are normal operations indicating code coverage or testing for a project, then there's no malicious intent here. However, if the user has a history of detecting anomalies in similar patterns, I might need to dig deeper.\n\nAnother point is that all the processes and winlog tasks are identical across the batch. There's no variation that could indicate different user sessions or varied activities, which could be signs of suspicious behavior. The consistent file paths also suggest they're part of a controlled environment rather than something out of place.\n\nSo, putting it all together: normal git operations capturing standard library utility functions in a testing or build environment. No malicious indicators present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains logs from the 'git.exe' process indicating file creation activities for various lodash utility files, which are commonly used during development and testing.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"events\/scenario6\/20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is relevant for investigation. I'm looking at a bunch of JSON objects here, each with the same structure: they all have a process name \"git.exe\", winlog task \"File created\" under rule FileCreate, and various file paths pointing to different files in a node_modules directory related to Cypress and Lodash.\n\nSo, first off, the process is always git.exe. That suggests we're looking at activity around the Git service or perhaps someone committing changes using Git. The winlog task consistently says \"File created\", which under the FileCreate rule indicates that these logs are capturing when files are added to the file system during a file creation operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be within Lodash's types directory in node_modules\/cypress\/types. Each file has a specific name ending like isSymbol.d.ts or join.d.ts, which I recognize as parts of Lodash's utility library. This makes me think these are static analysis rules being applied by Cypress, an end-to-end testing tool for web apps.\n\nSince all the events show consistent behavior—same process, same log task, and files from the same module—it suggests there's a pattern here. The fact that these files are part of Lodash means they're likely used in the static analysis process to inspect code during tests.\n\nNow, considering the classification criteria: is this batch relevant for investigation? Well, if we're looking for malicious activity or anomalous behavior, I don't see anything unusual here. All activities are within expected patterns related to using Cypress with Lodash utilities. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, malware, or any indicators of compromise.\n\nSo putting it all together: consistent process and log types indicate normal file creation tasks being analyzed by a static analysis tool like Cypress. The files belong to the Lodash library, which is standard for such tools. There's no anomaly that would necessitate further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows consistent activity related to Git file creation being analyzed by Cypress using standard Lodash utility files, with no signs of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

The goal is to determine if the batch is relevant for investigation based on certain criteria. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's given. Each line is a JSON object containing \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. There are 17 such events here, all with the same process name \"git.exe\". The winlog task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which suggests that each event indicates a file creation activity related to the Git process.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they all seem to be part of a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\" under the node_modules and cypress directories. The paths are consistent in structure, pointing to a directory where Lodash-related TypeScript files are located. This indicates that these might be auxiliary files for testing or quality assurance purposes.\n\nNow, considering the criteria for classification: if an event is relevant for investigation, it's likely related to malicious behavior such as unauthorized access, malicious code execution, data exfiltration, etc. However, in this case, all events are about normal Git file creation within a software project using Lodash and Cypress, which is common in development workflows.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious intent here. All activities appear legitimate. The fact that multiple files are being created systematically suggests ongoing software development or testing rather than an anomaly that would require immediate attention. There's no unusual behavior like unexpected process creation beyond Git, nor are there red flags indicating data breaches or unauthorized actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the consistent pattern of normal file creation related to a software build process, I conclude that this batch is not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\", \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events indicate normal Git file creation within a Lodash project, with no signs of malicious activity.\"}"}

The first thing I notice is that all the processes are \"git.exe\". That means these logs are related to Git activity.\n\nThen, each event has a \"winlog\" with a task of \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that there's a log entry every time a file is created during a Git operation. The files listed under \"file\" are all from the same location, specifically in a directory named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". That seems consistent and not malicious.\n\nLooking deeper, each file path has similar segments: node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash followed by specific function names like nthArg.d.ts or overSome.d.ts. These functions are part of the Lodash library's utility collection. There's no indication of any malicious behavior here; these look like normal Git operations with logging enabled for file creation events.\n\nThere's a total of 35 events, and all follow the same pattern without any anomalies. The consistent process name, log task, and file paths suggest this is just regular activity related to software development using Git and Lodash utilities.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, there's no reason to consider these logs as suspicious or malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events show consistent and normal behavior with Git-related processes.

The \"process\" field shows that all events are related to \"git.exe\". That's a specific application process. The \"winlog\" task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which suggests these logs come from a system monitoring tool like Windows Event Viewer, specifically when a file creation event occurs.\n\nThe \"file\" path for each event points to various files related to Lodash, such as pull.d.ts, pullAll.d.ts, etc. These are TypeScript files that are part of the Lodash library's node_modules. This indicates that these files were created during some operation, likely when someone was installing or updating a dependency.\n\nNow, considering if this batch is relevant for investigation: The process is specific to Git, which is a development tool, and the logs relate to file creation events. While it's possible that there could be malicious activity in managing dependencies (like tampering with package.json or lock files), this alone doesn't provide strong evidence of malicious intent without more context.\n\nHowever, looking at all the events together, they don't show any signs of being part of an unauthorized or suspicious activity. All actions are standard file creation within a typical development environment setup for Lodash dependencies. There's no indication of misuse or anything out of the ordinary here. The consistency in \"process\" and \"winlog\" tasks also suggests these are normal operations.\n\nTherefore, classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" makes sense because there's no outlier behavior that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\", \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show consistent file creation related to Lodash packages managed via Git.

The events are all from the same process: \"git.exe\".

The files are under \"node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\" and have variations like \"sample.d.ts\", \"setWith.d.ts\", etc. It seems like all these files were created in a similar timeframe since they're part of Lodash's types.\n\nI'm wondering if this indicates some sort of compromise or unauthorized access. The fact that multiple files are being created could suggest automated tools or script execution, but without more context about what these files do, it's hard to say definitively. However, the consistent naming and creation task don't raise any red flags immediately.\n\nThe process name is \"git.exe\", which typically relates to version control systems like Git. It's possible this was used for scanning malicious activity related to Git repositories or specific modules. But without knowing if there's a history of malicious activities from this particular Git execution, it's hard to link these files directly to anything suspicious.\n\nI'm also considering whether Lodash has known vulnerabilities. If these files were created recently and contain malicious code, that could be concerning. However, given the dates in the paths (they seem to be created around a specific time frame), I don't see any immediate indicators of compromise like exploit signatures or backdoors.\n\nIn summary, while there are multiple events with consistent patterns, they all point towards normal file creation within Lodash modules.

The logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object.

Each event has three main parts: process name, winlog task, and file path. All processes listed here are \"git.exe\", which suggests that these logs are related to someone using Git. The winlog tasks all fall under \"File created\" for various rules like FileCreate. The files in question are all located within a specific directory path that includes subfolders like 'node_modules', 'cypress', and 'types' with some filename variations, likely indicating different functions or components from the lodash library.\n\nNow, considering what I know about system logs, they usually include details on user activities, processes running, memory usage, disk operations, etc. In this case, all events are related to Git activity—opening files, creating new files, and working with specific modules. The consistent process name makes me think this is the same user or process interacting with multiple Git repositories.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to be part of a project structure where lodash functions (like startCase.d.ts) might be involved in processing data within the node_modules. However, without more context about how these files are being used, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's happening. But all this activity suggests that someone is actively working with Git and using specific helper libraries.\n\nThe classification criteria for investigation typically involves determining if there's any malicious intent or unusual behavior. While the consistent use of \"git.exe\" might indicate a user who's experienced, it doesn't inherently suggest malicious behavior unless combined with other indicators like unauthorized access, file theft, etc. The winlog task being \"File created\" is standard and could be part of regular development activities.\n\nThe files involved don't seem to indicate any unusual patterns.

There's a pattern here—each path ends with different .d.ts files related to Lodash functions like uniq.d.ts, unzipWith.d.ts, update.d.ts, and so on.\n\nSo, putting this together: the batch shows that during the execution of Git.exe, multiple files from the Lodash library are being created. These files have a consistent structure in their paths and are all related to various Lodash utility functions such as uniq, unzip, update, etc.\n\nNow, considering whether this is relevant for investigation... The primary concern would be identifying malicious activity or unauthorized actions.
