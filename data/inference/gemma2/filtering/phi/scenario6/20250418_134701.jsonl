This pattern is not typical of everyday system operations.\n* **Git Involvement:**  The `git.exe` process being involved strongly hints at software development or version control activities.\n\nWhile this doesn't definitively point to malicious behavior, it warrants further investigation. It could be legitimate work but also potentially a sign of:\n\n* **Dependency Updates:** Someone is updating the project and installing new Lodash versions.\n* **Compromise:** An attacker might be using tools like Lodash for malicious purposes or setting up infrastructure within the system. \n\n\n\n**Important Note:** Further analysis would involve examining file contents, user activity logs, and network traffic to determine the true nature of this activity."}
