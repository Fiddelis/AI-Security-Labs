This kind of activity could be a sign of information gathering or preparation for further malicious actions.\n* **File Deletion:**  The deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1` raises concern. Deleting scripts after execution is a common tactic to hide evidence.\n* **Pipe Creation:** The use of pipes (`Pipe Created`) can be used by malware to communicate with other malicious components or evade detection.\n\n\nWhile this activity doesn't definitively prove a breach, the combination of these factors warrants further investigation to determine if truly malicious intent is at play."}
