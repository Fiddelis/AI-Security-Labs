While Chrome downloads files, the high frequency warrants closer inspection to determine if they are legitimate or potentially harmful. \n* **Registry Modifications:** Repeated registry value changes by Chrome can be a sign of malware attempting to alter system settings, persist on the machine, or hide its presence.\n\n**Important Note:** This classification is based solely on the provided log data. A comprehensive investigation would require analyzing file contents, network traffic, and other system indicators to confirm malicious intent."}
