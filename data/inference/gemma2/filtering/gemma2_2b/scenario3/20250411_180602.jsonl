This pattern raises suspicion.\n* **Powershell Activity:**  Powershell is a powerful scripting language often abused by attackers. The fact that `powershell.exe` is accessing processes suggests potential manipulation of system behavior.\n\nWhile this doesn't definitively prove a security breach, the combination of these events warrants further investigation. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have another batch to analyze!"}
