This is likely a normal activity of Windows processes managing settings and configurations.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - A new process `winlogbeat.exe` was created from the `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64` directory, suggesting that winlogbeat was installed or updated recently.\n   - It loaded its executable file (`winlogbeat.exe`).\n   - It created a new log file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`.\n\n4. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process was accessed, likely by another process. This could indicate a script or commandlet running in PowerShell.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The repeated termination of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process might suggest instability with Microsoft Edge updates.\n- The access to `powershell.exe` could potentially indicate the execution of scripts or commands, depending on the context and other system activities. Further investigation is recommended if you suspect malicious activity.\n\n**Normal activities:**\n- Registry changes by `RuntimeBroker.exe`\n- Creation of new processes (`winlogbeat.exe`) and associated files (logs)\n- Network connections made by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` (likely for update checks or downloads)"}
