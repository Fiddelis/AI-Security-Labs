{"file":"events\/scenario6\/20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of events that occurred on your system:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**\n   - A Microsoft Edge update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) was created.\n   - It loaded several DLLs (including `msedgeupdate.dll`).\n   - The process accessed other processes but did not grant any access permissions to them.\n   - The process terminated and attempted to connect to a network, possibly to download updates.\n   - After a few attempts, the process finally terminated successfully.\n\n2. **Windows Update Logs:**\n   - Windows Update logs (`WindowsUpdate.*.etl`) were created in the `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate` folder.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Process:**\n   - A new process called `winlogbeat.exe` was started from the download directory.\n   - This process loaded its executable file and created a log file (`winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`) in its logs directory.\n\nHere are some observations:\n\n- The Microsoft Edge update process seemed to have difficulty terminating successfully, as it attempted to do so multiple times before finally succeeding. However, this could also be due to the logging mechanism itself, and might not necessarily indicate a problem.\n- The appearance of `winlogbeat.exe` indicates that you've installed or started running Winlogbeat, which is an open-source log shipping agent for sending logs from Windows machines to Elasticsearch or Logstash. This could explain why these logs are being generated."}
