The use of `powershell.exe` with `-ep bypass -file`, particularly in combination with non-existing script paths (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`) and the creation of scheduled tasks via `schtasks.exe` suggest an attempt to execute scripts that may not exist or could be dynamically created, a common tactic in obfuscation. Additionally, multiple registry value sets by `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe`, along with unusual activity from `chrome.exe`, further raise suspicion of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms being set up.\"\n}\n```"}
