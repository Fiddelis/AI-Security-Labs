Additionally, there are multiple registry value set events for processes like 'powershell.exe', 'svchost.exe', 'cmd.exe', and 'conhost.exe', which could suggest attempts at persistence or privilege escalation. The creation of files by 'winlogbeat.exe' and 'powershell.exe' also raises concerns about unauthorized changes to system configurations.\"\n}\n```"}
