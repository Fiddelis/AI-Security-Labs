Additionally, suspicious DLLs are loaded by newly created executables (`estrutura_ativo.exe`), which indicates possible attempts at executing arbitrary or unauthorized code. The registry modifications performed by `svchost.exe` and other processes further support this suspicion, as such actions might be indicative of persistent threats trying to alter system configurations.\"\n}\n```"}
