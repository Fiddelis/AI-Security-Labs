Multiple registry value changes via legitimate processes (like `services.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`) suggest possible persistence or privilege escalation techniques. Frequent registry modifications, combined with the use of `powershell.exe` for both accessing and modifying processes, further indicate potential malicious behavior warranting investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
