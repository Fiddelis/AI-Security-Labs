Additionally, there are repeated registry value set actions by various processes like cmd.exe, wmiprvse.exe, conhost.exe, and svchost.exe, often associated with persistence or privilege escalation attempts. The use of powershell.exe for both registry changes and process access also raises red flags as PowerShell is commonly used in advanced persistent threats. These combined activities suggest potential malicious behavior worthy of further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
