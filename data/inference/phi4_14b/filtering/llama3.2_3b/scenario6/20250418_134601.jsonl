Additionally, the same process attempts to create or modify files in locations like User Data and Download Service directories, indicating potential manipulation or exploitation. The repeated loading of system DLLs (amsi.dll and urlmon.dll) by chrome.exe raises suspicion of possible privilege escalation or injection attacks. Lastly, simultaneous creation of '.winlogbeat.yml.new' by winlogbeat.exe and ETW logs indicates automation or orchestration that could be linked to broader malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
