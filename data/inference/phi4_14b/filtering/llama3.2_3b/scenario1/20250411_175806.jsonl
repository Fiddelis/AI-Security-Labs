The creation of startup entries in the registry for executables ('estrutura_principal.exe' and 'pacote_temporario.exe') suggests an attempt to persist malware. Additionally, the use of 'cmd.exe' to modify the registry and the file creation by PowerShell point towards script-based automation typically used in attacks.\"\n}\n```"}
