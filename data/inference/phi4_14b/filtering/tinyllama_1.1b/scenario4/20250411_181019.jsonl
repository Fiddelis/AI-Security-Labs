The use of 'powershell.exe' and 'sc.exe' to create processes or access registry values, particularly with a non-existing script path ('componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'), is indicative of potential privilege escalation attempts or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, repeated 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)' actions by 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'svchost.exe', and excessive use by 'chrome.exe' could suggest unauthorized modifications to the system configuration.
