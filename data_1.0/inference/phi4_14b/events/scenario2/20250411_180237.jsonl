Additionally, there are numerous events related to 'Registry value set' tasks from various processes including `conhost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and multiple instances of `powershell.exe`. These activities could indicate attempts at persistence or privilege escalation. Furthermore, the frequent file creation by `winlogbeat.exe` might suggest tampering or data exfiltration attempts. The combination of these events merits further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
