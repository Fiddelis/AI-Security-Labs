The use of cmd.exe to query the system's disk enumeration paths alongside systeminfo.exe loading unusual libraries such as amsi.dll may indicate privilege escalation attempts or information gathering. WmiPrvSE.exe process creation with specific command-line arguments suggests potential misuse of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for lateral movement. Moreover, the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files in an unconventional location hints at possible security tool tampering.\"\n}\n```"}
