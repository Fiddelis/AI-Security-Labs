These logs capture various events such as process executions, file creations, image loads, registry value changes, and user account management actions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the different types of entries:\n\n1. **Process Events:**\n   - Logs when specific processes (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`, `chrome.exe`) are executed or perform certain tasks like loading images (`ImageLoad`).\n   \n2. **File Operations:**\n   - Tracks file creation events, such as a new file being created at a specified path (`FileCreate`). For example, `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n\n3. **Registry Events:**\n   - Captures changes to the Windows registry by processes like `chrome.exe` or `svchost.exe`, indicating when a registry value is set.\n\n4. **User Account Management:**\n   - Logs events related to user account management activities, although details of these actions are not provided in the logs.\n\n5. **DNS Queries:**\n   - Records DNS query activities performed by processes like `chrome.exe`.\n\n6. **System and Application Events:**\n   - Includes system-related events such as loading system libraries (`urlmon.dll`, `combase.dll`) by applications like `smartscreen.exe` or `OneDriveLauncher.exe`.\n\nThese logs are useful for monitoring the behavior of a system, troubleshooting issues, and detecting potential security incidents. They can be analyzed to understand which processes are interacting with files and registry entries, as well as track user-related activities on the machine."}
