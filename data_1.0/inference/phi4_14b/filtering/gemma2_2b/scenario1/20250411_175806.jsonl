Additionally, commands executed via 'cmd.exe' and 'reg.exe' suggest attempts to modify the system's startup behavior by adding entries in 'HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run', a common tactic for ensuring persistence of malware. The presence of unusual file creation events involving 'winlogbeat.exe' could also point towards tampering with logging tools, potentially to hide malicious activities.\"\n}\n```"}
