The use of temporary files and directories (e.g., AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp) is also a common tactic for attackers to evade detection.  The unusual use of `calc.exe` with `urlmon.dll` warrants investigation.  While some events appear benign (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`, `chrome.exe`), the combination with the other suspicious events elevates the risk profile.\"\n}\n```"}
