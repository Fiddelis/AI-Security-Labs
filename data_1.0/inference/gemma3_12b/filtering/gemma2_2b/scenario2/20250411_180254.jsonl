Multiple processes (powershell, cmd, reg) are interacting with the registry, and systeminfo.exe is being invoked, which could be indicative of reconnaissance or information gathering before malicious actions.  The loading of AMSI and MPOAV DLLs by systeminfo.exe suggests an attempt to evade detection. Creation of EVTX files and interactions with winlogbeat also raise flags.\"\n}\n```"}
