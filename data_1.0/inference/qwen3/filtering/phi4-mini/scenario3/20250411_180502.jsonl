{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario3\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is relevant for investigation. First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries. There are multiple events related to chrome.exe making DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, but repeated network connections might be suspicious. Then there's powershell.exe doing registry value sets and process accesses. PowerShell is often used in scripts, so that's not inherently bad, but combined with other actions...\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs. Some of these are legitimate system files, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. However, there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is part of antivirus. Then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory, which could be a script. The file path has .ps1, indicating a PowerShell script. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be a sign of something trying to execute code without leaving traces.\n\nNext, there are multiple Start-Process commands from PowerShell, launching different .bat files. These batch files are in various directories, some with names like \"estrutura_auxiliar\" and \"modulo_logico_script\". The paths seem a bit odd, maybe obfuscated. The use of multiple .bat files and the way they're called via PowerShell could indicate some automated or scripted activity.\n\nAlso, there's a Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That's probably benign, but combined with other events, it's part of a larger pattern. The presence of multiple registry changes, process accesses, and image loads might suggest a process trying to modify the system or execute payloads.\n\nThe Pipe Created events and Provider Lifecycle tasks might be part of communication between processes or services. The fact that there are multiple entries with similar patterns could indicate a coordinated effort, possibly from a script or malware.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell activity, registry changes, network connections, and file operations in temporary directories raises red flags. These actions could be part of a malicious script trying to establish persistence, exfiltrate data, or execute payloads. The use of multiple .bat files and the obfuscated paths might be attempts to evade detection. Therefore, this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activity (registry modifications, process access, image loads, and file operations) combined with network connections and obfuscated script execution patterns, which could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence, data exfiltration, or exploitation attempts.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario3\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a batch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The answer should be a JSON object with \"CLASSIFICATION\" as either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING and a \"JUSTIFICATION\" explaining why.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to spot any suspicious patterns. Let's start by looking at the processes involved. The first event is cmd.exe executing a batch file from a path that seems a bit odd: \"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". The use of cmd.exe to run a batch file isn't inherently malicious, but the path might be a red flag if it's not a standard location. \n\nNext, there's a process access to powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, so that's a point to note. Then, multiple registry value set events. The processes involved here are cmd.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and chrome.exe. Setting registry values can be part of normal operations, but if done by unusual processes or in sensitive locations, it could be malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a chrome.exe process loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are Windows Defender components, so that's normal. However, the same chrome.exe is also setting registry values repeatedly. The repeated registry modifications might be a sign of something trying to persist or modify system settings.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe creating a file in a specific path. The file path seems legitimate, but svchost is a system process, so creating files might be normal. However, the user's own processes like powershell.exe creating files in the Downloads directory could be benign, but if those files are being used for something else, it's worth checking.\n\nThe presence of multiple file creations and registry changes across different processes might indicate a script or tool attempting to establish persistence or modify the system. The batch file executed by cmd.exe could be the entry point for a larger operation. Also, the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe could be an attempt to alter settings or create backdoors.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe together. Sometimes, attackers use these tools in combination to execute scripts or commands. The fact that multiple processes are modifying the registry and creating files could be part of a multi-stage attack. However, without more context, like the exact registry keys modified or the content of the batch file, it's hard to be certain. But given the combination of these events, it's a strong indicator that something is trying to manipulate the system, which would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious registry modifications across processes (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe), file creations in user directories, and unusual process interactions that could indicate persistence or configuration changes. The combination of registry edits and file operations suggests potential malicious activity warranting investigation.\"\n}"}
