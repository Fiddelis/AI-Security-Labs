{"file":"data\/filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/scenario4\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event and note any suspicious activities. The first event is about MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process, but the rule is NetworkConnect. Not sure yet. Then there's chrome.exe with a DNS query, which is normal. \n\nNext, powershell.exe has a ProcessAccess event. That's not necessarily bad, but combined with other events... Then there's a RegistryEvent where powershell.exe sets a registry value. Could be benign or part of a configuration. \n\nThe cmd.exe process creation with a command line that adds a user and adds to Domain Admins stands out. That's definitely suspicious. The command line uses net user and net group with domain flags, which are often used in domain administration. The username and password have patterns like \"unidade_comum_Admin\" and \"registro_temporario_pass123!\", which might be part of a credential stuffing attempt or creating a backdoor account.\n\nAnother cmd.exe process sets a registry value again. Then there's net1.exe and net.exe being used to add users and groups. Net1.exe isn't a standard Windows tool, which is a red flag. The command lines are similar to the previous ones, suggesting multiple attempts to create domain users and add them to admin groups. \n\nThe winlogbeat.exe is creating files, which might be part of a log collection tool, but the paths are in user downloads, which could be normal. However, the presence of multiple process creations and registry changes, especially those related to domain admin accounts, points towards a possible lateral movement or privilege escalation attempt. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple processes attempting to create domain users and add them to admin groups, using non-standard executables like net1.exe. This could be part of a malicious campaign to gain domain admin access. The combination of these events indicates a potential security threat, so the classification should be INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious process creations (cmd.exe, net1.exe, net.exe) with commands attempting to add domain users to admin groups, along with registry modifications and network activity. Non-standard tools like net1.exe and repetitive domain admin account manipulation patterns indicate potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\"\n}"}
