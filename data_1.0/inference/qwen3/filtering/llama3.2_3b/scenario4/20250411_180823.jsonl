The user provided a batch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're relevant for investigation. Let me start by looking through each event to see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. That's a normal process, but maybe it's part of something else. Then there's a cmd.exe creating scheduled tasks with names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command line uses schtasks to create tasks that run calc.exe. Wait, creating scheduled tasks with names that have numbers and underscores might be suspicious. Also, the command line uses \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" which is a bit odd because calc.exe is a legitimate program, but using schtasks to run it on logon or startup could be a way to persist. \n\nAnother event shows cmd.exe setting registry values. Registry changes can be part of malware persistence. Then there's schtasks.exe creating more tasks, like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" which runs calc.exe again. The file created by svchost.exe is in the Tasks directory, which might be related to these scheduled tasks. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of registry value sets and file creations. Chrome.exe is also involved in registry changes, but that's normal. However, the repeated registry changes and the creation of scheduled tasks with specific names might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. \n\nThe presence of multiple schtasks.exe processes creating tasks that run calc.exe could be a red herring or part of a larger payload. The fact that these tasks are created with system privileges (like \/ru system) might be a sign of malicious intent. Also, the file created by svchost.exe in the Tasks directory might be a backdoor or a script that's being set up.\n\nPowerShell is creating a file called unidade_ativo.txt, which could be a script or a configuration file. The repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might be trying to hide or modify certain settings. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating scheduled tasks, modifying registry values, and creating files in the Tasks directory suggests that there's an attempt to establish persistence. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate process, the way it's being used in these tasks and the associated file creations and registry changes point towards potential malicious activity. The batch seems to be part of a larger attack plan, so it's relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities: creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names that execute calc.exe, registry modifications, and file creations in system directories. These actions suggest potential persistence mechanisms and could indicate malicious behavior attempting to establish long-term system access.\"\n}"}
