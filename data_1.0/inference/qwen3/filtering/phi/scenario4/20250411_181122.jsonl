There are several entries with PowerShell.exe. The first few events show ProcessAccess and Registry value set actions. Then there's an ImageLoad event for some DLLs. Then a command line that uses findstr to search for \"pass\" in various file types, which might be looking for passwords. That's suspicious because searching for passwords in files could indicate a credential harvesting attempt.\n\nAnother event has a command line with schtasks.exe deleting scheduled tasks, which might be part of cleaning up or removing traces of malware. Also, there's a mention of \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and similar task names, which could be obfuscated names for malicious tasks. \n\nThe presence of multiple Registry value sets and Dns queries might be part of a larger attack, like establishing a C2 (command and control) connection. Also, the use of findstr and select-string with password patterns is a red flag for searching for sensitive information. \n\nHowever, some of the events are from common processes like notepad.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe, which might be normal. But the combination of PowerShell commands, scheduled task deletions, and registry changes could indicate malicious activity. The fact that there are multiple instances of these actions might suggest an ongoing or persistent threat. \n\nI should check if there's a pattern of lateral movement or data exfiltration. The findstr command searching for passwords could be part of a data exfiltration attempt. Also, the use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks might be removing evidence of prior activity. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch seems to involve suspicious PowerShell activities, credential searching, and scheduled task manipulation, which are all indicators of potential malicious behavior. So, the classification should be INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activities (ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad) combined with credential-searching commands (findstr\/powershell with password pattern) and scheduled task deletion (schtasks.exe), indicating potential credential harvesting or persistence mechanisms.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. I need to analyze all the events together, not individually. Let me start by going through each event and noting any suspicious activities.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe with a registry object added or deleted. Svchost is a legitimate system process, but registry changes could be benign or malicious. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate file, so probably safe.\n\nThen cmd.exe setting a registry value. Cmd.exe is common, but changing registry keys might be part of normal operations or a sign of malware. Need to check more.\n\nConhost.exe also setting registry values. Conhost is a legitimate process, but again, registry changes could be risky.\n\nPowerShell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used in both legitimate and malicious contexts. Multiple accesses might indicate something, but not conclusive.\n\nWMIC.exe deleting notepad.exe. Wait, deleting a process via WMIC could be a red flag. But notepad.exe is a legitimate process. Maybe a decoy?\n\nWhoami.exe being run. That's a normal command for checking user permissions, so probably safe.\n\nNet.exe deleting a user account. Deleting a user could be part of normal admin tasks, but if it's a non-existent user or done without authorization, it's suspicious. The command line here is deleting \"componente_comum_Admin\", which might be a custom user account. That could be a sign of account deletion, possibly to remove traces.\n\nSc.exe deleting a service, \"win32times\". Deleting a service might be normal, but again, depends on context. The service name seems odd, maybe a typo or a malicious service.\n\nCmd.exe running commands to delete temporary files. The command line includes deleting files in the temp directory. This could be part of cleaning up after a process, but the presence of decoded.exe in the path might indicate something. The user is deleting files, which could be part of a cleanup, but combined with other events, maybe not.\n\nPowerShell.exe and cmd.exe are being used frequently. The multiple registry value sets could be part of a configuration change or a malware attempting to persist.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a line with \"del %%temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\". The decoded.exe part might be a clue. Also, the use of WMIC to delete processes and sc.exe to delete services could be part of a cleanup or removal of something.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry changes, especially with processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe, might indicate an attempt to modify system settings. Also, the use of WMIC and sc.exe to delete services and processes could be part of a malware uninstallation or a script to remove itself.\n\nHowever, some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of multiple registry changes, process deletions, and service deletions might suggest a coordinated effort, possibly by an attacker. The fact that some commands are trying to delete files and services could indicate the presence of malware that's cleaning up after itself.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated use of PowerShell for process access and registry changes. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The multiple instances might be part of a script or a malware that's using PowerShell to execute commands.\n\nAlso, the command line in some processes includes \"powershell.exe & {}\", which might be a placeholder or a way to execute arbitrary code. The use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" in the log might indicate some internal system processes, but again, not sure.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several suspicious activities: multiple registry changes, process deletions, service deletions, and the use of PowerShell and WMIC for these actions. These could be signs of a malware attempting to remove itself or modify the system. However, without more context, it's possible that some of these are legitimate. But given the combination and the presence of decoded files, it's more likely that there's a malicious activity here. Therefore, the batch is relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event log exhibits **multiple suspicious activities** that collectively suggest **potential malicious activity**, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Registry Manipulation**:\n   - Frequent changes to registry values via `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` could indicate attempts to **modify system settings, persistence mechanisms, or hide malicious processes**.\n\n2. **Process Deletion via WMIC**:\n   - The command `WMIC.exe \/c del process` targeting `notepad.exe` (a legitimate process) is **odd**. While WMIC is a legitimate tool, deleting processes in this manner could be part of **malware cleanup** or a red herring.\n\n3. **User Account Deletion**:\n   - `net.exe` is used to delete the user account `componente_comum_Admin`. This could be **legitimate administrative activity**, but the account name is non-standard, raising suspicion of **removing evidence or cleaning up after a compromise**.\n\n4. **Service Deletion via SC.exe**:\n   - Deleting the service `win32times` (likely a typo for `win32time` or a custom service name) could be **malicious cleanup** or a **false flag** to mislead investigators.\n\n5. **Temporary File Deletion**:\n   - The `cmd.exe` command deletes files like `unidade_temporario_calc.txt` and `estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe` from the temp directory. The presence of `.exe` in the filename suggests **potential malware files** being cleaned up.\n\n6. **PowerShell Abuses**:\n   - PowerShell is used for **process access**, **registry changes**, and **command execution**. While common in legitimate scripts, the **repeated use** and **unusual command lines** (e.g., `powershell.exe & {}`) could indicate **malicious scripts** or **remote code execution**.\n\n7. **Unusual Command Lines**:\n   - Commands like `del %%temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt` and `del %%temp%%\\\\estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe` suggest **file deletion** in the temp directory, which could be part of **malware cleanup** or **exfiltration** attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Persistence\/Removal**: The combination of registry changes, process\/service deletions, and file cleanup suggests **malware attempting to remove itself or evade detection**.\n- **Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movement**: Deleting user accounts and services could be part of **privilege escalation** or **lateral movement** tactics.\n- **Scripted Attack**: The use of PowerShell and WMIC in repetitive commands points to **scripted automation**, which is common in advanced threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Deleted Files**:\n   - Check if `estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe` or other deleted files were **malicious** or part of a **payload**.\n2. **Audit Registry Changes**:\n   - Review the specific registry keys modified to determine if they were **altered for persistence, configuration, or evasion**.\n3. **Check for Hidden Processes**:\n   - Use tools like `Process Explorer` or `Sysmon` to detect **hidden or anomalous processes**.\n4. **Analyze PowerShell Logs**:\n   - Examine PowerShell activity logs for **unauthorized script execution** or **command injection**.\n5. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Use antivirus\/EDR tools to scan the system for **unknown threats** or **signatureless malware**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe event log contains **multiple red flags** that align with **malicious activity**, including registry manipulation, process\/service deletions, and PowerShell abuses. While some actions could be legitimate, the **combination and context** strongly suggest **a potential compromise**. A thorough investigation is necessary to confirm the threat and mitigate risks. \n\n**Answer:** The batch is **relevant for investigation** due to suspicious activities indicating potential malware activity."}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The answer should be a single classification with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event to see what's happening. The first event is about PowerShell setting a registry value. Then there's a file created by PowerShell in the Temp directory. Another event shows PowerShell executing a command, maybe a script. There's also process access events for PowerShell, which could indicate it's interacting with other processes.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat, which seems like a legitimate tool. Another PowerShell process accessing a process, then whoami.exe being run, which is a common command for checking user permissions. RuntimeBroker.exe modifying a registry, calc.exe loading a DLL, svchost.exe changing a registry, and chrome.exe making a DNS query.\n\nNow, I need to see if these events together suggest malicious activity. The presence of multiple PowerShell events might be a red flag, especially if they're modifying registry values or creating files. The file created by PowerShell in the Temp directory could be a script, possibly malicious. However, some of these actions could be part of normal operations. For example, svchost.exe and chrome.exe are legitimate processes. The whoami.exe and calc.exe are also common.\n\nBut the combination of multiple PowerShell events, registry changes, and file creation in Temp might indicate a potential threat. However, without more context, like the exact commands or if there's any suspicious activity beyond what's listed, it's a bit ambiguous. The user might be testing if I can spot a pattern. Since there are several PowerShell activities and some registry changes, which are often used in malware, the batch could be interesting for further investigation. But I need to make sure there's enough to warrant it. The presence of multiple events from PowerShell and some unusual registry accesses might make it INTERESTING. However, if it's a normal system activity, maybe not. But given the variety of events, I think the classification should be INTERESTING because there's enough suspicious activity to warrant closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events (registry modifications, file creation, process access) combined with suspicious process interactions suggest potential malicious activity warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
