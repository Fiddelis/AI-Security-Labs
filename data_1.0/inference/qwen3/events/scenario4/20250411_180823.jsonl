So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries related to Chrome.exe making network connections. That's normal, but there are a lot of them. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe setting registry values. Maybe that's part of normal operations, but I need to check further.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell.exe processes, there's a ProcessAccess event. Not sure if that's suspicious, but combined with other actions... Then there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a system DLL, so maybe not a big deal. But then there's a cmd.exe creating scheduled tasks with names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command line uses schtasks to create tasks that run calc.exe. Wait, creating scheduled tasks with names that have numbers and underscores might be a red flag. Also, the command line in the cmd.exe process has a long string with schtasks commands. That seems like it's setting up tasks to run calc.exe on logon and startup. \n\nThen there's schtasks.exe creating more tasks, like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" and \"pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\". The paths for these tasks are in the System32\\Tasks directory, which is normal, but the names are oddly constructed. Also, svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times, which could be part of normal system operations, but combined with the task creation, it might be suspicious.\n\nThe file created by svchost.exe is in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\, which is a valid location, but the names of the files might be obfuscated. Also, the use of schtasks to create tasks that run calc.exe seems like a way to persistently run commands. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate program, the method of using scheduled tasks to execute it might be part of a larger attack. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch seems to involve creating multiple scheduled tasks with unusual names, modifying registry values, and using processes like cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to set up these tasks. This could be an attempt to establish persistence on the system. The combination of these events suggests that there's a coordinated effort to create tasks that might execute arbitrary commands, which is a common technique in malware. Therefore, this batch is relevant for investigation as it shows potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious process creations (cmd.exe, schtasks.exe) with obfuscated task names, registry modifications, and file creations in system directories. These actions suggest potential persistence mechanisms and could indicate malicious activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario4\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. The events involve various processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The winlog entries mention tasks like Registry value set, Process accessed, Pipe Created, File created, Image loaded, and Process Create.\n\nLooking at the registry value sets, multiple instances of chrome.exe and powershell.exe are modifying registry values. That could be normal, but repeated modifications might indicate something else. The presence of powershell.exe is notable because it's often used in scripting and can be a vector for attacks. \n\nThere's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new and another for unidade_ativo.txt. These files might be part of legitimate processes, but the fact that they're created by chrome.exe or powershell.exe could be suspicious. Also, the ImageLoad events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll might be related to security software, but the context here isn't clear. \n\nThe whoami.exe execution by powershell.exe could be a sign of reconnaissance. The multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe might be an attempt to persist or alter system settings. The combination of these actions—especially if they're all happening in a short timeframe—could indicate malicious activity, such as a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration. \n\nHowever, some of these could be benign. For example, chrome.exe might be legitimately modifying registry entries for extensions or settings. The file creations might be part of normal operations. But the repetition and the use of powershell.exe, which is a common tool in attacks, raise red flags. \n\nConsidering the entire batch, the pattern of multiple registry changes, file creations, and process accesses by various processes, especially with powershell.exe, suggests that there's a potential security incident. The combination of these events, even if some are normal, when taken together, points towards something worth investigating. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with suspicious file creations and process accesses, suggest potential malicious activity or persistence attempts.\"\n}"}
