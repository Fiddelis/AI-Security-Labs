{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user provided a batch of JSONL logs, and I need to determine if they're relevant for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning through each event. The first few entries are about chrome.exe making DNS queries and network connections. That's normal browser activity, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a powershell.exe process. \n\nLooking closer, the PowerShell process has a command line that includes several commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and others. These commands are typically used for user and group management, checking local users, and listing credentials. That could be part of a reconnaissance phase, maybe someone trying to gather info about the system.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory, which is deleted shortly after. The file path seems to be a PowerShell script, which might be a sign of malicious activity, like a script trying to execute something. The fact that it's created and deleted quickly could indicate an attempt to run code without leaving traces.\n\nAlso, multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. While loading DLLs is normal, the combination with the previous commands might suggest that the PowerShell process is loading modules or executing code that's part of a larger attack. \n\nThere are several ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent entries. Changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms. The repeated NetworkConnect events from Chrome might be part of the same attack, maybe exfiltrating data or establishing a connection to a C2 server.\n\nPutting it all together, the PowerShell process is doing a lot of system checks, creating and deleting a script file, and loading various DLLs. This combination of actions is suspicious and could indicate reconnaissance, credential harvesting, or a potential malware execution. The presence of multiple events related to the same process and the unusual file operations make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activity including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, and multiple network connection events. The combination of process creation, image loading, and system command execution suggests potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event to see what's going on. Let's start by scanning through the entries. \n\nThe first event mentions PowerShell.exe creating a pipe. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Next, there's a PowerShell command line that seems to be running several commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, and listing user directories. That looks suspicious because these commands are often used for enumeration, which is a common step in reconnaissance during a cyber attack. \n\nAnother event shows PowerShell loading an image, possibly a DLL. Then there's net.exe being executed with the user command, which could be checking for user accounts. There's also a process named net1.exe, which might be a renamed or malicious executable. \n\nPowerShell is again used to create a file named pacote_ativo.txt, which could be a script or data file. Chrome.exe is making multiple registry value changes, which might be part of persistence or modifying settings. \n\nThen there's another PowerShell image load, and SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll. Updater.exe creating a pipe, and a long command line for updater.exe with some URLs. Cmdkey.exe is being run to list credentials, which is a red flag for credential dumping. \n\nThere are multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and the initial command line with net user and cmdkey.exe \/list. Also, events related to security group and user account management without any process names, which might indicate attempts to modify group memberships or user accounts.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands for enumeration, credential dumping (cmdkey.exe), suspicious file creations, and unusual process executions (like net1.exe) suggests potential malicious activity. The combination of these events points towards a possible reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempt. The repeated registry changes by Chrome.exe might be part of persistence or malware activity. The updater.exe with the long command line could be part of a larger attack chain. \n\nSince the events collectively indicate suspicious behavior, the classification should be INTERESTING. The justification needs to be concise, mentioning the suspicious commands, credential dumping, unusual processes, and potential reconnaissance activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell commands (net user, cmdkey.exe \/list, directory enumeration) combined with unusual process creations (net1.exe, updater.exe) and credential dumping activities indicate potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The answer should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the events. There are a lot of entries. The first few entries have \"task\": \"Security Group Management\" with process and file as None. That might be normal system activity, maybe related to group policy or something similar. But then there's an entry with SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, but sometimes malicious actors might use similar names. However, loading combase.dll from System32 seems normal.\n\nNext, there's a process create event for net.exe with the command line \"localgroup\". That's a bit suspicious because \"localgroup\" is a command used to manage local groups, which could be part of adding users to groups, which is a common technique in attacks. Then there's a powershell.exe process accessing a file, which could be part of executing a script. \n\nAnother entry is net1.exe creating a process with the command line \"net1 localgroup\". Wait, net1.exe isn't a standard Windows tool. That's a red flag. Maybe a renamed or malicious executable. The command line is trying to use localgroup, which again points to modifying group memberships.\n\nThen there's a file created by PowerShell in the AppData directory. PowerShell creating files in AppData could be part of persistence or storing malicious scripts. The registry value set by PowerShell might be modifying settings to ensure persistence or change behavior.\n\nAnother entry is SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Maybe that's part of a larger process. Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file in Downloads. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for logging, but if it's creating files in a user's download directory, maybe it's part of some activity. \n\nAnother PowerShell file creation in Downloads, then MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe with a command line that includes \/ua \/installsource scheduler. That seems like a legitimate update process, but the command line might be part of a scheduled task. \n\nsvchost.exe modifying registry values, which is common but could be part of a larger attack. MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is related to task scheduling. BackgroundTaskHost.exe loading urlmon.dll again. \n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are multiple instances of PowerShell accessing files, creating files, and modifying registry values. The use of net.exe and net1.exe (which isn't standard) along with the localgroup command suggests attempts to modify user groups, which is a common attack vector for privilege escalation. The repeated file creations in user directories and the registry changes could indicate persistence mechanisms. \n\nHowever, some of these could be benign, like legitimate updates or normal system processes. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities, especially the use of net1.exe (non-standard) and the focus on localgroup management, raises concerns. The presence of PowerShell in these actions also points towards script-based attacks. \n\nI need to check if there's a clear malicious intent. The localgroup command is often used in attacks to add users to administrators or other privileged groups. The creation of files in AppData and Downloads could be for storing malicious payloads or scripts. The registry modifications might be to ensure the malware runs on startup or changes system settings. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch seems to have multiple indicators of potential malicious activity. Even if some actions are normal, the combination and the specific commands used (like localgroup with non-standard executables) make this batch interesting for further investigation. Therefore, the answer should be INTERESTING with a justification that highlights the suspicious activities and potential for privilege escalation or persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n**INTERESTING**  \nThe batch contains multiple suspicious activities, including the use of non-standard executables like `net1.exe` (which is not a legitimate Windows tool) and commands targeting local group management (`localgroup`). PowerShell is heavily involved in file creation and registry modifications, which could indicate persistence or script-based attacks. The combination of these actions, along with repeated file creations in user directories and registry changes, suggests potential privilege escalation or malicious persistence mechanisms. While some processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are legitimate, the context of their use here raises red flags for further investigation."}
