{"file":"data\/events\/scenario2\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a batch of log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to see what's happening. Let me start by looking for any suspicious activities or patterns. \n\nThe first event mentions PowerShell.exe setting a registry value. Then there's a cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task using schtasks, which runs a PowerShell script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a red flag because it's trying to execute a script that isn't present, which could be a sign of a malicious payload. \n\nNext, there's another process where schtasks.exe is creating a task again, this time with a different script path (entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1). Both of these tasks are being created with the same user account (system), which is a bit unusual. The fact that the scripts don't exist might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute something else, maybe a staged payload or a downloader.\n\nThen, there are multiple registry value set events from svchost.exe and other processes. While svchost is a legitimate system process, repeatedly modifying registry values could be part of a persistence mechanism. Also, a file is created in the Tasks directory with the name win32times, which might be a scheduled task file. \n\nAnother event shows a process trying to query the scheduled task, which is part of the attack chain. The presence of multiple registry modifications and file creations by various processes, especially when combined with the use of PowerShell and schtasks, suggests an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, there are some file creations by winlogbeat.exe and PowerShell, but those might be benign if they're part of a legitimate tool. However, the key here is the combination of events. The use of PowerShell with bypass execution policy, creating scheduled tasks that reference non-existent scripts, and modifying registry values points towards a potential attack. \n\nI should also check if there's any lateral movement or other suspicious activities. The presence of multiple registry changes and the use of schtasks to run PowerShell commands are common in malware campaigns. The fact that the scripts don't exist suggests that the attacker might be trying to execute something else, possibly a downloader or a payload that's not present in the logs. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch seems to involve suspicious activities that could be part of a malicious operation. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with a justification that highlights the use of PowerShell, scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts, and registry modifications as indicators of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell execution via schtasks with non-existent scripts, registry modifications, and potential persistence mechanisms, indicating possible adversarial activity.\"\n}"}
