I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process being accessed, which isn't too unusual on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe process creating a service with some commands. The command line looks suspicious because it mentions creating a service that runs a script from \"c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Since the path doesn't exist, this could be an attempt to execute malicious code or create a persistence mechanism.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where different processes like cmd.exe and services.exe set registry values. These could be related to creating or modifying system configurations, possibly for persistence or to drop files later.\n\nThen I see sc.exe being used to create and query the status of a service. Again, this aligns with setting up a malicious service on the system.\n\nThere are instances where notepad.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe access registry values, which might be part of legitimate operations but could also indicate reconnaissance or configuration changes by an attacker.\n\nThe calc.exe and Calculator.exe entries load urlmon.dll, which is a known DLL for handling URLs. This isn't inherently malicious, but sometimes attackers use such components to hide their activities or for certain payloads.\n\nThere's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe, which might be part of logging setup. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nMultiple powershell.exe accesses are logged. While PowerShell is a common tool, repeated access could be suspicious, especially if combined with other events.\n\nLastly, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll is normal for script injection detection, so no issue there.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows several processes attempting to create or interact with services using cmd and sc.exe, which is concerning. The use of non-existent scripts in the command lines suggests potential malicious activity, possibly part of an attack chain like initial access or persistence setup. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of cmd.exe and sc.exe creating services with non-existent scripts, indicating potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or payload execution.\"\n}"}
