{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario3\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from Chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. These seem normal because browsers typically make such connections for browsing the web. There are five events like that, which don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nNext, there's an event from powershell.exe accessing something, but without seeing the command line, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just a legitimate script execution. I'll keep that in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThen, whoami.exe being executed with its command line doesn't seem suspicious on first glance. It's often used for debugging or by legitimate scripts to check user permissions.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing something again without more context—maybe it's related to the previous one, but I need to see if there's a pattern.\n\nA cmd.exe process running a specific command stands out. The command is creating a service using sc.exe with parameters like start=auto and type=Own. This might be concerning because setting services to auto-start can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. I should pay attention here.\n\nLooking further, more powershell.exe events indicate repeated accesses. Combined with the previous cmd.exe activity, this could mean someone is trying to establish persistence across reboots.\n\nThere are several sc.exe and services.exe processes creating and starting tasks. These activities involve registry changes (Registry value set). Creating new services or tasks in the Registry can be legitimate for system administration but can also be a tactic for installing backdoors or malware. The fact that multiple services are being created with specific names like \"modulo_geral\" and paths pointing to various .exe files might indicate malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, the image load events from processes loading known DLLs related to .NET frameworks don't seem suspicious by themselves but could be part of a larger payload execution.\n\nI also see that cmd.exe is being used again for another Registry change. Repeated modifications in the Registry without clear justification could be red flags, especially when combined with service creation activities.\n\nLooking at all these events together: multiple instances of creating services and tasks using sc.exe and cmd.exe, powershell accesses, andRegistry changes—this pattern suggests possible unauthorized system configuration changes. These behaviors are often associated with malware or attacker persistence mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, considering the entire batch, there's a combination of activities that raise concerns about potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of command-line tools to create services and modify Registry entries is particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activity, including repeated creation of services using sc.exe, powershell.exe process accesses, and numerous registry modifications. These activities suggest possible unauthorized system changes or persistence mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario3\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Each line is a JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from different processes. Let's break them down:\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe** creating files: This seems like it could be normal behavior since winlogbeat is a log shipping tool. It might be setting up or updating its configuration file, which isn't unusual.\n\n2. **powershell.exe** with registry and process access events: PowerShell can do a lot of things, but accessing processes and modifying the registry are common tasks. However, without more context, these actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious.\n\n3. **RuntimeBroker.exe** setting registry values: Runtime Broker is part of Windows and handles various runtime services. Registry modifications here might be standard operations, so not immediately concerning.\n\n4. **notepad.exe** writing to the registry: Notepad isn't typically used for malicious activities, but it's unusual for a simple text editor to interact with the registry unless the user is doing something specific.\n\n5. **calc.exe** loading urlmon.dll: Calculator using an external DLL could be odd. URLMON.DLL is related to handling URLs and might not have any legitimate use in Calc. This could be a red flag, possibly indicating a malicious payload.\n\n6. Multiple entries from **svchost.exe** modifying the registry: Svchost runs many Windows services. Registry changes here are common but without specifics on which service, it's hard to say if they're suspicious.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, while most events seem benign or part of normal system operations, the calc.exe loading urlmon.dll stands out. This could be an indicator of a malicious activity, such as a calculator used for something more nefarious by leveraging additional modules. The combination with other powershell and svchost activities might suggest script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, despite most events being normal, the use of calc.exe with an unusual DLL load raises concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple entries from known legitimate processes like powershell.exe and svchost.exe modifying the registry. However, there is a notable event where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll, which could indicate potential malicious activity. This combination suggests possible investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
