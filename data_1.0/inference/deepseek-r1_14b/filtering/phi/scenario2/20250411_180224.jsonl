{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi\/scenario2\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is a process creation of cmd.exe with a command line that looks suspicious. It's using schtasks to create a new task scheduled daily, running as the system user. The task runs powershell.exe with some arguments, including -ep bypass which I know is used to bypass execution policies. But wait, the script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. That file doesn't exist, so maybe it's a typo or an attempt to execute malicious code.\n\nNext, there are two events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process but unusual when it writes to the registry without good reason. Could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen another schtasks.exe creating a task and loading taskschd.dll, which seems normal for scheduled tasks, but combined with previous events, I'm keeping an eye on it.\n\nConhost.exe setting a registry value is next. Conhost is often used by command-line tools, but again, why is it accessing the registry? Maybe another persistence method.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in its directory is fine unless there's something malicious about the tool itself. I don't think so, but maybe logs are being manipulated.\n\nPowershell.exe creating a file named estrutura_geral.txt could be innocent or part of script execution. But combined with earlier powershell usage, it might indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple chrome.exe events accessing registry values. Chrome sometimes does that for extensions or settings, so not sure if this is suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother winlogbeat and powershell event follow the same patterns as before.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe running a scheduled task with powershell in bypass mode points towards potential malicious activity. The non-existing script might be a red flag. Also, svchost.exe and conhost.exe modifying registry values could be installing backdoors or persistence mechanisms. Powershell is often used for attacks, especially when combined with execution bypass.\n\nSo overall, the combination of these events suggests possible unauthorized access, malware installation, or malicious scripts running on the system. This batch definitely warrants a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activities including cmd.exe creating a scheduled task with powershell in bypass mode targeting a non-existing script, multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and conhost.exe, and repeated chrome.exe events. These indicators suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized access.\"\n}\n```"}
