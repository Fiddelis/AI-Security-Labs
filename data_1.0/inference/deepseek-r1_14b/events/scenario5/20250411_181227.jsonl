{"file":"data\/events\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve powershell.exe being executed with some command lines that look like they're creating scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. Each event has a different task name ending with $object, but they all execute calc.exe at logon as Administrators with highest run level. That seems suspicious because creating multiple tasks to run calc.exe could be an attempt to persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is just being executed without any command line specified, which might mean it's running in a different way or maybe not doing anything malicious on its own. But considering the previous events, it's part of the same pattern.\n\nThere are some registry access events and process accesses logged, but those alone aren't enough to conclude anything yet. The chrome.exe entries seem unrelated since they're about pipes and registry changes which could be normal activity.\n\nThe later events show powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components, which is expected when running PowerShell scripts that involve .NET. However, combined with the scheduled task creations, it raises a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to create persistence mechanisms.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple instances of creating scheduled tasks using PowerShell to execute calc.exe at logon as Administrators suggests potential malicious activity aimed at maintaining access or privilege escalation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks to run calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges, indicating potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe. The first event says that the Image was loaded for MpOAV.dll in Windows Defender. That seems normal since Defender uses these modules. Then, there's a file created in a temporary directory with a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Powershell scripts can be malicious, especially if they're dropped into temp directories.\n\nNext, the same script is deleted. That could mean it was executed and then cleaned up to avoid detection. Then there's a pipe created in PowerShell, which might be for communication between processes or for some other legitimate task.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event where powershell.exe runs a command that creates a scheduled task. The command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. Creating a scheduled task with administrative rights could be a way to persist malicious activity, which is concerning.\n\nThere are several events from chrome.exe modifying the registry, but those seem less suspicious unless they're part of a broader attack vector, but isolated, it's hard to tell. However, more notable is that after some time, there are multiple events with \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any process or file information, which could indicate remote execution attempts.\n\nPutting this all together: powershell.exe executing arbitrary commands, creating scheduled tasks to run calc.exe, and then having several remote command executions. This pattern suggests possible malicious activity like persistence mechanisms (scheduled tasks) and potential payload execution (calc.exe is often used in attacks). The combination of these events over the batch makes it interesting as they could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities, including creating and deleting a temporary script file, registering scheduled tasks with elevated privileges to execute calc.exe, and several 'Execute a Remote Command' events. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms and potential payload execution.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there's an event where 'WmiPrvSE.exe' loads 'taskschd.dll'. WmiPrvSE.exe is a known process related to Windows Management Instrumentation, so that seems normal. Next, I notice multiple events from 'svchost.exe' setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for system services, and it's not unusual for it to interact with the registry.\n\nThen there's an event where 'svchost.exe' creates a file in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum'. The name looks suspicious—maybe Portuguese for \"common unit\" or something else. I should keep that in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe next couple of events mention executing remote commands without specifying the process, which is a bit concerning. Remote command execution can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's happening multiple times.\n\nThen there are several entries from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and can execute commands or scripts. The events show file creations in user-specific directories like 'AppData' and 'Downloads', which could indicate script execution or data storage. Creating files in these locations might be part of malicious activities, but it's also possible for legitimate scripts.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple registry writes from various processes, including 'conhost.exe' and 'chrome.exe'. Chrome interacting with the registry isn't uncommon, especially when loading extensions or plugins. However, the frequency here is high—there are several such events, which might be worth investigating if they're out of the ordinary for a user's browsing habits.\n\nThere's also an event where 'powershell.exe' creates files named 'entrada_principal.txt' and 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. The names are in Portuguese, which might suggest some regional activity or specific scripts being run. Without knowing more about what these files contain, it's hard to say, but the naming could be a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry where 'winlogbeat.exe' is creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is used for log shipping and monitoring, so this seems benign unless it's part of a larger suspicious pattern.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple remote command executions, several registry modifications by different processes (some potentially legitimate like Chrome and svchost), file creations by PowerShell in user directories, and some unusual file names. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the combination raises some red flags. The repeated use of remote commands and the activities from powershell.exe could indicate potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because there are multiple potentially suspicious activities that together suggest possible malicious intent. However, I should also consider if these could be part of normal user activity or legitimate system processes. For example, svchost and chrome's registry writes are common, but the frequency might still warrant a closer look.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the events, I think there's enough here to merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially suspicious activities including remote command executions, file creations by PowerShell in user directories with unusual names, and high frequency registry modifications. These collectively suggest possible malicious behavior.\"\n}"}
