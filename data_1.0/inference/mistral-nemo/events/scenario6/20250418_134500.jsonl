{"file":"data\/events\/scenario6\/20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the events you've provided, here's a summary of what happened:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Process Creation and Activities:**\n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was created.\n   - It loaded several DLLs (`msedgeupdate.dll`, `d3dx9_43.dll`, etc.) from its installation directory.\n   - It accessed other processes and opened network connections (可能是为了下载更新).\n   - It terminated multiple times (possibly due to normal operation or crash).\n\n2. **Registry Changes:**\n   - `RuntimeBroker.exe` set a registry value.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Process Creation and Activities:**\n   - A new instance of `winlogbeat.exe` was created from the downloaded directory.\n   - It loaded its executable and created a log file (`winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`) in its logs directory.\n\nHere are some observations:\n\n- The Microsoft Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) seems to be running and terminating multiple times, which could indicate either normal operation (if updates are being installed) or potential issues (if crashes are occurring).\n\n- Winlogbeat, a logging agent for Elastic Stack, was started manually. It created a log file where it will presumably write logs from the system.\n\nTo understand these events better, you might want to:\n\n- Check if Microsoft Edge updates were indeed being installed.\n- Verify if the multiple terminations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are normal or indicative of issues.\n- Ensure that winlogbeat is running as expected and monitor its logs for any relevant insights."}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario6\/20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a breakdown of the events and their potential implications:\n\n1. **File Created Events:**\n   - Multiple `content.phf` files were created in the DeliveryOptimization cache folder. This could indicate normal Windows operation or potentially unwanted software (PUPs) related to Delivery Optimization.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"svchost.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\ServiceProfiles\\\\NetworkService\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\DeliveryOptimization\\\\Cache\\\\0119e1000c0b37d7bf0cbfcf99429ea7a6b906fb\\\\content.phf\"}}\n     ```\n   - A temporary file `setup.exe` was created in the Microsoft Edge update folder, which is normal during software updates.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft\\\\EdgeUpdate\\\\Install\\\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\\\setup.exe\"}}\n     ```\n\n2. **File Delete Event:**\n   - A Microsoft Edge update executable was deleted from the temporary folder, which is normal during software installation.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"}}\n     ```\n\n3. **Process Create Events:**\n   - Notepad was launched from the command line, which is normal user activity.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"notepad.exe\",\"command_line\":\"\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\notepad.exe\\\" \"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\"file\":null}\n     ```\n\n4. **Registry Event:**\n   - A registry value was set, which could indicate normal system activity or potentially software installation\/configuration.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"Explorer.EXE\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":null}\n     ```\n\n5. **Dns Query Event:**\n   - A DNS query was made by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is normal Windows behavior related to compatibility telemetry.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"CompatTelRunner.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\"},\"file\":null}\n     ```\n\n6. **Pipe Created Event:**\n   - A pipe was created, which could indicate communication between processes or software components.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"setup.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\"},\"file\":null}\n     ```\n\n7. **Winlogbeat Event:**\n   - Winlogbeat, a logging agent for the Elastic Stack, created a configuration file. This is normal if you're using Elasticsearch for logs.\n     ```\n     {\"process\":{\"name\":\"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\"}}\n     ```\n\nOverall, most of these events appear to be normal Windows operations or expected behaviors related to software updates and user activity. However, it's always a good idea to monitor such activities for any unusual patterns that could indicate potential security threats."}
