{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario2\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Frequent use of PowerShell, attempts to access system registry and files, potential misuse of WMIC.exe with loading of potentially malicious DLLs.\"\n}\n``` \n\n\nLet me break down why this batch is flagged as interesting:\n\n* **PowerShell Activity:**  Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being used suggests scripting activity which can be both legitimate and malicious.\n* **Registry Access:** Frequent registry value set operations (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wmiprvse.exe`) indicate a process attempting to modify system settings, potentially for hiding or persistence.\n* **File Creation:**  Creation of new files like \"objeto_temporario.txt\" and the winlogbeat configuration file raises suspicion. This could be used for storing malicious data or configuring tools.\n* **WMIC.exe Behavior:** `WMIC.exe` loading system DLLs (`amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`)  can be legitimate, but it's unusual to see this many instances. \n\n**Important Note:** This analysis alone isn't definitive proof of malicious activity. Further investigation is needed to determine the context and intent behind these actions. Looking at timestamps, file contents, network connections, and user accounts associated with these events would provide a more complete picture."}
