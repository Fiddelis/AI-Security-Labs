PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its scripting capabilities.\n\n* **AMSI Loading:** `WMIC.exe` loading `amsi.dll` raises suspicion. AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) is a security feature that intercepts scripts for scanning. Attackers sometimes try to disable or bypass AMSI.\n\n**Important Note:** While these events are suspicious, they don't definitively prove malicious activity. Further investigation, including examining the content of PowerShell executions and registry changes, would be needed to confirm."}
