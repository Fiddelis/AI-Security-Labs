This is a classic pattern for malware or malicious scripts.\n* **Suspicious Network Activity:** The commands use `Invoke-WebRequest` to send POST requests to an external domain, potentially exfiltrating data or interacting with a command-and-control (C2) server.\n* **File System Access:** Logs indicate file creation and registry modification events associated with PowerShell executions. This suggests attempts to establish persistence or gather information about the system.\n\nWhile `chrome.exe` activity is present, it's not unusual and doesn't inherently point to malicious behavior. The focus should be on the suspicious PowerShell activities which warrant a deeper investigation."}
