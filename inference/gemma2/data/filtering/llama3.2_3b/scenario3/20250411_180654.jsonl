This strongly suggests keylogging activity, as \"Get-Keystrokes\" is a common name for malicious scripts designed to capture typed information.\n* **File Creation in Temporary Locations:**  Events log the creation of files in temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`). Malicious actors often use these locations to store stolen data or execute further actions without leaving persistent traces.\n\n**Important Note:** While this batch raises serious concerns, it's crucial to investigate further.  More in-depth analysis of the script contents and system behavior is needed for a definitive conclusion about malicious intent. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other JSONL logs you'd like me to analyze!"}
