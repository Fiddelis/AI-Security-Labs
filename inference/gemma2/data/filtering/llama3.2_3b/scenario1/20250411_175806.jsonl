This key is frequently targeted by malware to execute malicious code automatically when a user logs in.\n\n* **Persistence Attempt:** Creating entries in the \"Run\" key allows malware to persist on a system even after restarts. \n\n* **Command-Line Activity:** The `cmd.exe` command used to add a registry value (\"registro_auxiliar\") and the `reg.exe` commands used for creating entries (\"entrada_principal\") are further indicators of potential malicious activity. \n\n\nThis combination of events strongly suggests that there might be an ongoing attempt to install or execute malware on the system."}
