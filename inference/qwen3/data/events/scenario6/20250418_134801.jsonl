{"file":"data\/events\/scenario6\/20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of log events. The user wants me to determine if this is relevant for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries. There's MicrosoftEdge.exe creating a file named setup.exe in a temporary directory. Then, the file creation time is changed. That might be normal, but sometimes malware uses temporary files to stage payloads. The path seems related to Edge updates, but maybe it's a legitimate process. However, the setup.exe being created could be a red flag if it's not part of a known update.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. MpOAV.dll is also a Microsoft file, so maybe that's okay. But sometimes attackers might load these to bypass protections. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but could also be part of a C2 channel. The file path is null here, so maybe it's a process without a file context.\n\nServices.exe logs a logon, and then there are several special logon events. These might be normal system events, but multiple special logons could indicate something. However, the user has a lot of User Account Management events, which might be benign, like user logins or changes.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell command in the event with the command line. It's checking for .inf files and looking for specific sections. That seems like it could be a script to check for certain registry entries, maybe part of a system check. But the command is a bit complex. Maybe it's a legitimate script, but the presence of PowerShell commands could be a sign of something else.\n\nAnother event has PowerShell creating a file in the system profile directory. That might be part of a user profile setup, but again, could be malicious. The file path is specific, but not sure.\n\nThere's a DNS query from chrome.exe, which is normal. Winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the downloads directory seems like a legitimate application, but the path is user-specific. The svchost.exe registry value sets are common for system services, so probably normal.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal, as urlmon.dll is used for URL handling. The last event is svchost.exe creating a service, which is standard.\n\nPutting it all together, there are a few suspicious elements: the creation of setup.exe in a temporary directory, the PowerShell command checking for .inf files, and the multiple User Account Management events. However, some of these could be legitimate. The key is whether there's a pattern indicating malicious activity. The setup.exe and the PowerShell script might be part of a larger attack, but without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple events that could be part of a multi-stage attack might make this relevant for investigation. However, some of the events are normal system activity, so it's a mix. I need to check if there's a clear threat indicator. The setup.exe could be a downloader, and the PowerShell script might be checking for certain conditions. The User Account Management events might be part of a privilege escalation attempt. Given that, I think this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log events contain several **suspicious behaviors** that warrant further investigation, though some activities may be **legitimate system processes**. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - **`setup.exe`** created in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) associated with Microsoft Edge updates. While legitimate updates may use such paths, **unexpected file creation** in temporary directories can indicate **malware staging** or **downloader activity**.\n   - **`winlogbeat.yml.new`** created by `winlogbeat.exe` in a user's download directory. While this could be a legitimate configuration file, **unexpected file creation** by a third-party tool may raise red flags.\n\n2. **PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - A PowerShell command checks for `.inf` files with specific sections (e.g., `LocalService`), which could be part of **system configuration checks**. However, **PowerShell scripts** are often used by attackers to execute payloads, **download malicious files**, or **modify system settings**. The complexity of the script and its focus on system files may indicate **malicious intent**.\n\n3. **Process and Pipe Activity**:\n   - **`setup.exe`** creates a **named pipe** (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) which could be used for **C2 (Command and Control)** communication or **inter-process communication (IPC)** for malicious purposes.\n\n4. **Multiple User Account Management Events**:\n   - A high volume of **User Account Management** events (e.g., logons, privilege changes) could indicate **credential dumping**, **privilege escalation**, or **user enumeration** attempts.\n\n5. **Suspicious Registry Modifications**:\n   - **`svchost.exe`** modifies registry values multiple times. While this is common for system services, **abnormal frequency or scope** could indicate **malware persistence** or **runtime modification** of system settings.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Normal System Processes**: \n  - `CompatTelRunner.exe` (Windows Update) loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Microsoft Defender components).\n  - `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` (used for URL handling).\n  - `chrome.exe` performing a DNS query.\n- **Standard System Services**: \n  - `svchost.exe` managing services like `BthAvctpSvc` (Bluetooth audio service).\n  - `winlogbeat.exe` creating log files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch **could indicate a multi-stage attack**:\n- **Initial compromise**: Malicious file creation (`setup.exe`) or PowerShell scripting.\n- **Persistence**: Registry modifications or pipe creation for C2.\n- **Privilege escalation**: User account management events.\n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Investigate the **`setup.exe`** and **PowerShell script** for malicious payloads.\n- Check for **unusual network activity** (e.g., C2 traffic via the pipe).\n- Analyze **registry changes** made by `svchost.exe`.\n- Correlate with **user behavior** to determine if the activity aligns with legitimate system operations.\n\n**Risk Level**: **Medium to High** (due to potential for malware persistence, C2, or privilege escalation)."}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario6\/20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a log event. My job is to look at all of them together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to see what's happening. The first event is about chrome.exe setting a registry value. Then there's MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's part of Windows Defender, maybe? Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the downloads folder. Hmm, that's a log shipper, so maybe legitimate. \n\nCompatTelRunner.exe is loading the same dll as before. Then svchost.exe creating some files in the DeliveryOptimization folder. That's a system service, so maybe normal. MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file for an update. Then MpCmdRun.exe loading various DLLs related to Windows Defender. There's also a file delete event for a Microsoft Edge update file, which might be part of a cleanup.\n\nAnother MpCmdRun event creating a lock file in Temp. Conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Then git.exe creating several files in a node_modules directory. That seems like a normal Git operation, maybe during a package install.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. The majority of events are related to legitimate processes like Windows Defender (MpCmdRun, MsMpEng), system services (svchost, CompatTelRunner), and tools like git and winlogbeat. The file creations and image loads seem to be part of normal operations. However, there's a mix of events. The git.exe events might be part of a development environment, which is normal. \n\nBut wait, are there any suspicious activities? The file creations by git.exe are in a specific directory, which could be normal. The MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is downloading an update, which is standard. The svchost.exe creating files in DeliveryOptimization might be part of Windows' update or data transfer. The MpCmdRun.exe is part of Windows Defender, so those image loads and file operations are expected.\n\nHowever, sometimes malicious software might mimic legitimate processes. But in this case, all the processes mentioned are either part of the OS, legitimate tools, or known services. The file paths are also within standard directories. There's no indication of unusual behavior like unauthorized access, unexpected network activity, or modification of critical system files. \n\nI don't see any events that stand out as malicious. The combination of events seems to be part of normal system operations, including updates, logging, and development activities. Therefore, this batch of events is likely not indicative of a security threat. So, the answer would be that it's not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log events primarily involve legitimate system processes and tools, such as **Windows Defender components (MpCmdRun.exe, MsMpEng)**, **system services (svchost.exe, CompatTelRunner.exe)**, and **development tools (git.exe, winlogbeat.exe)**. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Normal System Operations**:  \n   - File creations and registry modifications by `svchost.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and `conhost.exe` align with standard Windows service behavior (e.g., updates, logging).  \n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MpCmdRun.exe` are associated with legitimate software updates and security tools.  \n\n2. **Development Activity**:  \n   - `git.exe` is creating files in a `node_modules` directory, which is typical for npm package installations or development workflows.  \n\n3. **No Suspicious Indicators**:  \n   - No unusual file paths, unauthorized access attempts, or unexpected process behaviors are present.  \n   - All processes and file operations are consistent with standard system or user activity.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The events do not indicate malicious activity or security threats. They represent **normal system, software update, and development operations**.  \n\n**Answer**: Not interesting for investigation (legitimate system and development activity)."}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario6\/20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON logs where each entry is about a file being created. All of them have the process name as git.exe, and the files are in a specific path related to node_modules\/semver\/functions. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on here. The semver module is a known npm package for semantic versioning. The functions listed here like compare, gt, lt, etc., are part of that module. So, these files are likely part of a normal npm installation or a project that uses semver.\n\nBut wait, the process is git.exe. Git is used for version control, so maybe someone is cloning a repository that includes these files. However, the files are being created, which could be part of a build process or installation. But why would git.exe be creating these files? Typically, git would handle the repository, but the actual file creation might be from a package manager like npm or yarn.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're in a user's downloads folder, specifically in a directory named S206 - Qualidade de Software. That sounds like a course or project name, possibly from a university or educational institution. The user might be working on a software quality project and installed dependencies, leading to these files being created.\n\nNow, considering security angles: if these files are part of a legitimate npm install, they're not malicious. However, if git.exe is being used to execute something that creates these files, maybe there's a red flag. But the files themselves are part of a known package. Also, all events are file creations, which is normal during setup.\n\nBut wait, could this be a sign of a malicious activity? For example, if an attacker is using git to exfiltrate data or create files. However, the files are all part of semver, which is a legitimate package. The paths don't show any suspicious activity. The user might be installing a project that requires semver, and the files are part of that installation.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that all files are created by git.exe. Normally, git doesn't create these files. It's more likely that the package manager (like npm) would create them. So, maybe the logs are misleading. If git.exe is the process, but the actual creation is done by another process, maybe there's a hook or a script that's using git to trigger something. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, given the information, the files are part of a standard npm package.

Normally, git.exe would be used for cloning repositories or managing code, not for installing Node.js packages. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is using git to clone a repository that includes these files. However, the files listed are part of the semver package, which is typically installed via npm. If the user is using git to download a project that has these files, then it's possible. But the presence of multiple files in the node_modules\\semver directory suggests that the installation is happening through npm, not git. \n\nAnother angle: if the files are being created by git.exe, that's unusual. Normally, npm install would use node.exe or the package manager's process. So, if git.exe is responsible for creating these files, that might indicate some kind of malicious activity, like a trojan that uses git.exe to download and install malicious packages. \n\nBut I should also consider the context. The user's path includes \"Downloads\\inatel\\S206...\" which might be a personal project. If the user is working on a software quality project, it's possible they're setting up a Node.js environment. However, the fact that git.exe is creating these files instead of npm or node.exe could still be suspicious. \n\nLooking at the files created: they are all part of the semver package. The semver package is a legitimate npm package, so the files themselves aren't malicious. But the method of creation (via git.exe) is the key here. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the user is using a script that runs git.exe to download the semver package, but that's not typical. Usually, you'd use npm install semver. If the files are being created by git.exe, that's an anomaly. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the batch shows git.exe creating multiple files in a node_modules directory, which is unusual.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process Involved**: All events are initiated by `git.exe`, which is typically associated with Git version control. However, Git itself does not directly create files in `node_modules`—this is usually handled by `npm` or other package managers.\n   \n2. **File Locations**: The files are created in directories under `node_modules`, which are standard for npm package installations. The paths suggest a development environment (e.g., `inatel`, `S206 - Qualidade de Software`), possibly related to a course or project.\n\n3. **File Types**: The files include typical npm package artifacts (e.g., `package.json`, `.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc`, etc.), which are benign and commonly found in Node.js projects.\n\n4. **Unusual Behavior**: The use of `git.exe` to create these files is atypical. While Git can be integrated into build processes, the direct creation of `node_modules` files by Git is not standard. This could indicate:\n   - A misconfigured script or workflow (e.g., a Git hook or custom automation).\n   - A potential security concern if the files were generated by an unauthorized process.\n\n5. **Lack of Clear Indicators of Compromise**: There is no evidence of malicious payloads, unusual permissions, or network activity. The files themselves appear legitimate and are consistent with a developer's environment.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Not Immediately Suspicious**: The files are part of standard npm packages, and the directory structure aligns with a development setup. The unusual use of `git.exe` for file creation might be a misconfiguration or a custom workflow.\n- **Recommendation**: While not a clear threat, the behavior warrants further investigation. Check for:\n  - Unusual scripts or hooks in the Git repository.\n  - Verification of the source of the `git.exe` process (e.g., whether it's a legitimate Git installation or a malicious binary).\n  - Monitoring for additional suspicious activity (e.g., unauthorized access, unexpected file modifications).\n\n**Final Determination**: The batch of events is **not immediately interesting** from a security perspective, but the atypical use of `git.exe` to create `node_modules` files should be examined for potential misconfigurations or hidden workflows."}

Each entry has git.exe as the process name, and the files are being created in a specific path. The paths seem to be part of a node_modules directory, specifically under sshpk. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what sshpk is. From what I remember, sshpk is a Node.js library for handling SSH keys and related operations. It's used for parsing and generating SSH public and private keys, which are essential for secure communications. The files listed here are various JavaScript files and man pages related to this library.\n\nNow, the process is git.exe. Git is a version control system, so usually, when someone uses git, they're cloning repositories, making changes, committing, etc. But why would git.exe be creating these files? Well, if someone is cloning a repository that includes the sshpk package, then git might be downloading and extracting the node_modules, which includes sshpk. So the files being created are part of a normal npm install process, perhaps.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this batch of events is relevant for investigation. So I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here. The files are all part of a legitimate npm package, so creating them via git might be part of a normal development setup. However, sometimes malicious actors might use git to download and execute code, but in this case, the files are part of a known library. \n\nAnother angle: the files are being created by git.exe. Could this be a red herring? Maybe someone is using git to download a malicious package that's named similarly to sshpk? But the paths are specific to sshpk, which is a legitimate npm package. Unless there's a known exploit or malicious usage of sshpk, which I'm not aware of, these files seem benign.\n\nAlso, the fact that all the files are in the same directory structure under node_modules suggests they're part of a project's dependencies. So the user might be setting up a development environment, and these files are just part of that process. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any unusual pattern. All the events are file creations, and they're all from git.exe. If there's a single process creating a lot of files in a short time, that could be a sign of something. But in this case, the files are part of a package installation, which is a normal activity. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the user is using git to clone a repository that includes these files, and the system is logging the file creation events. Since the files are part of a legitimate package, there's no indication of malicious intent here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch of events seems to be related to a normal development activity involving the sshpk library.

Could this be a red herring? Maybe the user is cloning a repository, and the files are part of the project. However, the presence of multiple node_modules subdirectories (like strip-json-comments, supports-color, tcomb-validation, tcomb) might indicate that the user is installing npm packages, which is normal. \n\nBut why are these files being created through git.exe?

So the process is git.exe, but the action is creating files. That's unusual. Normally, git.exe would be used for Git commands, not for creating files.

Since all the events are related to git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which is unusual, it's worth investigating.

But without more context, the fact that git.exe is creating these files could be a sign of something else. \n\nI think the classification should be INTERESTING because the process (git.exe) is creating files in a directory that's typically managed by npm, which is not standard. This could indicate a potential security issue, so it's worth further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show multiple file creation events triggered by `git.exe`, all occurring within `node_modules` directories. While `node_modules` is common in Node.js projects, the use of `git.exe` (typically associated with Git version control) to create these files is unusual. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process**: `git.exe` is not typically involved in file creation. It is usually used for Git operations like commits, pushes, or pulls.\n2. **Files**: The files (`index.js`, `package.json`, `license`, etc.) are standard for npm packages, suggesting normal development activity.\n3. **Context**: The paths include project-specific names like `inatel` and `S206 - Qualidade de Software`, which might indicate a university or internal project, but this alone does not confirm malicious intent.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- **Unusual Behavior**: The use of `git.exe` to create files in `node_modules` is atypical. This could indicate:\n  - A malicious actor using Git to exfiltrate data or deploy payloads.\n  - A misconfigured script or tool that leverages Git for unintended file creation.\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional information (e.g., user activity, system logs, or network traffic), the exact intent remains unclear.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**INTERESTING**  \nWhile the files themselves appear benign, the unusual combination of `git.exe` and file creation in `node_modules` warrants further investigation. This could signal a potential security threat, such as a malicious process masquerading as Git activity, or a misconfigured tool. Security teams should verify the legitimacy of the process and check for signs of compromise."}

However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother angle: the files are all in a single directory, which might be a sign of a script or tool that's generating these files. If these files are part of a legitimate project, then it's normal. But if they're being created without the user's knowledge, that's a problem. \n\nConsidering the lack of other suspicious activities (like network connections, registry changes, etc.), and the fact that the files are part of known npm packages, it's possible that this is a benign activity. However, the use of git.exe to create these files is unusual. \n\nBut maybe the user is using Git in a way that's part of their development workflow. For example, maybe they're cloning a repository that includes these files, and Git is creating them as part of the clone. However, the presence of node_modules suggests that these are dependencies, which are usually installed via npm, not cloned by Git. \n\nAlternatively, the user might be running a script that uses Git to generate these files, which could be a red flag. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nIn the absence of other suspicious indicators, the main thing is that git.exe is creating files in a node_modules directory. This could be a sign of a malicious process, but it could also be a benign setup. However, since the question is about whether it's interesting for investigation, the answer would be that it's worth looking into because the process is unusual for creating such files. The files themselves are legitimate, but the method of creation is suspicious. Therefore, the answer is that this is interesting and should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows multiple file creations in a `node_modules` directory, all initiated by `git.exe`. While the files (e.g., `.d.ts`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`) are typical of npm package dependencies, the **use of `git.exe` to create these files is highly unusual**. Legitimate npm installations or package management tools (like `npm` or `yarn`) handle dependency installation, not `git.exe`. This could indicate:\n\n1. **Malicious Activity**: A malicious process might be masquerading as `git.exe` to generate or deploy files in a node_modules directory, potentially for code injection or persistence.\n2. **Unusual Workflow**: The user might be using `git.exe` in a non-standard way (e.g., a custom script or CI\/CD pipeline), but this is rare and warrants scrutiny.\n3. **False Positive**: If the user is manually cloning a repository that includes these files, `git.exe` might be creating them as part of the clone. However, `node_modules` typically contains installed dependencies, not source code.\n\n### Key Red Flags:\n- **Process Mismatch**: `git.exe` is not typically responsible for creating files in `node_modules`.\n- **Lack of Context**: No additional indicators (e.g., network activity, registry changes) are provided to confirm legitimacy.\n- **Unusual File Locations**: The files are in a user-specific directory (`Downloads`) rather than a project root, which is uncommon for npm dependencies.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThis activity is **interesting for investigation**. Further analysis should include:\n- Checking if `git.exe` is part of a legitimate workflow (e.g., a custom script).\n- Scanning the system for malware or unauthorized processes.\n- Verifying if the files are part of a known, benign npm package or if they were generated by an unknown source.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThis is **interesting** and warrants further investigation due to the unusual use of `git.exe` to create files in a `node_modules` directory. The files themselves are benign, but the method of creation raises red flags."}

Normally, git.exe would handle repository operations, not create files.

{"file":"data\/events\/scenario6\/20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. All of them are file creations triggered by git.exe. The files are in a node_modules directory under a user's downloads folder. The paths mention things like undici-types and universalify, which are npm packages. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal activity. Git is often used for version control, and when someone clones a repository, it might install node modules. But the user's path includes \"inatel\" and \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which might be a course or project name. So maybe the user is working on a software project and installed dependencies.\n\nBut wait, the files being created are TypeScript files (.d.ts) and some JavaScript files. These are part of type definitions and modules. The fact that git.exe is creating these files could be part of a normal npm install process. However, git.exe is usually for Git operations, not for installing Node packages. Typically, npm install would handle those files. So maybe the user is using Git to clone a repository that includes these modules, and then the installation process is creating the files. But why would git.exe be creating these files? That's a bit odd. Maybe the user is running a script that uses git to download something and then creates these files, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, could this be a sign of malicious activity? Malware sometimes creates files in unusual locations or uses processes to spread. However, the files here seem to be legitimate npm packages. The paths are within a user's Downloads directory, which is a common place for such installations. Also, the files are part of known packages like undici-types and universalify, which are legitimate npm modules.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple .d.ts files suggests TypeScript type definitions, which are common in projects using TypeScript. The user might be setting up a development environment, and the files are part of that setup. Since all events are related to file creation by git.exe, and the files are in a project directory, it's more likely a benign activity rather than a security threat. However, I should check if git.exe is being used in an unusual way. For example, if the user is using git to clone a repo that includes these modules, but the installation process is handled by npm, not git. So maybe the git.exe is part of the normal workflow, like cloning a repo that has a package.json, leading to npm install which creates the node_modules. But the logs show git.exe creating the files, not npm. That's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is using a tool that combines git and npm, or maybe the files are being generated by some script run via git. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the files are part of known packages and the paths are in a user's project directory, it's more likely a legitimate setup. Therefore, the batch of events is probably not interesting from a security standpoint.

The files include TypeScript type definition files (`.d.ts`) and npm package files (e.g., `universalify`, `undici-types`). Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Contextual Normalcy**:\n   - The files are part of standard npm package structures (e.g., `universalify`, `undici-types`), which are legitimate TypeScript and utility libraries.\n   - The directory path (`inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software`) suggests a project or course-related context, aligning with typical development workflows.\n\n2. **Process Behavior**:\n   - `git.exe` is typically used for version control (e.g., cloning repositories), not for installing npm packages. However, it is possible that the user is:\n     - Cloning a repository containing a `package.json` and running `npm install` (which would create `node_modules`), but the logs explicitly show `git.exe` creating files, which is unusual.\n     - Using a custom script or tool that leverages `git.exe` to generate or manage project files.\n\n3. **Security Considerations**:\n   - **Benign Activity**: The files are legitimate npm packages, and the directory structure is typical for development environments.\n   - **Unusual Behavior**: The use of `git.exe` to create `node_modules` files is non-standard. This could indicate:\n     - A misconfigured script or tool.\n     - A potential red herring (e.g., malware masquerading as legitimate activity), though no malicious indicators (e.g., obfuscation, unusual file locations) are present.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity appears to be **benign** and likely part of a normal development process. The files are legitimate npm packages, and the directory structure aligns with typical project setups. While the use of `git.exe` to create `node_modules` files is unusual, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent. \n\n**Classification**: `NOT INTERESTING`  \n**Reason**: The logs reflect standard npm package installation or project setup activities, with no signs of malicious behavior."}

Normally, git is used for version control, but it's unusual for it to create files in a node_modules directory. Node modules are typically installed via npm or yarn, not through Git. So, maybe someone is using Git to clone a repository that includes these files, but the presence of multiple files in node_modules might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all belong to the same directory: S206 - Qualidade de Software. This could be a project folder. The files created are part of the node_modules, which usually contain third-party libraries.
