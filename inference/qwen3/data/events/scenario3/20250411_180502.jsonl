{"file":"data\/events\/scenario3\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The answer should be a JSON object with \"CLASSIFICATION\" as either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING and a \"JUSTIFICATION\" explaining why.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events to spot any patterns or suspicious activities. Let's start by breaking down the events. \n\nThe first few events involve chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But there are multiple network connections from chrome.exe, which might be part of regular activity, but could also indicate something else.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe events. The first one is a registry value set. Then there's a process create event with a command line that starts a batch file. The command line seems a bit long and has paths like \"C:\\\\pacote_comum\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". The use of .. in the path might be a red flag, possibly indicating directory traversal. \n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs. Some of these are legitimate system files, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of .NET. But the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be normal for PowerShell running scripts. However, the file created in Temp is named with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then, that file is deleted, which could be an attempt to clean up after executing a script. \n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which might be part of inter-process communication. Then, several Provider Lifecycle events with command lines that start different batch files. The paths here seem to be using a lot of .. and different directories, which could be an attempt to access specific files or directories. \n\nLooking at the command lines, they all start with powershell.exe & {Start-Process \"...\"}. The paths in the command lines are a bit complex, with multiple .. which might be trying to navigate to a specific location. The names of the batch files are generic, like \"modulo_logico_script.bat\" or \"unidade_principal_script.bat\", which might be obfuscated. \n\nThe combination of multiple process creations, registry changes, file creation and deletion, and network connections from chrome.exe could indicate a potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to execute batch files, especially with complex paths, might be part of a script that's trying to perform some system changes or exfiltrate data. The fact that the script is created in the Temp directory and then deleted suggests an attempt to avoid detection. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these activities could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the sheer number of events and the specific paths used might be suspicious. The presence of multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events could indicate that something is trying to manage processes or services, which is unusual. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the events span different processes, including ApplicationFrameHost.exe, which is part of Windows, but the registry changes from that process might be part of a larger attack. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell commands, file operations, network activity, and registry changes could be indicative of malicious activity. The complex paths and the use of Temp files for scripts might be tactics to evade detection. Therefore, the batch of events is likely relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event stream shows suspicious PowerShell activity with complex file paths, registry modifications, and network connections. Multiple process creations, script execution attempts, and file deletions in temporary directories suggest potential malicious behavior, such as script-based exploitation or data exfiltration. The use of '..' in paths and obfuscated batch file names indicates possible evasion tactics.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario3\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event and note any suspicious activities. The first event is Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, maybe. Then there's powershell.exe doing registry changes. PowerShell can be benign, but multiple registry modifications might be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's a process accessing another process (ProcessAccess) which could be part of normal operations, but combined with other events... Then there's an image loaded from a path related to Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe not malicious. But then there's a command line with powershell.exe running a batch file from a path that seems a bit odd, like \"estrutura_logico\" and \"entrada_comum\". Those aren't standard Windows directories, which might indicate something's off.\n\nChrome.exe is creating multiple registry entries. While Chrome does modify some registry keys, the sheer number might be suspicious. Also, there's a process creating a file in the user's AppData directory, which could be a malware dropping itself. Another event shows a file created by svchost.exe in a DeliveryOptimization folder, which is a legitimate system process, but the file path seems normal.\n\nWait, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder named \"componente_principal.txt\". That's a bit strange because the name is generic, but the path is user-specific. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the combination of multiple registry changes, PowerShell executing scripts from non-standard paths, and file creations in unusual locations could indicate a potential compromise. \n\nAlso, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for both legitimate and possibly malicious DLLs might be part of a persistence mechanism or malware activity. The fact that several processes are accessing each other's memory or creating files in unexpected places raises flags. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch has multiple suspicious activities that could be indicative of a security incident. The combination of registry modifications, unusual file paths, and PowerShell script executions suggests that this batch is relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell, suspicious file paths (e.g., 'estrutura_logico'), PowerShell executing scripts from non-standard locations, and unusual file creations in user directories suggest potential malicious activity or compromise.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario3\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user provided a batch of JSONL entries, and I need to analyze them as a whole. \n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from chrome.exe setting registry values. The same process is mentioned multiple times, eight times in total. The task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" each time. That's repetitive. But I should check if there's any pattern or if it's just normal activity.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in a specific path. The file path is in a downloads directory, which might be normal, but the filename includes .winlogbeat.yml.new. That could be related to a configuration file. But since it's a file creation, maybe it's part of an installation or update process.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe event creating a file named elemento_base.txt. The name seems odd. Maybe it's a script or a configuration file. However, PowerShell is often used in both legitimate and malicious contexts. The file name doesn't immediately ring a bell, but the combination with the registry changes might be suspicious.\n\nWait, the chrome.exe events are all the same. If the same process is modifying the registry multiple times, that could be normal if it's part of an application's setup. But if it's doing something unusual, like setting keys that shouldn't be modified, that's a red flag. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe file creations are from different processes. The winlogbeat.exe is a known tool for log shipping, so creating a config file might be normal. But the elemento_base.txt could be a script or a malicious file. However, the user's environment is a Windows machine, and these files are in the Downloads directory, which is a common place for temporary files. \n\nBut the key point here is the combination. If multiple registry changes are happening, especially by chrome.exe, and then some file creations, maybe there's a coordinated attack. For example, maybe the registry changes are to disable security features, and the file creations are to deploy malware or scripts. \n\nHowever, I need to be cautious. The same process (chrome.exe) is doing the registry changes repeatedly. If that's part of a normal operation, like updating settings, it's not interesting. But if it's an unusual activity, like modifying critical registry keys, it's a sign of something malicious. \n\nThe presence of both registry changes and file creations could indicate a multi-step attack. The justification would need to mention the combination of these events. Since the user is asking to consider the entire batch, the repetition of chrome.exe registry changes and the file creations might be part of a larger malicious activity. \n\nTherefore, the classification should be INTERESTING because the combination of multiple registry modifications by a common process and file creations could indicate a potential security incident. The justification should explain that the repeated registry changes and file creations might be part of a coordinated attack or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe combined with file creation events (including PowerShell activity) suggest potential coordinated behavior that could indicate malicious configuration changes or script deployment.\"\n}"}
