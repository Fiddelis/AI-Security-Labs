The answer should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events to spot any suspicious activity. Let me start by scanning each entry.\n\nThe first event is about 'whoami.exe' being created. That's a legitimate command-line tool, so probably not malicious. Then there's multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used in both legitimate and malicious contexts, so I need to check what it's doing.\n\nLooking at the command line of one of the PowerShell processes: it's using 'findstr' to search for 'pass' in various file types and then using 'select-string' with a password pattern. That seems like it's trying to find passwords in files, which could be part of a credential harvesting attempt. That's a red flag.\n\nThere are multiple events where PowerShell is accessing the registry, setting values, and loading images. The fact that it's loading DLLs from different paths might be normal, but combined with the file search for passwords, it's suspicious. Also, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory, which could be part of a script that's being run temporarily. The file name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which might be a sign of a script that's checking for policies, but the context here is unclear.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might be related to the PowerShell process managing modules or providers, but again, combined with the password search, it's concerning.\n\nThere's also a mention of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file, which is a log shipper tool. That's probably legitimate. Then there's 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' which are normal applications, but the 'svchost.exe' modifying the registry might be part of normal system operations or something else.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious points are the PowerShell processes executing commands to search for passwords in various files, modifying registry values, and loading multiple DLLs. The combination of these actions suggests a potential credential harvesting or data exfiltration attempt. Even though some actions are normal, the specific commands and the sequence of events raise concerns about malicious activity. Therefore, the batch is relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute suspicious commands searching for passwords in files, modify registry values, and load unusual DLLs, indicating potential credential harvesting or malicious activity.\"\n}"}

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to look at all of them together and decide if they're relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning through the events. The first one is about svchost.exe setting a registry value. Then there's findstr.exe being created with a command line that looks for \"pass\" in various file types. That might be a sign of searching for sensitive info. Next, there's a PowerShell command that uses findstr and select-string with a password pattern. That seems suspicious because it's searching for passwords in files. \n\nThen there's a PowerShell process creating a file in a user's AppData directory. Maybe that's storing some data? Another event shows PowerShell setting a registry value. Then there are multiple instances of Chrome.exe setting registry values and making DNS queries. Also, Chrome is loading some DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scanning Interface. If Chrome is loading that, maybe it's related to malware evading detection. \n\nAlso, there's a NetworkConnect event from Chrome, which could indicate outbound connections to something. The PowerShell process creates a file named objeto_logico.txt, which might be a log file or something else. \n\nPutting this together, the presence of multiple registry changes, searching for passwords, PowerShell activities, and network connections could indicate malicious behavior. The use of findstr and PowerShell to search for passwords in various files is a red flag. Also, the loading of specific DLLs and network connections might be part of an attack. Even though some events are normal (like Chrome running), the combination of these actions suggests potential malicious activity. So, the classification should be INTERESTING because there's a pattern of suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications, PowerShell processes searching for password patterns in files, suspicious file creations, and Chrome processes with unusual DLL loads and network connections, indicating potential malicious activity.\"\n}"}

The answer should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to see what's happening. The first few entries are about chrome.exe setting registry values. That's repetitive, but maybe not too concerning on its own. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be normal if it's part of the system. Then PowerShell is creating a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. That could be benign, but maybe not. \n\nNext, there's a process access by PowerShell, which might be normal, but combined with other actions... Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is a common command to check user privileges. Then cmd.exe is deleting scheduled tasks, which could be a sign of someone trying to remove existing tasks. The schtasks.exe process is being used to delete tasks, which might be part of cleaning up or removing scheduled tasks. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe with a command to delete tasks with specific names. The schtasks.exe is also being used to delete tasks, which could be part of a script to remove scheduled tasks. Then there's WMIC.exe trying to delete notepad.exe processes. That's suspicious because WMIC is often used in malware for system management. The image loads for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, which are system files, but the use of WMIC to delete processes might indicate an attempt to terminate processes, possibly to hide malicious activity.\n\nPutting this together, there are multiple actions involving deleting scheduled tasks, using PowerShell and cmd.exe with specific commands, and WMIC being used to delete processes. These could be signs of a malicious actor trying to remove traces of their activity or modify system configurations. The combination of these events, especially the use of WMIC to delete processes and the deletion of scheduled tasks, might indicate a potential security incident.

The user wants me to determine if this is relevant for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process named WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That might be normal, but I should check the rest. Then there are multiple entries with PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe doing registry changes and process accesses. \n\nWait, some of the commands involve deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"componente_comum_Admin\". Deleting user accounts could be a sign of removing administrative accounts, maybe to hide the attacker's presence. Also, the use of net1.exe, which isn't a standard Windows tool, might be suspicious. \n\nThe events show repeated registry modifications and process accesses, which could indicate an attacker trying to maintain access or clear logs. The presence of both PowerShell and cmd.exe with commands to delete users suggests coordinated efforts. \n\nEven though some actions might be legitimate, the combination of deleting multiple user accounts and using non-standard executables like net1.exe raises red flags.

{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is relevant for investigation. Let me start by analyzing each event and then see how they connect.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. The command_line fields in some entries mention things like deleting files or running 'sc delete win32times'. That might be suspicious because deleting services could be part of malware cleanup. Also, the use of cmd.exe with '\/c sc delete' suggests trying to remove a service, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events. Malware often modifies registry keys to persist or change system behavior. The fact that multiple processes like services.exe, conhost.exe, and cmd.exe are interacting with the registry could indicate attempts to establish persistence or alter system settings.\n\nLooking at the file deletions, there's a specific path mentioned: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe'. Deleting temporary files might be part of cleaning up after a malicious operation, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with powershell.exe might indicate some kind of process management or maybe a script that's being executed multiple times. The presence of 'Image loaded' events for DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll could be normal, but if they're loaded in an unusual context, that might be a problem.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of registry modifications, service deletion, file deletions, and multiple process creations. These actions are commonly associated with malware activities such as persistence, cleanup, or execution of malicious payloads. Even though some actions might be benign, the combination and frequency of these events raise suspicion. The presence of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with suspicious command lines further supports that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious registry modifications, service deletion attempts (sc delete win32times), file deletions from temporary directories, and multiple process creations involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe with potentially malicious command lines.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The answer should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING with a justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to see what's happening. The majority of the events involve PowerShell.exe. There are several ImageLoad events, which might be normal since PowerShell often loads DLLs. But then there's a FileDelete event for a temporary script file, which could be suspicious. Also, there's a FileCreate event for a PowerShell startup profile, which might be part of normal operations, but combined with other actions, it could indicate something else.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell, which might be trying to access other processes. The repeated creation of whoami.exe processes could be a red flag, especially if they're being used to check permissions or escalate privileges. The RegistryEvent entries might be modifying settings, which could be part of malware activities.\n\nHowever, some of these actions could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is often used for scripting and automation, and the registry changes might be part of normal system operations. But the combination of file deletions, process accesses, and repeated use of whoami.exe might indicate an attacker trying to move laterally or persist in the system. The presence of multiple suspicious activities across different rules (ImageLoad, FileDelete, ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent) suggests a potential malicious campaign. \n\nI should check if there's any pattern that's commonly associated with malware. The use of temporary files and the frequent process accesses could be part of a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration. Also, the fact that these events are all linked to PowerShell, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, adds to the suspicion. \n\nBut I need to be cautious not to assume without more context. However, given the combination of these events, especially the file deletions and process accesses, it's reasonable to flag this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior including loading non-standard DLLs, deleting temporary script files, accessing other processes, and modifying registry values.

{"file":"data\/filtering\/phi4-mini\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a batch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a concise justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool by Elastic for shipping logs, so creating a file might be normal. But the file path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a place where malicious files are stored. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell.exe process accessing a file. PowerShell is commonly used in both legitimate and malicious activities. The event mentions \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\", which might indicate that another process is trying to access a file, but again, without knowing the file's content, it's unclear.\n\nThen, there's whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a legitimate Windows command to check user privileges. The fact that it's being run might not be suspicious on its own. However, the command line shows it's running from the system32 directory, which is normal.\n\nAnother PowerShell.exe event with the same ProcessAccess rule. This could be part of normal operations, but if there are multiple instances or unusual behavior, it might be a red flag.\n\nThe next events involve ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe setting registry values. These are legitimate processes, but modifying registry keys could be part of malware activity. However, the keys being modified aren't specified here, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there are multiple chrome.exe events with DnsQuery and NetworkConnect rules. Chrome is a common browser, and DNS queries and network connections are normal. However, the repeated network connections might be worth looking into, especially if they're to suspicious domains. But again, without more details, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting this all together, the events seem to involve legitimate processes like winlogbeat, PowerShell, whoami, Chrome, and others. However, there are some potential red flags: the creation of a new file in the Downloads folder, multiple PowerShell accesses, registry changes, and multiple network connections. These could be signs of malicious activity, but they could also be part of normal operations. Since the user wants the entire batch considered, and there's no clear malicious intent evident from the logs alone, but some anomalies that might require further investigation, I think the classification should be INTERESTING. The justification would be that there are multiple processes with potential for malicious activity, such as file creation, registry changes, and network connections, which warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially suspicious activities: a file creation by winlogbeat.exe in a user's Downloads directory, repeated PowerShell process accesses, registry modifications by legitimate processes, and multiple network connections from Chrome. These could indicate malicious behavior or unusual system activity warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
