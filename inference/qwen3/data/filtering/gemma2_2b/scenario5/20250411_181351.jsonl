The user wants me to analyze whether this is relevant for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a concise justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first few entries mention powershell.exe being accessed or created. Then there's a whoami.exe process. The command lines for some powershell instances include code that uses System.Windows.Forms to capture the screen and save it as PNG files in the temp directory. That seems suspicious because screen capturing can be part of malware activities, like taking screenshots of the user's screen.\n\nLooking at the image loads, there are several DLLs being loaded, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the combination with the screen capture code might indicate a malicious payload. The fact that multiple processes are creating files in the temp directory with names like unidade_logico.png, tarefa_comum.png, etc., could be part of data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, the use of Add-Type to load assemblies and the specific code for copying screen content suggests that this might be a script designed to capture screenshots. The presence of multiple such events in a short time frame could indicate an ongoing attack or reconnaissance activity. The registry value set by svchost.exe might be part of modifying system settings to maintain persistence or alter behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch shows multiple suspicious activities: unusual process creations, screen capture attempts, and loading of various DLLs. These could be signs of a malware infection, possibly using PowerShell for execution. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING because the events collectively indicate potential malicious behavior that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute screen capture commands (saving screenshots to temp directory) and load suspicious DLLs, indicating potential malware activity for reconnaissance or persistence.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario5\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is relevant for investigation. Alright, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that seem to be taking screenshots. The command line uses System.Windows.Forms to capture the screen and save it as PNG files in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because taking screenshots can be part of reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The files saved are like 'estrutura_ativo.png', 'modulo_principal.png', etc. These might be used to gather information about the system or the user's activities.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. The file path is 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1'. The creation and deletion of temporary files could be part of a script execution or a way to clean up after malicious activity. The fact that it's a PowerShell script suggests it's trying to run some code, maybe to persist or execute further commands.\n\nAnother event mentions a pipe created, which could be part of inter-process communication, possibly used by malware to communicate with a command and control server. There's also an event about executing a remote command, which is a red flag. Remote execution is a common technique in attacks to take control of a system.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell processes, there's also a mention of loading an image, specifically 'MpClient.dll', which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate a malware trying to evade detection by using legitimate processes.\n\nThere are several registry value set events. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, so that's another warning sign. Also, multiple processes like ApplicationFrameHost, Calculator, and chrome.exe are involved in registry changes, which might be normal, but the combination with other suspicious activities could be concerning.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell commands doing similar actions (screen capture, file operations, registry changes) suggests a coordinated effort. The use of temporary files and the execution of remote commands points towards potential malicious intent. Even though some activities might be benign, the combination here raises red flags. The fact that the same PowerShell script is being used multiple times with different filenames might indicate an attempt to execute different payloads or to avoid detection.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch seems to be relevant for investigation. The suspicious activities include screen capture, file manipulation, remote command execution, and registry changes, which are all common in malware operations. The classification would be high risk.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event log contains multiple suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Key indicators include:\n\n1. **Screen Capture via PowerShell**: Multiple PowerShell commands use `System.Windows.Forms` to capture screenshots and save them to the Temp directory (e.g., `estrutura_ativo.png`, `modulo_principal.png`). This is often used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Temporary File Manipulation**: A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1`) is created and deleted in the Temp directory. This could indicate script execution or cleanup efforts, especially if the script is malicious.\n\n3. **Remote Command Execution**: An event explicitly mentions \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" followed by \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" and \"Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\", which may suggest remote command execution or inter-process communication (e.g., C2 channels).\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple registry value set events (e.g., via `RegistryEvent`) across processes like `powershell.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` could indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\n5. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The repeated use of PowerShell for screen capture, file operations, and registry changes, combined with the presence of a potentially malicious script, points to coordinated malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion**: This log is **highly relevant for investigation**. The combination of screen capture, temporary file manipulation, remote command execution, and registry modifications strongly suggests potential malware or adversarial activity. Further analysis of the PowerShell scripts and network traffic would be critical. \n\n**Risk Classification**: **High** (likely malicious intent)."}
{"file":"data\/filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario5\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at this batch of events. All the entries are from chrome.exe, which is a common process, so that's not immediately suspicious. The winlog tasks include registry value sets, DNS queries, and image loads. \n\nThe first thing that stands out is the repeated registry value set events. While registry changes can be normal, the frequency here might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's a pattern. \n\nThen there's an image load event for amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That's a legitimate system file, so maybe that's just chrome.exe loading it normally. But then another image load for MpOAV.dll, which is also a Microsoft Defender component. Wait, but the path here is in ProgramData, which is a common location for such files. However, if chrome.exe is loading these, maybe it's a sign of something else.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The key here is that multiple image loads from chrome.exe, especially if they're loading Defender components, could be normal. However, if the registry changes are related to modifying Defender settings or something else, that could be malicious. \n\nBut looking at the events, the registry tasks are all \"Registry value set\" but without specific keys mentioned. Without more details, it's hard to say. However, the combination of multiple image loads and registry changes from chrome.exe might be worth looking into. Maybe the chrome.exe is being used as a pivot point or there's a malicious module being loaded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just normal activity. But given that the same process is doing multiple image loads and registry changes, especially if these are in a short time frame, it could indicate a threat. The fact that the user is providing these logs as a batch suggests that the system might be under some kind of attack. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows chrome.exe performing multiple registry changes and loading system files. While some of these could be normal, the combination and repetition might indicate a potential security incident. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING because there's a potential for malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and image loads from chrome.exe, including Microsoft Defender components, could indicate potential malicious activity or unusual behavior warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
