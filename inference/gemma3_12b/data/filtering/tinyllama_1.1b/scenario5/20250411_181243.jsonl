There's also a temporary PowerShell script creation followed by immediate deletion, a common technique to evade detection. Numerous .NET framework DLLs were loaded by PowerShell, suggesting potential obfuscation or complex operations. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events for the same command line are also noteworthy.\"\n}\n```"}
