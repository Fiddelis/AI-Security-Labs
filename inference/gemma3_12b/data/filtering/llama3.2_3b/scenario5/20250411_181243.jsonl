The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1`) strongly suggests an attempt to bypass PowerShell security policies. The repeated execution of similar commands and the presence of lifecycle events for the PowerShell engine and provider further increase suspicion.\"\n}\n```"}
