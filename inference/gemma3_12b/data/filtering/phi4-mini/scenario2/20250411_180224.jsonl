The scripts are named \\\"objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\" and \\\"entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\", suggesting an attempt to evade detection. The use of 'system' account for scheduled tasks and registry modifications by `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `svchost.exe` further raise concerns. While Chrome registry modifications and Winlogbeat activity are present, the scheduled task creation and bypassed execution policy are the primary indicators of potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
