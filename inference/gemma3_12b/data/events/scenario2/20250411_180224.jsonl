This pattern strongly suggests suspicious activity, likely an attempt to execute malicious code via scheduled tasks, even if the specific scripts are currently non-existent. The use of 'system' account for task creation, coupled with the bypass of execution policy, warrants investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
