The usage of non-standard executable paths (e.g., net1.exe in C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32) is also indicative of potentially malicious behavior. Combined with activities such as security group management and user account modifications without a direct process context, this pattern suggests potential unauthorized administrative privilege escalation attempts or system manipulation.\"\n}\n```"}
