{"file":"data\/events\/scenario3\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines in some of these powershell.exe processes look suspicious. For example, one of them runs \"powershell.exe & {&\\\"C:\\\\tarefa_base\\\\tarefa_geral\\\\estrutura_secundario\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\" -LogPath $env:TEMP\\\\key.log}\". This seems like it's executing a script that might be monitoring keystrokes, which is definitely concerning because it could indicate keylogging activity—a common tactic in malware to capture sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the events more closely, I see several instances where powershell.exe accesses different files and registry keys. There are also multiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe. While chrome accessing the registry isn't unusual, the sheer number of such events (nine times) might be worth looking into. Sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to hide their activities, so it's possible that these could be part of a broader malicious campaign.\n\nAnother point is the repeated creation and access of powershell.exe processes. Malicious actors often need to keep their activities hidden and might spawn multiple instances or utilize process injection techniques. The fact that there are several 'Process Create' events for different scripts related to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 strengthens the idea that this could be part of a larger script execution meant to gather keystrokes, which is definitely malicious behavior.\n\nThe mention of mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components being loaded by powershell.exe might be part of normal operations, but when combined with the suspicious scripts and command lines, it adds another layer of concern. This could indicate that the script is using these libraries for more complex tasks, possibly related to persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nI also notice that some events don't have file paths associated with them, which might be intentional obfuscation by the attackers to avoid leaving clear traces. The variety in the command lines across different powershell.exe instances suggests a possible attempt to evade detection by varying filenames and paths each time.\n\nIn summary, while individual events like chrome modifying registry values or normal process creations aren't necessarily suspicious on their own, the combination of multiple powershell.exe processes executing scripts that seem to be for keylogging, coupled with repeated registry accesses from chrome, paints a concerning picture. This batch shows signs of potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe executing scripts potentially related to keylogging and other malicious actions, combined with unusual registry interactions from chrome.exe.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario3\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, several entries show powershell.exe being used with command lines that reference scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script is known for capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware to steal sensitive information. The fact that it's running multiple times with similar commands raises red flags—it might be attempting persistence or trying different approaches.\n\nNext, there are file creation and deletion events related to temporary PowerShell scripts. For example, the script __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 is created and then deleted. This kind of behavior is often used by malicious actors to avoid detection by cleaning up after themselves or testing if certain actions are allowed.\n\nI also notice that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Malware sometimes hooks into antivirus components to bypass detection. The multiple ImageLoad events could indicate the script is attempting to load malicious libraries or check for the presence of security tools.\n\nLooking at registry activity, there's a SetValue event in the Registry by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications are common during malicious activities, such as creating persistence points or altering system configurations to allow continued access.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new configuration file. While this could be legitimate, it's also possible that it's part of a larger campaign to log data, potentially exfiltrating information.\n\nAdditionally, svchost.exe is involved in creating files related to DeliveryOptimization. Svchost.exe is often used by malware because it's a common system process, making it harder to detect malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running suspicious scripts, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, DLL injections, registry modifications, and activity from known benign processes like winlogbeat.exe but in possibly suspicious contexts. These patterns collectively suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n\nSo, the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation because it shows several red flags indicative of possible unauthorized access, malware activities, or other security incidents.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe running suspicious scripts, file creation\/deletion patterns, and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
