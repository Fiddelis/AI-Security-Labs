{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the batch of events provided is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there's an entry from MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection. That seems normal since it's part of the antivirus service. Then, multiple chrome.exe entries show network connections and DNS queries, which are typical for browsing activity. Not suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, I see whoami.exe being executed. While this can be legitimate, it's often used by attackers to check permissions or system info. The command line doesn't seem malicious here, but the fact that it's run without arguments might raise an eyebrow, especially if there are multiple such events.\n\nThere are several powershell.exe entries with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The FileCreate event when creating tarefa_geral.txt could be writing to a file, but without knowing the content, it's hard to say. However, combining this with other suspicious activities might indicate something.\n\nCmd.exe is used in multiple places, including executing commands like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and using findstr to search for .key files. This looks like an attempt to locate key files or sensitive information on the system. The command-line arguments suggest a search for specific file types, which could be part of data exfiltration.\n\nConhost.exe is involved in some registry events, and while it's usually benign, it can sometimes be used as a backdoor by attackers. Also, RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe accessing registry values might be normal but worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe calc.exe event loading urlmon.dll seems unusual. While calc is generally harmless, executing or loading external modules could indicate tampering or malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell and cmd being used to interact with the system's registry and files, along with attempts to search for sensitive files (.key), whoami.exe runs without arguments, and an unusual calc.exe event. These collectively point towards potential malicious activities such as privilege escalation, data gathering, or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI think there's enough here that could be indicative of attacker behavior, so the batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, cmd.exe searching for .key files, and whoami.exe without arguments, which collectively suggest potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of system events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any unusual patterns or potential red flags.\n\n1. **svchost.exe** setting registry values: svchost.exe is a common system process that often runs legitimate services. However, multiple instances of it modifying the registry might be suspicious, especially if they're not part of known updates or patches.\n\n2. **Calculator.exe** loading urlmon.dll: Calculator.exe is typically benign, but loading an external DLL like urlmon could indicate some form of injection or malicious activity. I should keep this in mind.\n\n3. Another **svchost.exe** event doing the same as the first—another registry set. This repetition might be a sign of something more than just normal operation.\n\n4. **winlogbeat.exe** creating a file: Winlogbeat is an ELS (Elasticsearch Logstash Beat) tool, often used for log management. The creation of a .yml.new file seems routine unless there's an irregularity in the path or access rights.\n\n5. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe** setting registry values again—another process modifying the registry without clear justification.\n\n6. Another **Calculator.exe** with a registry set: Now I'm noticing multiple instances of Calculator and svchost making registry changes, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\n7. **powershell.exe** accessing processes and files: Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The combination of process access and other events might indicate malicious activity.\n\n8. **chrome.exe** creating a pipe and setting registry values: Chrome itself isn't malicious, but excessive registry modifications or unexpected pipes could be indicators of compromise.\n\n9. Multiple chrome.exe events with registry sets: This seems excessive. Why would Chrome need to make so many registry changes? It might be evidence of an injected script or extension doing something it shouldn't.\n\n10. Some chrome.exe events load DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate Windows components. However, if these loads are happening in an unusual context or with elevated privileges, it could raise concerns.\n\n11. Additional **powershell.exe** process accesses: This reinforces the suspicion around Powershell being used for malicious purposes, such as executing commands or accessing other processes' memory spaces.\n\n12. **whoami.exe** execution: This is a standard command-line tool to check user information. While it's innocent on its own, if executed from an unexpected location or in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of an attack vector.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple processes (svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, Powershell.exe) making registry changes and accessing each other’s process spaces stands out. Additionally, the excessive registry modifications by Chrome could indicate a potential infection or malicious activity such as installing a backdoor or persistence mechanisms.\n\nFurthermore, the use of Powershell for process access is concerning because attackers frequently abuse it due to its scripting capabilities and legitimate execution rights. The repeated activities across different processes and events suggest a coordinated sequence that might not be part of normal user behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while each individual event could seem benign at first glance, the overall pattern—especially multiple instances of registry modifications by various processes, the use of Powershell for process access, and excessive activity from Chrome—is indicative of potential malicious behavior. This batch should definitely be flagged as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications by svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe; Powershell process accesses; excessive registry events from chrome.exe; and whoami.exe execution.
