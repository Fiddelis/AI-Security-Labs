{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. While Chrome does make a lot of network requests, the frequency here seems high—five similar events in a row. That could be normal browsing activity, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe appearing several times with different tasks. The first mention is about setting a registry value, which is somewhat common but can also be part of malicious activities. Then there's a command line that stands out: it's using powershell to download files from GitHub repositories. Specifically, the URLs point to raw.githubusercontent.com and are downloading LICENSE.txt files into the TEMP directory.\n\nLooking at each event involving powershell.exe:\n\n1. The first event shows the process creation with a specific command line. It looks like it's executing some code to download files.\n2. There are multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs, which is standard when running scripts but might indicate something more if these modules aren't usually loaded.\n3. A file create event for a .ps1 script in the TEMP directory suggests that a PowerShell script was created and executed.\n4. Then, that same file is deleted, which could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nFurther down, there are several more powershell.exe events with similar command lines. Each time, it's downloading different LICENSE.txt files from various GitHub paths into TEMP. The fact that each download comes from a different repository (objeto_base, modulo_temporario, unidade_base, etc.) might indicate multiple modules or components being fetched.\n\nConsidering all these events together:\n\n- Multiple network connections and DNS queries from Chrome.\n- Powershell.exe executing several times to download files from GitHub into TEMP.\n- Temporary script creation and deletion by Powershell.\n\nThis combination raises red flags. The repeated downloading of files from different repositories, especially using a script that gets executed and then deleted, suggests potential malicious activity. It might be an attempt to download and execute scripts or payloads without leaving long-term traces on the system.\n\nI don't see any clear signs of outright malware in these logs, but the pattern—using Powershell for downloading files, creating temporary scripts, deleting them afterward—is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities. This could be part of a larger campaign or an attempt at persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n\nTherefore, this batch should be classified as interesting because it exhibits behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell.exe downloading files from various GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory, combined with file creation and deletion activities, indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of logs and trying to figure out if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Two of them have command lines that download files from GitHub repositories. That's a red flag because downloading files directly from the internet using Powershell can be a sign of malicious activity. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different branches, which seems unusual for typical script downloads. This could indicate an attempt to retrieve some payload or configuration file.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe creates files in various locations, like TEMP directories and user-specific folders. Creating files in these areas might be part of a persistence mechanism or storing malicious data. Also, there's a process accessing the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory, which could mean the script is trying to run at startup.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where chrome.exe is modifying registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, repeated writes might be suspicious. It could be an attempt to modify system configurations or hide processes.\n\nOther logs show network queries and file creations by winlogbeat.exe, which seems related to log management. However, these don't immediately seem malicious unless there's unauthorized data being sent out.\n\nOverall, the combination of downloading files via Powershell, multiple registry modifications, and file creations in unusual locations suggests potential malicious activity. This batch definitely needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple powershell.exe processes attempting to download files from GitHub repositories, which may indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze the entire batch to determine if it's relevant for investigation. The output should be just one classification—either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\"—along with a concise justification.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through each event to understand what's happening. Each line represents an event, and each event has three parts: process information, Windows log task details, and file path information.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n1. The process is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll.\n2. svchost.exe setting a registry value.\n3. Another instance of svchost.exe doing the same thing.\n4. Calculator.exe also loading urlmon.dll.\n5. More svchost.exe events with registry changes.\n\nI notice that svchost.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process, is making multiple registry changes. That could be normal, but sometimes attackers use legitimate processes for malicious activities. I should keep an eye on that.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is accessed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks, so any activity here needs careful consideration.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run with its command line showing the standard path. Whoami is usually harmless, but if it's being executed by another process or in a specific context, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nContinuing through the events:\n- cmd.exe is used to execute SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F. That looks like an attempt to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting tasks can be part of malicious activities to remove persistence mechanisms.\n- Powershell.exe accessed again.\n- Another cmd.exe deleting registry entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for \"modulo_temporario\".\n- reg.exe is used to delete another registry entry \"pacote_auxiliar\".\n\nScheduled task deletions and registry modifications, especially via cmd.exe and reg.exe, are often indicators of malicious activities trying to remove traces or disable defenses. These actions could be part of a larger attack chain, such as persistence removal or attempts to cover tracks.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated use of svchost.exe modifying the registry might indicate an attempt to create or modify service entries, which is common in malware for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Multiple instances of legitimate processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe) performing operations that are unusual or could be malicious.\n- Deletion of scheduled tasks and registry entries often used by attackers to clean up traces of their activities or remove competing software.\n- The combination suggests potential malicious activity, such as a cleanup phase after an attack.\n\nTherefore, the batch is likely interesting because it shows signs of potentially malicious behavior through these system modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving legitimate processes performing actions that may indicate malicious activity, such as deleting scheduled tasks and registry entries, suggesting potential attack or cleanup efforts.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in malicious activities. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed, which might indicate some script execution.\n\nI notice several events with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These could be normal operations if PowerShell is starting up, but the frequency here might be suspicious. Also, there are instances of file creations and deletions in temporary directories like C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. The file __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 is created and then deleted quickly, which seems like a common tactic to avoid detection by deleting traces after execution.\n\nAnother point is the registry modifications. Powershell.exe accessing or setting registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, where attackers set up their tools to run at system startup. The fact that there are multiple such events adds to the concern.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. This might mean that something is trying to persist across reboots through PowerShell's configuration.\n\nLooking at the image loads, powershell.exe is loading various .NET and Windows Defender DLLs. While this isn't inherently malicious, it could be part of obfuscation techniques or to ensure certain functionalities for malicious code execution.\n\nAdditionally, there are pipe creations which can be used for communication between processes. This might be a way for the script to talk to other running processes, possibly for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nThe last few events show that winlogbeat.exe is creating some files in its own directory, which seems normal unless it's being misused somehow. But given the focus on powershell.exe activities elsewhere, I should keep an eye out for any关联 between these processes.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of powershell.exe with file operations, registry changes, quick file deletions, and pipe creations. These behaviors are often indicative of malicious activity trying to hide its tracks or establish persistence. While some actions could be legitimate, the combination raises significant red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events including file creation\/deletion in temp directories, registry modifications, and suspicious process activity indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or used. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access could be suspicious. Also, I notice that powershell.exe is setting registry values several times. That might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, which can be part of malicious activities.\n\nThere are also instances where whoami.exe and cmd.exe are being executed. Whoami can reveal user information, and cmd.exe with certain command lines could be used for executing other commands or scripts. The command line for cmd.exe here is \"\/c\", which usually runs a command and then exits, potentially to execute malicious scripts.\n\nAnother point is the creation of temporary files by powershell.exe. Specifically, there's a file created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a random-looking name, and then it's deleted shortly after. This behavior can be an indicator of script execution or testing for permissions, which might be malicious.\n\nLooking at the image loads within powershell.exe, they're loading various DLLs, some from Microsoft.NET and others like mscoree.dll. While these are legitimate, in some cases, attackers might load malicious libraries or use them to execute code.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to Provider Lifecycle for powershell.exe. This could be normal activity, but when combined with other suspicious actions, it raises flags.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple powershell accesses, registry modifications, file creation and deletion in temp folders, and command-line executions of potentially dangerous tools like cmd and whoami. These patterns could indicate an attacker trying to escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, or execute malicious scripts.\n\nI should also check for any signs of persistence mechanisms, but in this batch, it's not clear if such actions are present. However, the repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines and file operations suggests active user interaction that might warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events do seem concerning enough to classify the batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system resources, creating and deleting temporary files, and other process activities indicate potential malicious behavior requiring investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving processes like powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Powershell is often used by attackers because it has built-in capabilities for system administration and can execute commands. The fact that there are several Registry value set tasks in the logs could indicate some level of persistence or configuration changes on the system.\n\nLooking closer, I see that powershell.exe is being called with command lines like \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This suggests that it's executing a script to delete a file in the TEMP directory. While deleting files isn't inherently malicious, combined with other actions, it could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nThere are also several Pipe Created events from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication. Malware sometimes creates pipes as a means of establishing a communication channel between different processes or components, which might indicate command-and-control activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry where whoami.exe is executed. While this is typically used to get user information, in certain contexts it could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\nThe numerous Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are also worth noting. Powershell relies on the .NET framework, so these might just be normal operations. However, if these DLL loads are happening in an unusual context or volume, it could signal something suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple powershell.exe instances with varying command lines, deletion of files, pipe creations, and other system interactions—this batch shows behavior that might not be typical for a standard user session. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration attempts, or efforts to avoid detection.\n\nTherefore, this batch is classified as INTERESTING because the combination of process activity, registry modifications, file operations, and pipe creations points towards possible malicious intent that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, deletion of files, and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activities.\"\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so that's something to keep in mind. The events show various actions like file creation, deletion, and registry changes.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there's a pattern where files are being created and then immediately deleted. For example:\n- A script file is created with a specific path.\n- Then, it's deleted right after.\nThis could be an indicator of malicious behavior because attackers might create temporary scripts to execute code and then delete them to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the use of command lines in powershell.exe. The command lines show attempts to remove files from the TEMP directory:\n- They're using Remove-Item to delete specific .zip and .txt files.\n- The paths are in the TEMP directory, which is a common location for temporary files but also often targeted by malware.\n\nThere's also activity involving registry changes. Powershell.exe accessing or modifying registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious scripts to survive reboots or maintain access.\n\nI also see events where chrome.exe and conhost.exe are involved in image loading and registry changes. While these are legitimate processes, the combination with powershell's activities might raise flags if they're part of a larger suspicious pattern.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event involving whoami.exe being executed. While whoami is generally used to get user information, its execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll files mentioned are related to Windows Defender, so their loading isn't unusual. However, the repeated access to these defender components might be part of an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Multiple powershell.exe processes with file deletions in TEMP.\n- Registry modifications which could indicate persistence or lateral movement.\n- Use of command-line arguments to remove specific files, possibly covering tracks.\n- Execution of other tools like whoami.exe.\n\nThese activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior. The combination of creating\/deleting files, registry changes, and the use of powershell for file removal are red flags that might warrant further investigation into whether this batch is part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes creating and deleting files in the TEMP directory, including attempts to remove specific .zip and .txt files.

{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events related to system logs, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first few entries are all about powershell.exe processes. One has a command line that deletes a file in TEMP, like Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\unidade_base.txt -Force. That seems suspicious because deleting files can be part of malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading images. These could be normal operations, but they might also be indicators of malicious behavior since scripts often interact with the registry for persistence or other activities.\n\nThen I see some file creation and deletion events from powershell.exe. For example, creating a .ps1 script in TEMP and then deleting it. This pattern—create a script, execute it, delete it—can be used to hide traces of malicious activity. It's also worth noting that these files are being created and immediately deleted, which might indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where other processes like conhost.exe and whoami.exe are involved. Whoami is typically a benign process for checking user information, but if it's called by another malicious process, that could be concerning.\n\nI also notice that some events mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle.\" These might not directly indicate malicious activity but could be part of the script execution process.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines each time. This variation could be a tactic to avoid detection by changing filenames or commands, making it harder for security tools to catch all instances.\n\nConsidering all these together, the combination of creating and deleting files in TEMP, registry modifications, multiple image loads which might indicate script execution, and varied command lines suggests potential malicious activity. The fact that several files are being created and then deleted quickly could be part of a cleanup routine after performing some harmful action.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell.exe processes with file deletion commands in TEMP, registry modifications, and file creation\/deletion patterns that may indicate malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice a lot of events from \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions. There are eight such entries, but nothing unusual there.\n\nThen there's an event from \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" also setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process, so that activity isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see several instances of \"powershell.exe\" being accessed with the ProcessAccess task. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, but accessing it doesn't necessarily mean something bad is happening. However, the frequency here might be worth noting—there are multiple accesses which could indicate script execution or other activity.\n\nThere are also events where \"whoami.exe\" is being executed. Whoami is a standard system tool that's often used to check user information, so its use alone isn't concerning unless it's part of a larger sequence of actions.\n\nOne event stands out: the creation of a file by \"winlogbeat.exe\" with a path ending in \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting Windows logs. This seems benign and likely related to log management, so probably not suspicious.\n\nAnother notable point is the creation of \"pacote_ativo.txt\" by PowerShell. The filename suggests it might be a script or configuration file, but without more context on its content, it's hard to say if this is malicious. However, given that it's created by PowerShell, which can execute scripts, this could be part of malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: there are several instances of legitimate processes doing normal things, but the multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell and the file creation in a scriptable context might indicate potential malicious behavior. While each event on its own isn't alarming, the combination suggests possible investigation is needed to check if these activities are part of an attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show unusual activity, including frequent PowerShell accesses and file creations that may indicate malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
