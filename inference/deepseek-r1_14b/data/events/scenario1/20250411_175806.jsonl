{"file":"data\/events\/scenario1\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: there are several instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are often used in scripting and can be indicators of malicious activity. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in encryption and can execute commands remotely.\n\nI notice that some events involve registry modifications. For example, using REG ADD to set values in HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is a common tactic for persistence; attackers often add entries here so their malicious scripts run on each user login. The command lines show specific paths being added, which might indicate a dropper or a payload.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files, like \"modulo_padrao.txt\" and \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". Powershell creating a file could be part of writing or downloading malicious content. The winlogbeat.exe events seem normal as it's likely an agent running, but the repeated file creations by powershell are suspicious.\n\nAlso, the multiple process accesses to powershell.exe without obvious legitimate use in this context might suggest command execution chains. The combination of registry edits and file writes points towards potential persistence mechanisms or installing malware components.\n\nConsidering all these together, there's a pattern of activities that could be part of an attack chain: using powershell for execution, modifying the registry for persistence, and creating files possibly related to malicious payloads. These events don't seem accidental but rather indicative of possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe accessing system resources, modifying the registry for persistence, and creating files, indicating potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
