Notably, there are several events of registry value modifications by a wide range of processes including 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe', 'Calculator.exe', 'powershell.exe', and 'chrome.exe'. PowerShell's involvement in both registry changes and process access raises further suspicion due to its power and common use in malicious scripts.
