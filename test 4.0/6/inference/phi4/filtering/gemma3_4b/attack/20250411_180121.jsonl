This can indicate an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat Execution**:\n   - The creation of a new `winlogbeat.yml.new` file suggests configuration changes, which might be benign but could also be part of a reconnaissance or logging manipulation effort.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Several events show registry value modifications by both PowerShell and Chrome processes. This is often associated with persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior.\n\n4. **Process Access and Creation Events**:\n   - The logs include process access and creation events for `whoami.exe` and other executables, which might be used to gather information about the environment or execute further commands.\n\n5. **Pattern of Behavior**:\n   - The combination of file deletions, registry changes, and specific process activities suggests a coordinated effort that warrants investigation.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the presence of multiple suspicious indicators that together suggest potential malicious behavior, though without definitive proof in isolation."}
