Malware often uses the registry to ensure persistence across reboots.\n- **Pattern Recognition**: The sheer volume of similar events in a short period suggests abnormal behavior, which warrants further investigation.\n\nGiven these factors, this batch of logs is classified as \"INTERESTING\" due to potential signs of compromise, with high confidence based on the established patterns of malicious activity."}
