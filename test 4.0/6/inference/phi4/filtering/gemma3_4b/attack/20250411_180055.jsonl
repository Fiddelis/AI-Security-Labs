The repeated Registry value set events associated with svchost.exe are a red flag for potential persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes. Additionally, there are several instances of PowerShell accessing processes and using 'powershell.exe' for potentially malicious activities such as querying user privileges (via whoami.exe) and process access.
