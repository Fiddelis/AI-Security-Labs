This process is typically used for managing source code and downloading necessary files or libraries, indicating routine activity.\n\n2. **File Paths Context:** The paths where the files are being created are located within a `node_modules` directory typical of Node.js projects. Such directories are standard in software development environments where dependencies (like Cypress) are stored.\n\n3. **Event Task Consistency:** All events uniformly log file creation under the same rule (`FileCreate`). This lack of variation suggests that these logs represent expected behavior rather than anomalies or malicious actions.\n\n4. **Absence of Red Flags:** There's no indication of unusual processes, unexpected locations for file creations, or other suspicious activities like rapid multiple file accesses outside typical development workflows.\n\n5. **Confidence Level Rationale:** Given the consistent use of a legitimate process and standard software development practices, there is high confidence that these events do not warrant further investigation as potential security threats. The confidence score reflects this strong alignment with normal activity patterns."}
