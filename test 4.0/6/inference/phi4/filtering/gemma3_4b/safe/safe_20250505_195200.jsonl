This pattern could indicate automated processes, which is common in malware activity.\n  \n- **Process Name (SDXHelper.exe)**: While SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, its use for creating multiple files in the same directory can be suspicious. It might be being leveraged by malicious software to execute or distribute payloads.\n\n- **Content Similarity**: The filenames suggest they are versions of some script or configuration file (`excel-copilot-strings`). If these are not legitimate updates or expected changes, it could indicate an attempt to inject malicious scripts into Office applications.\n\n- **Investigation Rationale**: Such behavior warrants further investigation because it can be indicative of a compromised system where malware is using legitimate processes for malicious purposes.
