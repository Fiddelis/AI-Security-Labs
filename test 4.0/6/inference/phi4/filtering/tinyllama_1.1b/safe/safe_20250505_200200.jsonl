The use of 'powershell.exe' in various contexts (process creation, image loading, file creation, and pipe creation) raises suspicion, especially when combined with activities like network connections through ssh.exe and unusual file creations such as a temporary PowerShell script in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp. Additionally, the presence of winlogbeat.exe events indicates potential log collection activities, which might be benign but could also suggest monitoring for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
