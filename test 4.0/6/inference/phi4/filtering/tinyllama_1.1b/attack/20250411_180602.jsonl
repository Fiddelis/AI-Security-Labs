The repeated use of PowerShell to access processes and set registry values, along with command-line invocation by 'whoami.exe' (commonly used in privilege escalation), raises suspicion. Additionally, the presence of multiple suspicious actions associated with 'chrome.exe', such as frequent registry modifications, further indicates potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
