The presence of 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', and 'svchost.exe' modifying registry values could suggest attempts to persist changes or alter system configurations stealthily. Notably, 'chrome.exe' loading unusual DLLs like 'amsi.dll' raises suspicion as this behavior is commonly associated with attempts to bypass antivirus detection mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
