{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and cmd.exe setting registry values are suspicious, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repeated Events with `powershell.exe`:** \n   - The log shows multiple occurrences where `powershell.exe` is involved in 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is a legitimate tool but can be abused for executing malicious scripts.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by Various Processes:**\n   - Several processes, including `cmd.exe`, `services.exe`, and `RuntimeBroker.exe`, are modifying registry values. Such activities could indicate attempts to persist malware or alter system configurations.\n\n3. **Unusual Image Load:**\n   - The loading of `urlmon.dll` via `calc.exe` is unusual as it doesn't directly relate to calculator functions, raising concerns about potential DLL hijacking.\n\n4. **Suspicious Registry and Process Activities Combined:**\n   - The combination of process access events (especially with PowerShell) and registry modifications across different processes indicates a pattern that could be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious commands.\n\nGiven these observations, the batch warrants further investigation due to potential signs of malicious behavior. The confidence level reflects the presence of multiple suspicious indicators but acknowledges that without further context, absolute certainty isn't achievable."}
