Additionally, there are numerous image load events for EXCEL.EXE loading DLLs from C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32, which is unusual and could suggest DLL hijacking or exploitation attempts. The creation of a new file by winlogbeat.exe in an uncommon location might indicate tampering with logging tools.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
