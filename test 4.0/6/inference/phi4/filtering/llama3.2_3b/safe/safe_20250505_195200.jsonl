The file type (`.js`, suggesting JavaScript) adds an additional layer of interest given its potential use in web-based attacks.\n- The confidence level reflects a moderate degree of certainty in this classification, acknowledging the need for further context and analysis to definitively determine whether these activities are benign or malicious."}
