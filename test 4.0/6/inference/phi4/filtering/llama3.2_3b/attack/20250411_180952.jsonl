The use of 'cmd.exe' to create a user and add them to the Domain Admins group is highly unusual, especially with a simple password. Execution of unrecognized processes like 'net1.exe', which mimics known system utilities but isn't standard, further raises suspicion. Additionally, 'svchost.exe', a legitimate Windows service, writing to an uncommon path suggests possible exploitation. Collectively, these events suggest unauthorized privilege escalation attempts and potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
