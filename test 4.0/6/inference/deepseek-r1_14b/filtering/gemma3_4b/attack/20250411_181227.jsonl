{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are from powershell.exe. That stands out because PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The command lines in some events show that they're creating scheduled tasks using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. They're setting triggers at logon and specifying high privileges, which could be a red flag because malicious actors might try to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking more closely, each scheduled task is named differently but all execute calc.exe. While calc.exe isn't inherently malicious, it's often used in examples of lateral movement or as part of a payload delivery chain. The use of multiple different names for the tasks suggests an attempt to avoid detection or create multiple points of persistence.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe accesses processes and modifies registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to run at startup. Additionally, some logs show image loads from mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. While these are legitimate files, their loading by PowerShell could indicate script execution or loading malicious libraries.\n\nAnother event involves chrome.exe creating a pipe and modifying registry values. While Chrome is a common application, unexpected pipe creation or registry changes could be suspicious, especially if it's not related to known Chrome processes.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with scheduled tasks pointing to calc.exe, along with other process and registry activities, raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The batch shows multiple instances that could indicate an attacker setting up persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges, indicating potential malicious activity for investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of logs to see if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. The first few entries show ImageLoad events with various DLL files being loaded. This isn't immediately suspicious because PowerShell does load libraries when running scripts or commands. However, the paths do seem a bit specific—like clr.dll and clrjit.dll which are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal.\n\nThen there are file creation and deletion events for a temporary script file: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1'. The fact that it creates and then deletes this file might be trying to avoid detection by leaving no trace. That's a red flag because attackers often clean up their files after execution.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where 'powershell.exe' is used with some command-line arguments. It looks like they're creating a scheduled task using New-ScheduledTaskAction and setting triggers for logon time. The action is set to execute calc.exe, which on its own isn't malicious, but the fact that it's running underAdministrators group and with highest privileges suggests potential escalation of privileges. This could be part of persistence mechanisms or to ensure the script runs at startup.\n\nAfter that, there are several events from 'chrome.exe' modifying registry values. Browsers do modify the registry for settings, so this might not be suspicious unless it's doing something unusual like creating new keys in unexpected locations or modifying system-wide settings without user interaction.\n\nThen, a series of events with process name as None and task type 'Execute a Remote Command'. This is concerning because if the process isn't known (None), it could mean that the logging mechanism didn't capture the actual process name, perhaps due to termination or obfuscation. Remote command execution can be a sign of remote access attacks or command-line attacks, especially if there's no legitimate reason for such commands.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell activities including creating and deleting temporary files, setting up scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, and then seeing remote command executions without known processes. These are indicators that could point towards malicious activity like persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within a network. The deletion of the temp file might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nWhile some events on their own aren't suspicious, the combination—especially the PowerShell script creating a scheduled task and then remote command executions—raises concerns. It's possible that someone is trying to establish persistence by adding malicious tasks that run at logon or startup. Additionally, the use of a Remote Command task without a known process could indicate an attack vector like a reverse shell or execution via another means.\n\nI'm also considering if there are any other factors. For instance, if these events happened in a short time frame, it might suggest coordinated activity rather than normal user behavior. The number of registry modifications by Chrome seems excessive, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the PowerShell and remote command executions stand out as potential red flags.\n\nIn conclusion, while some individual actions aren't necessarily malicious, the overall pattern suggests possible malicious activities, especially with the combination of PowerShell script execution, file creation\/deletion for hiding traces, scheduled task setup, and remote command executions without clear justification.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including PowerShell script execution, temporary file creation\/deletion, scheduled task setup with administrative privileges, and unknown remote command executions suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That sounds suspicious on its own because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like command-line attacks or remote code execution. But I need to see more context.\n\nThen, towards the middle, there's a process event with 'powershell.exe' being executed with some command line arguments. The command looks like it's setting up a scheduled task. Specifically, it's creating a new scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon, under the Administrators group with highest privileges. That's concerning because using powershell to create a persistent task could be part of an attacker's strategy to maintain access to the system.\n\nLooking further down, there are events from 'WmiPrvSE.exe' and multiple 'svchost.exe' instances accessing registry keys and creating files. SvcHost is often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The fact that they're setting registry values could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or install backdoors.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation of a file named 'unidade_comum' in the Tasks folder. This name doesn't seem standard and might be an indicator of malicious activity, possibly part of a custom malware setup.\n\nThere's also a process from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file. While this tool is legitimate for log management, if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could be worth investigating to ensure logs aren't being tampered with or exfiltrated.\n\nAdditionally, there are events from Chrome accessing various DLLs and registry keys. These could be normal browser operations, but they also might mask malicious behavior, so I'd keep an eye on them for any anomalies.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows several red flags: repeated remote command executions, powershell creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges, svchost accessing registry keys, and the creation of unusual files. These collectively suggest potential malicious activity that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including remote command executions, powershell script execution creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges, and registry modifications which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is a Registry value set. That's seven times in a row. I know that Chrome sometimes makes registry changes during updates or configuration, so this might be normal user activity. But it's worth noting because repetitive registry writes could be a sign of something else.\n\nThen there's an event where 'chrome.exe' does a DNS query. That's more typical since browsers need to resolve domains. No red flags here on the surface.\n\nNext, I see 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its data directory with a new .yml file. Winlogbeat is likely part of their monitoring setup, so this is expected as it might be updating configuration files or indexes.\n\nLastly, there's a PowerShell process creating a text file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but is also abused by attackers because of its scripting capabilities. The filename translates to \"auxiliary object\" in Spanish, which sounds generic, but sometimes attackers use such names. However, without more context on the file's content or execution chain, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nLooking at all events together: several registry writes by Chrome could be normal, especially during updates. The DNS query seems benign. Winlogbeat activity is expected as part of logging setup. PowerShell creating a file might raise some eyebrows because of its dual use, but without more info on the file's nature or behavior, it's not conclusive.\n\nConsidering all these points together, I'm leaning towards 'NOT INTERESTING' because each event individually doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The repetition by Chrome is likely legitimate, and the PowerShell action alone isn't enough evidence for an investigation without further context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include expected activities such as registry updates from Chrome.exe, a DNS query, Winlogbeat configuration file creation, and a file created by PowerShell. These do not indicate malicious behavior when considered together.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
