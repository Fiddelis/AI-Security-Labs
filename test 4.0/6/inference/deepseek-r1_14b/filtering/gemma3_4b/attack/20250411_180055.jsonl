Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and created. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The repeated creation of new PowerShell processes might indicate something is off.\n\nThen I see that several of these events involve registry value changes. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware, allowing the attacker to maintain access or ensure their code runs on every boot. This adds another layer of concern because such actions are often used by malicious actors.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted. The file path includes some randomly generated characters (__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1), which could be a way to test if script execution policies are enforced. If the file is created, run, and then deleted quickly, it might be trying to bypass detection or avoid留存 on disk.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events related to image loading within powershell.exe. This could indicate that PowerShell is executing code from various DLLs, which isn't necessarily malicious but combined with other activities could raise flags.\n\nThe later events show more commands using Compress-Archive in PowerShell, which is a common cmdlet for creating ZIP files. The paths used (like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"estrutura_temporario\") seem to suggest temporary or structured directories, possibly part of data exfiltration or malicious payload distribution.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines, registry modifications, quick file creation\/deletion, and repeated compression commands. These patterns often correlate with adversarial activities like script execution testing, persistence mechanisms, and data manipulation. The combination suggests a potential attack or unauthorized access attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed, along with registry modifications and file operations that could indicate malicious activity such as persistence or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several events where powershell.exe is being used with the Compress-Archive command. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. The repeated use of Compress-Archive could indicate data exfiltration or setting up files for later use.\n\nNext, I see that some of these PowerShell commands are creating ZIP files in the TEMP directory. This is concerning because temporary files can be used to hide malicious payloads or as part of a larger attack chain. The fact that multiple different paths are being compressed suggests that this might not just be a single script but possibly coordinated activity across different directories.\n\nLooking at the winlog events, tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', and 'Pipeline Execution Details' stand out. These are typical indicators of PowerShell activities, especially when scripts are being executed or modules are loaded. The consistent occurrence of these tasks in multiple events reinforces that this isn't just a one-off incident.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe is accessing the Registry (Registry value set). This could be part of establishing persistence mechanisms or modifying system configurations to aid in an attack. Additionally, other processes like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are interacting with the Registry, which might be part of legitimate operations but could also mask malicious activities.\n\nAnother event shows a file creation by winlogbeat.exe. That's probably part of log shipping, so it's not directly suspicious unless there's something else indicating misuse. Similarly, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is pretty normal and likely not concerning on its own.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the extensive use of PowerShell with Compress-Archive commands across different directories, combined with Registry interactions and pipeline executions, raises a red flag. This behavior could be indicative of data compression for exfiltration, creating droppers, or setting up a persistence mechanism. The variety of paths targeted also suggests a methodical approach that's common in attacks rather than random script execution.\n\nWhile some events might look benign on their own, the combination and frequency make me lean towards this batch being suspicious. However, without more context like timestamps or additional logs showing other anomalies, my confidence isn't 100%. But given the patterns, it's definitely worth a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with Compress-Archive commands across different paths suggest potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or payload creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine whether the entire batch is interesting enough for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **svchost.exe**: This process name often confuses people because it's actually a legitimate Windows process. It's part of the Service Host process, which runs various services in Windows. So, seeing svchost.exe isn't inherently suspicious unless it's doing something unusual. The event here is about setting a registry value. That could be normal or malicious.\n\n2. **Calculator.exe**: This one is interesting because Calculator is a standard system application. However, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. Here, Calculator is loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL used for URL parsing. So, not suspicious on its own.\n\n3. **winlogbeat.exe**: This is the log shipping agent from ELK stack, commonly used for sending logs to Elasticsearch. The event shows it creating a file in its own directory, which is normal during setup or operation.\n\n4. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe**: This is another legitimate Windows process, often associated with the Start menu and windowing services. Registry modifications here are common and not typically malicious.\n\n5. **powershell.exe** appears multiple times. PowerShell is powerful but can be used for both good and evil. Here, it's setting registry values and accessing processes. While this could indicate malicious activity (e.g., persistence scripts), without more context, it's hard to say. However, in a corporate environment, sysadmins often use PowerShell for legitimate tasks.\n\n6. **chrome.exe** has several events, mostly registry writes and loading DLLs like amsi.dll (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) and MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender). These are normal operations for Chrome as it interacts with Windows components. The repeated registry writes might be part of its update or extension management.\n\n7. **whoami.exe**: This is a standard command-line tool used to display user information. The event shows it being executed from the system32 directory, which is correct. No signs of tampering here.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch: Most events are normal and expected for typical Windows processes. There's a lot of registry activity, especially from svchost.exe, Chrome, and PowerShell. However, without seeing unusual patterns or deviations from baseline behavior, it's hard to flag this as malicious.\n\nI should consider potential indicators of compromise (IOC). For example:\n\n- **Processes with high privileges**: svchost.exe runs under SYSTEM, which is normal.\n- **Registry modifications**: Many legitimate processes modify the registry. Without specific known bad values, it's not suspicious.\n- **PowerShell usage**: Common in both scripts and attacker tools, but without malicious code execution indicators, it's not conclusive.\n\nThe only possible red flag could be multiple registry writes from different processes, which might indicate an attempt to create persistence or modify system configurations. However, the exact keys being modified aren't provided here, so I can't assess that.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are several activities that could potentially be malicious, there's not enough evidence in this batch alone to warrant investigation. The events described fit within normal operational patterns of a Windows environment.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes and activities such as registry modifications by svchost.exe, Chrome, and PowerShell; loading legitimate DLLs; file creation by winlogbeat.exe; and the use of Calculator and whoami.exe, which are not indicative of malicious behavior when considered together.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
