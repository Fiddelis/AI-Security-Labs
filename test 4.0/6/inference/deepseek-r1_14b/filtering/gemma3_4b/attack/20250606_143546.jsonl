{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of log events. I'm seeing multiple entries related to PowerShell executing scripts and some file operations. The user is concerned about potential malicious behavior, so I'll need to assess the entire batch for signs of compromise.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that include script imports. For example, one event shows a command line with an imported module path: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..componente_auxiliar.ps1\". That's a bit concerning because it indicates PowerShell is executing an external script.\n\nLooking further, there are file creation and deletion events in the Temp directory. Specifically, powershell.exe creates a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1 and then deletes it shortly after. This behavior might be suspicious because adversaries often clean up their traces to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process access event and registry value set by powershell.exe. These actions could be part of malicious activities like persistence or privilege escalation. The multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs seem normal but could also be part of script execution that's trying to load specific modules.\n\nThe batch includes events from svchost.exe as well, which is a known process used by legitimate Windows services but can also be abused by malware. Here, it creates a log file and sets a registry value. Without more context on what these actions are for, it's hard to say definitively, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it adds to the concern.\n\nPutting it all together, the consistent use of powershell.exe with script execution, file manipulation in Temp, and process\/registry interactions raises flags. These could be signs of a potential attack, such as script-based lateral movement or data exfiltration. The confidence level is high because multiple events point towards possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are executing scripts and performing file operations in the Temp directory, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let's see what each event is telling me.\n\nFirst, there are multiple processes modifying the registry. Processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe all have tasks related to setting registry values. That could be normal for some services, but I'm noticing that svchost.exe appears quite a bit here. Svchost is a common process for Windows services, but sometimes it's used by malware.\n\nNext, there are several events where files are being created by svchost.exe in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download folder. The paths look legitimate, maybe part of Windows updates? But the naming conventions like \"Mitigation.dll\" and \"TurboStack.dll\" don't ring any bells as standard update components. Plus, having multiple DLLs created in a row might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at image loads, svchost.exe is loading urlmon.dll, which I know can sometimes be part of malicious activities for handling URLs or network operations. Also, other processes like backgroundTaskHost.exe and msedgewebview2.exe are loading BitsProxy.dll, which is related to BITS transfers. If these aren't expected in the context of these processes, it could indicate something's off.\n\nI also notice powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. While PowerShell is common for legitimate scripts, it's often used by attackers too. The path seems like it might be part of profile data, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes, unexpected DLL creations in non-standard locations, and image loads that could indicate malicious behavior. This combination suggests potential malicious activity, so I should flag this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes, including svchost.exe, are creating files and modifying registry values in a manner that appears unusual or potentially suspicious, particularly the creation of multiple DLLs in non-standard locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the majority of these events involve svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that's part of the services host. It's not inherently malicious, but it can be used by malware because many legitimate processes use it. So I need to see what tasks are being logged under this process.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several \"Registry value set\" events and some \"File created\" events. The Registry changes could be normal system operations, but they might also indicate malicious activity if they're modifying sensitive areas like security or update policies. The files created include logs in different directories like Windows\/Logs, SoftwareDistribution\/DataStore\/Logs, and others. These could be legitimate system activities, such as updates or diagnostic data.\n\nI notice that some events have specific file paths like 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download\\\\...' which might relate to update processes. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created in these locations could be part of normal operations. However, the repetitive Registry modifications by svchost.exe are a bit concerning because attackers often use such techniques to maintain persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nBut on the other hand, since all events are under svchost.exe and involve common tasks like registry writes and file creation, there's no clear evidence of overt malicious behavior. There's no indication of unusual file accesses, network connections, or known malicious file hashes here. It could just be legitimate system processes or background activities.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'm around 60%. The events are somewhat concerning but not definitively malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few entries are all from svchost.exe. That's a common Windows process that can be tricky because it's often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The tasks here include registry value sets and file creations in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory, which I know is where Windows Update stores files. So, svchost creating files there could be normal for updates or patches. But sometimes, malicious actors might use svchost to drop files, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, there are events from MpSigStub.exe, which is related to Microsoft Defender. It's loading a DLL and creating several files in the Windows Temp directory with names like AM_Delta_Patch...exe. These look like they could be update patches or delta updates for virus definitions. The filenames include versions like 1.429.372.0, which are typical for software updates. So this might just be Defender doing its thing.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating several files in the EdgeCore directory. Setup.exe is commonly used during installations, and these files like cookie_exporter.exe or identity_helper.exe sound legitimate as part of browser components or helper services. I don't see any red flags here; it looks like normal software installation or updates.\n\nThere are also events from MsMpEng.exe loading Defender-related DLLs, which again seems standard for antivirus operations.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry isn't unusual—it's often involved with UAC and COM objects, so that's probably not suspicious.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe being accessed—Powershell is a dual-use tool. However, in this case, there's no evidence of command execution or malicious scripts; it's just being accessed, which could be normal admin activity.\n\nPutting it all together, most events seem related to legitimate system processes: Windows Update, Microsoft Defender updates, Edge setup, and Powershell access without any signs of misuse. The only possible concern might be svchost.exe creating files in SoftwareDistribution, but given the context, it's likely part of update processes.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion**\n\nThe batch of system log events primarily consists of normal, legitimate activities related to system updates, antivirus operations, and software installations. Key points include:\n\n- **svchost.exe**: Activities are consistent with Windows Update or patching processes, though caution is advised as it's a common malware tool.\n- **MpSigStub.exe and MsMpEng.exe**: These relate to Microsoft Defender updates, which are standard for antivirus functionality.\n- **setup.exe**: Installing legitimate components of Edge browser, including helper services.\n- **RuntimeBroker.exe**: Normal UAC-related activity.\n- **Powershell.exe**: Accessed but without evidence of misuse.\n\n**Conclusion: Not Interesting**\n\nThese events do not exhibit signs of malicious activity. They are typical of system and software operations, with no clear indicators of compromise."}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's a standard command-line tool used to identify user information. Not too suspicious, but maybe something to note.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe. The second event shows that powershell.exe accessed some resource. Then, another event where it set a registry value. That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking further down, the fourth event stands out. It shows powershell.exe executing a command line with \"New-Service\" and \"Start-Service\". This suggests that someone is trying to create or start a new service on the system. Creating services can be a way to persistence or elevate privileges, which is a red flag.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events for different DLLs when running powershell.exe. These could be normal as PowerShell loads various libraries, but the combination with other actions might indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there's an event where a file was created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like it's related to script policy testing, possibly trying to bypass certain security policies or check if scripts are allowed to execute. The quick creation and deletion might be an attempt to leave no trace.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Registry value sets by services.exe. While services.exe is a legitimate system process, repeated writes to the registry could indicate configuration changes for persistence mechanisms, like creating new services or modifying existing ones.\n\nPutting it all together: There's extensive activity from powershell.exe, including creating a service and file operations that seem suspicious. The combination of creating a service, using powershell.exe in an unusual way, accessing various files, and deleting a temporary script file raises red flags about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell, including creating a new service, file operations that may indicate script execution attempts, and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Each one shows that an image was loaded (ImageLoad rule) and the files being loaded are various .dlls related to the .NET framework, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These look like standard system components, so I'm not immediately concerned about these unless there's something unusual in their usage or access times.\n\nNext, there are events from \"powershell.exe\". The first event shows a file creation under the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory. That seems normal since PowerShell uses profiles to configure settings when it starts. Then there's an event where a registry value was set. Again, this could be part of legitimate configuration changes by scripts or user actions.\n\nLooking further, I see events where \"Execute a Remote Command\" is logged, but the process name is None and the file path points to a PowerShell script: componente_auxiliar.ps1 in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario. This script is being imported via an import-module command in the PowerShell execution line.\n\nThe last few events all have the same command_line string, which imports this PowerShell script and tries to invoke Invoke-entrada_principal with some parameters. The tasks logged are \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\", which suggests these are part of the normal script execution process.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a script being executed through PowerShell that loads various .NET components and runs on several machines. This could be a legitimate script running as part of system operations or maintenance. The fact that multiple events have identical command lines but different tasks might indicate repeated attempts or different stages of the same process.\n\nHowever, I'm cautious because scripts executing remotely can sometimes be indicators of malicious activity, especially if they're accessing unusual paths or trying to run with elevated privileges. But in this case, without seeing any signs like failed accesses, unusual file creation times, or known malicious script hashes, it's hard to confirm as suspicious.\n\nI think the events are somewhat interesting because they involve PowerShell executing an external script, which is a common vector for attacks. However, based on the given data alone, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. It could just be a legitimate script running.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving PowerShell executing an external script which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The first thing I notice is that most of the events involve PowerShell commands, which are often used by attackers because they can execute scripts and create services.\n\nLooking closer, there's a script being imported from \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\" and then there's an attempt to invoke something called \"entrada_principal\". This part is concerning because it's trying to run a PowerShell script with a specific command line. The fact that the same script path appears multiple times suggests it might be executing malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, several events show attempts to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using the binary path from another directory. Creating services can help attackers maintain persistence on a system, which is a red flag. The repeated use of \"New-Service\" and \"Start-Service\" commands in the same way makes me think this could be part of an automated attack or a script trying to establish a backdoor.\n\nThere are also events where the task is labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command,\" pointing to the same script path. This indicates that remote execution might be happening, which can be a sign of remote access tools or malware communicating with a command-and-control server.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple attempts to execute scripts and create services using PowerShell are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity. The repetitive nature of these events makes me confident that this batch is not just normal system noise but could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple attempts to execute a PowerShell script and create a service, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that each line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The majority of the entries (like 20 out of 23) have \"winlog\" task as \"Execute a Remote Command\". That seems repetitive but let me see if there's any pattern or cause for concern.\n\nLooking at the 'file' key in these events, most of them point to the same path: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The fact that it's a PowerShell script (indicated by .ps1) might be significant because scripts can execute commands remotely. However, not all remote command executions are malicious—sometimes it's part of legitimate operations.\n\nThe 'process' field is either \"None\" or points to \"services.exe\", which is a known system process related to service control manager. When combined with the logon tasks like \"Logon\" and \"Special Logon,\" this could indicate legitimate user activity, especially if services.exe is involved in starting processes during logons.\n\nI should consider whether these events are within normal operational parameters or if they're part of a potential attack. The repeated execution of the same script might raise an eyebrow. Malicious actors often use scripts to execute commands multiple times to avoid detection or to carry out different stages of an attack. However, without additional context like timestamps or other related events (e.g., failed logins, unusual file accesses), it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe fact that there are a lot of \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks on the same script makes me think they might be part of a larger campaign or an attempt at persistence. But again, without more data, such as if this script is known to be malicious, I can't confirm that. It could also be legitimate system administration tasks using PowerShell scripts for remote execution.\n\nI'm also considering whether there's any indication of failed attempts or errors in these logs, which might hint at malicious activity. Since all the events seem to complete successfully (or no error info is provided), it's harder to assess their intent.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple executions of a script via remote commands could be concerning, but without more context or evidence of failure or other suspicious patterns, it's on the edge. The confidence level isn't super high, maybe around 0.6 because there are some red flags with repetition and script execution, but not enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of executing a remote command on the same PowerShell script may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each event is in JSONL format with three fields: process, winlog, and file. The first thing I notice is that many of these entries are identical or similar.\n\nThe majority of the logs show \"Execute a Remote Command\" under winlog and reference a specific file path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script being executed multiple times could be suspicious, especially if it's not expected to run so frequently. However, since this happens 14 times in a row, I need to consider whether this is normal behavior or indicative of malicious activity.\n\nThe file path seems consistent across events, which might suggest that the same command is being executed repeatedly. This repetition could be part of legitimate system operations, like updates or scheduled tasks, but it's also a common tactic for attackers to execute malicious scripts multiple times to avoid detection or to achieve persistence.\n\nThere's also one event where the task is \"Windows Update Agent\" and the file is None. This might be normal if it's related to actual update processes, but combined with the other events, it raises some questions about whether this agent is being misused.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the batch as a whole shows repeated execution of a script that could potentially be malicious. While there's no definitive proof here, the volume and consistency of these events are enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events showing repeated execution of a remote command on the same file path.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
