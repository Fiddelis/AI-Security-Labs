Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are several events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal for a browser, especially when browsing the web, so probably nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, I notice multiple powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. The command lines show scripts being executed with commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem. Those are standard directory listing commands, but when combined with other actions, they could be part of a more complex script.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes, writes to the registry, loads various DLLs, creates files in the Temp folder, and then deletes them. The file creation and deletion within the Temp directory is particularly notable because that's a common tactic for malicious scripts to avoid detection by leaving temporary files briefly before deleting them.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with these specific commands might indicate scripting activity, possibly automating system reconnaissance or other tasks. While not necessarily malicious on their own, the combination of process access, registry modifications, and file operations could be signs of suspicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity, especially the use of powershell.exe with commands that often appear in attack scenarios. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show suspicious behavior including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, several entries have powershell.exe with command lines using commands like ls, get-childitem, and gci, which are typically used for directory listing. These could be part of legitimate activities but might also be signs of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Svchost is a common process, but frequent registry changes can indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or service manipulation.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which might be writing to files as part of their operation. However, the exact content or location could hint at data exfiltration or configuration changes.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, I see various activities like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and Process accessed. Some of these are common during normal operations, but the combination with the powershell commands raises suspicion.\n\nThe multiple registry writes by svchost.exe stand out as potentially malicious. Powershell is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities, and combining that with registry modifications could be part of creating persistence or dropping payloads.\n\nThere's also a logon event from services.exe and some special logon events without process info. These might indicate account activities or service start-ups, but they're less concerning on their own.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of powershell with directory listings and the numerous registry modifications by svchost.exe are red flags. This combination suggests possible malicious behavior, such as establishing persistence or moving within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing directory listing commands and several registry modifications by svchost.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events that I need to analyze. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of events with \"winlog\" task as \"User Account Management\". That usually deals with user logins, password changes, account creation or deletion. These are pretty common and might not be suspicious on their own unless they're happening in an unusual pattern or too frequently. But here, I see these repeated multiple times—nine of them. Maybe normal activity, maybe something else.\n\nThen there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is likely a log management tool, so it's normal for it to create files in its data directory. The filename has \".new\", which might indicate a new version or backup. Not suspicious by itself.\n\nNext up are events from RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe accessing the registry. These seem normal too because many applications interact with the Windows Registry for configuration settings. No red flags here unless they're making unexpected changes, but there's no evidence of that in the logs provided.\n\nPowershell.exe is mentioned, which can be a bit concerning since it's often used by both admins and attackers. However, in this log, it only shows that it accessed a process (ProcessAccess rule). Accessing processes isn't inherently malicious; it could be legitimate admin activity or script execution. Without more context, like specific commands run, it's hard to say.\n\nCalc.exe is next. It loaded the urlmon.dll file, which is a standard Windows DLL for handling URLs and ActiveX controls. Calculator loading this doesn't seem odd since system files are commonly accessed by various processes as part of normal operations.\n\nFinally, svchost.exe also made registry changes twice. SvcHost is a legitimate process used by many services in Windows. Registry writes could be normal depending on what service it's running. Again, nothing suspicious here without more details.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, most events are either standard user account management or common system processes accessing files and registries. While powershell.exe can be a vector for attacks, there's no indication of malicious activity in this log snippet—no unusual file creations, registry modifications that stand out, or signs of privilege escalation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't see enough evidence to suggest that the batch is indicative of malicious behavior. The events seem routine and within normal operational parameters.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events are related to standard system processes and user account management. No signs of suspicious activity or patterns indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
