Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first four events are all from chrome.exe with network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome handles a lot of network activity. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple powershell.exe entries, including process access and registry changes. Powershell is often used by attackers for command execution and can be a red flag if it's accessing or modifying system configurations without reason.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe events: one is creating an .exe file using csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. Compiling code on the fly could be malicious, especially if the files are created in temporary directories. The command line looks complex and might indicate some kind of script or payload being generated.\n\nThe next event is about a file creation by csc.exe for an .exe file. Creating new executables can be suspicious, depending on where they're stored and how they're used.\n\nThere's also a File Executable Detected event for another .exe file. This rule usually triggers when a file identified as executable is created or modified, which could indicate malicious activity if the file isn't legitimate.\n\nMultiple image loads from various .exe files might be normal, but combined with other events, it raises questions about what these processes are doing. Some of them have names like 'modulo_secundario.exe' and 'estrutura_ativo.exe', which don't seem standard and could be indicators of malicious components.\n\nRegistry value sets in several places can indicate configuration changes that might be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system settings for malicious purposes.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe event setting a registry value is also notable. While Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process, unexpected registry modifications from it could signal tampering.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated powershell activity, file creation and compilation via cmd and csc.exe, multiple .exe files being created and loaded into memory, and several registry changes. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior, possibly related to script execution, payload generation, or persistence mechanisms. The confidence is high because the combination of activities isn't typical for normal user operations and aligns with TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures) commonly used in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activity, including powershell.exe process accesses, file creation via cmd.exe and csc.exe, suspicious .exe file generations, and several registry modifications.

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: tarefa_base.exe loading clrjit.dll. That's a known legitimate file in the .NET framework, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext is elemento_ativo.exe terminating. Processes terminate all the time; it doesn't indicate anything malicious unless there's context about why it was running.\n\nThen cmd.exe and conhost.exe accessing registry values. These are standard command-line tools that often interact with the registry for configuration, no red flags here.\n\nNotepad.exe also setting a registry value—normal behavior since some apps might need to save settings or preferences this way.\n\nPowershell.exe accessed by another process. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but access alone isn't suspicious unless it's being executed with certain commands.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll—it's a legitimate DLL for URL handling in system processes.\n\nsvchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. SvcHost is a generic host for services and often logs these events; nothing unusual.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file—it’s an agent that collects log data, so this is expected behavior.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe doing similar actions as others—no issues spotted.\n\nMultiple instances of chrome.exe accessing registry values and loading known DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are standard operations for Chrome to function properly.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, most events involve legitimate processes performing normal activities. There's no evidence of unusual file creations, network connections, or privilege escalations which would indicate malicious activity. The repetition of registry access by chrome.exe might seem concerning, but it's typical for applications to modify registry settings during operation.\n\nI don't see any anomalies or signs of compromise in the logs provided. All activities are within expected bounds for a regular system usage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing typical tasks such as registry access, file loading, and process termination. No indication of malicious activity is present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to classify this batch of events as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". \n\nLooking at the event provided, it's in JSONL format with a single line. The process is 'winlogbeat.exe', which I know is related to Logstash and used for shipping logs. The event mentions that a file was created by this process. Specifically, the file path is 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. \n\nNow, thinking about what's normal: winlogbeat.exe typically creates or updates configuration files when it's running. So seeing a new .yml file being created here might be part of its standard operation, especially if it's updating its configuration on startup or after certain events.\n\nIs there anything unusual? The path seems legitimate for where such files would be stored. There's no indication of any malicious activity like an unexpected location or access from an unknown user. Since it's a file creation by a known logging process, I don't see any red flags here.\n\nConsidering confidence: It's a single event with nothing suggesting malicious intent. The justification is based on the normal behavior of winlogbeat.exe.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event shows a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a legitimate process for log shipping.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
