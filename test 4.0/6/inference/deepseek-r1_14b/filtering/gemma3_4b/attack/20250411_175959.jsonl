{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of logs to see if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity, especially when browsing the internet. I don't see anything immediately suspicious here—just regular browser operations.\n\nThen, looking at the powershell.exe processes, things get more interesting. The first event shows that PowerShell was started with a specific command line. It includes commands like 'net user', which gets user information; 'get-localgroupmember -group Users' to list users in the local group; and other commands related to cmdkey, directory listings, etc. These commands can be legitimate but might also indicate script execution or lateral movement.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell, loading various DLLs. This is normal for scripts that run .NET code or load modules. However, the specific DLL paths don't raise red flags on their own, but combined with other actions, they could be part of malicious activities like loading custom libraries or obfuscation.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event where a PowerShell script is created in the temp directory. The filename has some random characters, which might suggest an attempt to avoid detection by creating temporary scripts. Then, immediately after, there's a FileDeleteDetected event for that same file. This behavior—create and delete a file quickly—is common in malicious activities to leave minimal traces.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell is executed with the same command line as before, but under different tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle'. Repeated execution of such scripts could indicate persistence mechanisms or attempts to run malicious code multiple times.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated network connections from Chrome might not be suspicious on their own, but the extensive use of PowerShell with commands that can gather system information and potentially modify system settings is concerning. Especially when combined with creating a temporary script file only to delete it—this pattern is often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts without leaving evidence.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows behaviors that could indicate a potential security incident or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts and creating\/deleting temporary files, which may indicate an attack attempt.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event from the system logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with some command lines. The command lines include things like net user, get-localuser, and other commands related to user groups and directories. That's already a red flag because PowerShell scripts can be used for various malicious activities, especially when dealing with system-level commands.\n\nLooking deeper, the same powershell.exe command is repeated several times. This repetition might indicate that an attacker is running the same script multiple times or in a loop. It could be part of an attempt to gather information about the system, like listing users or directories, which is often a precursor to more malicious activities.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping and might not inherently be suspicious, but in some cases, it could be misused as part of an attack chain. The path mentioned includes \"data\" and \".winlogbeat.yml.new,\" which seems normal unless there's something unusual about how it's being executed alongside other processes.\n\nAnother point is the use of net.exe and net1.exe with commands like 'user.' These are standard command-line tools, but their misuse can be part of privilege escalation or information gathering. The combination with powershell.exe makes me think that an attacker might be chaining these tools together for a specific purpose.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity from chrome.exe modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome is a common browser, frequent registry modifications could be a sign of malicious behavior, especially if they're part of a script or external process. It's worth checking what exactly these registry changes are doing and if they're within the expected scope for Chrome.\n\nI also see other processes like SDXHelper.exe and updater.exe creating pipes or loading images. Without more context on these executables, it's hard to say, but any unexpected pipe creation can be a sign of lateral movement in an attack, where attackers use IPC mechanisms to spread across systems.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell executions with system enumeration commands, repeated net and chrome activities, and other processes creating pipes or modifying files\/registry. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these actions could be benign (like legitimate script runs), but the patterns here are concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious commands, including system enumeration and file operations, along with suspicious process creations and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to analyzing system logs for malicious activity, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the task. I have a batch of events in JSONL format, each representing some log entry from a system. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" based on potential malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'name': 'updater.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Google\\\\GoogleUpdater\\\\136.0.7079.0\\\\updater.exe\\\" --crash-handler --system \\\"--database=C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Google\\\\GoogleUpdater\\\\136.0.7079.0\\\\Crashpad\\\" --url=https:\\\/\\\/clients2.google.com\\\/cr\\\/report --annotation=prod=Update4 --annotation=ver=136.0.7079.0 \\\"--attachment=C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Google\\\\GoogleUpdater\\\\updater.log\\\" --initial-client-data=0x284,0x288,0x28c,0x258,0x290,0xb1d810,0xb1d81c,0xb1d828'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nThis shows that `updater.exe` was created. It's a known process from GoogleUpdater, which is legitimate. The command line looks standard for handling crashes and reporting issues. Nothing seems suspicious here.\n\nNext event:\n\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmdkey.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\cmdkey.exe\\\" \\\/list'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nHere, `cmdkey.exe` is being run with the `\/list` argument. This is a legitimate command used to list cached credentials. It's often used by scripts or users for troubleshooting. Unless there's an unusual context, like it being triggered without user interaction, this might not be malicious.\n\nThird event:\n\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nPowerShell is executed but only marked as accessed. No specific command is given here. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and by attackers, so this alone isn't enough to raise flags.\n\nFourth event:\n\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {net user\\\\nget-localuser\\\\nget-localgroupmember -group Users\\\\ncmdkey.exe \\\/list\\\\nls C:\\\/Users\\\\nget-childitem C:\\\\Users\\\\ndir C:\\\\Users\\\\nget-localgroup\\\\nnet localgroup}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Engine Lifecycle'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nThis is a more detailed PowerShell command. Breaking it down:\n\n- `powershell.exe` is executed.\n- The script uses `net user`, which lists users.\n- `get-localuser` gets local users.\n- `get-localgroupmember -group Users` fetches members of the Users group.\n- `cmdkey.exe \/list` again lists cached credentials.\n- Then it checks directories and runs `net localgroup`.\n\nThis seems like an enumeration script, possibly used by attackers to gather information. It's accessing sensitive data which could be part of a reconnaissance phase before an attack.\n\nLooking at subsequent events:\n\nMultiple entries show tasks related to \"Security Group Management\" without process details. These are likely legitimate system management activities, perhaps from group policies or user account changes.\n\nEvents involving `powershell.exe` creating files and modifying the registry are common for script execution but could be malicious if the scripts are doing something harmful. Here, the file path seems like a profile data location, which is standard for PowerShell profiles.\n\nAnother event shows `conhost.exe`, which is often used in legitimate contexts as part of Windows command-line tools. It being involved in registry changes isn't inherently suspicious unless there's an unusual value being set.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where `SDXHelper.exe` loads different DLLs, which might be related to anti-virus or system utilities. These don't seem malicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe initial events seem benign, but the detailed PowerShell command that enumerates users and groups, lists cached credentials, and checks directories is concerning. This kind of activity is often a precursor to more serious attacks like lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nTherefore, while not every event points to malicious behavior, the combination of these activities suggests potential suspicious or harmful intent.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event 1 Analysis:**  \n   - Process: `updater.exe` (legitimate for GoogleUpdater).  \n   - Activity: Standard crash handler with known parameters.  \n   - Conclusion: Not suspicious.\n\n2. **Event 2 Analysis:**  \n   - Process: `cmdkey.exe \/list`.  \n   - Activity: Lists cached credentials, which is a legitimate command but often used by attackers.  \n   - Conclusion: Potentially suspicious if executed without user context.\n\n3. **Event 3 Analysis:**  \n   - Process: `powershell.exe` accessed.  \n   - Activity: No specific command shown.  \n   - Conclusion: Neutral unless combined with other events.\n\n4. **Event 4 Analysis (Critical):**  \n   - Process: PowerShell script executed.  \n   - Commands Used: Enumerates users, groups, and lists cached credentials.  \n   - Activity Indicators: Reconnaissance activities often seen in attacks.  \n   - Conclusion: High suspicion due to information gathering.\n\n5. **Subsequent Events:**  \n   - Mostly legitimate system management tasks or standard script executions.  \n   - No malicious indicators identified beyond Event 4.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   The batch of logs includes a PowerShell script that performs reconnaissance activities, which is concerning. While not all events are suspicious, the combination points to potential malicious behavior, particularly in the information-gathering phase typical of attackers.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe entire batch is considered \"INTERESTING\" due to the presence of potentially malicious activities, specifically the use of PowerShell for system enumeration and credential listing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"INTERESTING\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...\\winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal since it's probably the log shipping tool creating its own config file. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nSecond event: SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll from system32. URLMON.DLL is a known Windows component, so nothing unusual there.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe created a file named modulo_base.txt in the same Downloads folder. Hmm, PowerShell creating files can be benign or malicious. The filename doesn't immediately ring any bells, but it's worth keeping an eye on since scripts are often used for attacks.\n\nFourth event: MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe was run with specific command-line arguments to check updates. This looks like normal update behavior, so probably nothing to worry about here.\n\nFifth and sixth events: svchost.exe made registry changes twice. SvcHost is a common process that runs many services, so registry writes are expected unless they're in unusual locations or at unexpected times. Not enough info yet, but not red flags.\n\nSeventh event: MicrosoftEdgeUpdate loaded taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. Again, this seems related to scheduling and updates; nothing suspicious here.\n\nEighth event: backgroundTaskHost.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Another instance of a known Windows component being loaded by a legitimate process.\n\nNinth event: winlogbeat.exe created the same file again as the first event. This repetition might be normal if it's part of their configuration or backup, but could also indicate something if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nTenth and eleventh events: powershell.exe set a registry value and accessed something else. The previous creation of modulo_base.txt along with these actions might suggest some script execution. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so this could be either routine or malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple instances where Powershell is involved—creating files and making registry changes. This combination raises some flags because attackers often use Powershell for lateral movement and persistence. Additionally, the creation of modulo_base.txt without a clear purpose in this context might indicate something malicious. The other events seem more routine except for possibly repeated actions by winlogbeat and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate, but those don't stand out as suspicious on their own.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of Powershell activity and file creation could be indicators of potential malicious behavior. However, there's not enough evidence to confirm an attack, so confidence isn't extremely high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files and making registry changes, along with winlogbeat.exe repeatedly creating a file, suggest potential malicious activity or at least unusual behavior that warrants closer investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
