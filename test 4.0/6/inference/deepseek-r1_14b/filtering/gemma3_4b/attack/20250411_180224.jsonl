Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. I notice that some of these events show Registry value sets and Process accessed tasks. That could mean they're modifying system configurations or accessing other processes, which might be a red flag.\n\nNext, cmd.exe appears multiple times with command lines that include creating scheduled tasks using schtasks. The commands look like they're setting up a task to run powershell scripts. However, the script paths mentioned don't exist (like NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1), which is suspicious because legitimate scripts would usually have valid paths.\n\nThere are also instances where schtasks.exe is creating tasks with specific names like win32times. These tasks might be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to run on startup or at regular intervals. The fact that these tasks are being created by system-level commands adds to the concern.\n\nI see several Registry value sets and Image loads for taskschd.dll. This is related to Task Scheduler, which could indicate that an attacker is trying to create persistent tasks or modify existing ones. The frequency of these events across different processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe) suggests a coordinated effort rather than normal activity.\n\nLooking further, there are events where svchost.exe is setting Registry values and creating files related to the Task Scheduler. Svchost.exe is a common process that can be exploited by malware to run arbitrary code, so this adds another layer of concern.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe which seems like it's part of a log management tool. It created a YAML configuration file, which isn't inherently malicious but could be related if it's altering logs or misconfigured.\n\nPowershell.exe also created a file called estrutura_geral.txt. If this script is creating files, it might be for data exfiltration or logging purposes, which raises the risk of sensitive information being stolen.\n\nThe chrome.exe events show multiple Registry writes, but without additional context, it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, the frequency and combination with other activities makes me lean towards something more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe for creating tasks with non-existent scripts, combined with Registry modifications by svchost.exe and others, suggests a potential attack chain. This could indicate an attempt to establish persistence, execute malicious scripts, or cover tracks. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicative of potentially malicious activity, including the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to create scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and repeated Registry value sets which may suggest persistence or attack vectors.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is typically used for forwarding logs, so that seems normal unless it's doing something unexpected with the files it creates.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes. I know PowerShell can be a vector for attacks because of its scripting capabilities. The creation of 'entrada_ativo.txt' might not look suspicious on its own, but combined with other actions, like accessing processes, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there's an event where whoami.exe was run. Whoami is often used to check user permissions or get system information. It's usually benign, but if it's part of a larger sequence, especially involving other scripts or processes, it might be concerning.\n\nLooking at the events together: powershell.exe creates a file and accesses multiple processes. This could mean that PowerShell is being used to execute commands or scripts with elevated privileges, which is a common tactic in attacks like ransomware or lateral movement within a network. The use of whoami.exe might be part of gathering information about the system before executing more malicious actions.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't super high because individually these events aren't overtly suspicious, but their combination suggests possible malicious behavior. There's no direct evidence of harm yet, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and creating files, combined with whoami.exe execution, may indicate potential malicious activity such as scripting or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
