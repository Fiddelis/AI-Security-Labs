Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"chrome.exe\" with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. These seem normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity, so I'm not raising an eyebrow here.\n\nThen, the logs shift to \"powershell.exe\". One of the early events shows that PowerShell is being executed with a command line that includes downloading files from GitHub repositories into temporary locations. The URLs are pointing to different branches and files like LICENSE.txt. This caught my attention because using PowerShell to download files from remote sites can be legitimate, but it's often used in malicious activities too.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where PowerShell sets registry values and loads various image files, which is standard for running scripts. However, the part where a file is created and then deleted quickly is suspicious. This could indicate an attempt to hide activity or remove evidence after execution.\n\nAdditionally, I noticed multiple similar command lines in subsequent events, each downloading different files into the TEMP directory. The repetition makes me think this isn't just casual script execution but might be part of a larger campaign or automated process trying to stay under the radar.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions by PowerShell can be normal, the combination—downloading files from GitHub, creating temporary scripts, deleting them, and multiple such attempts—points towards potential malicious behavior. This could indicate an attempt at script execution for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm not 100% certain because some of these activities could also be from legitimate processes, but the patterns here are concerning enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential malicious activity with file downloads and deletions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nLooking at the first four events, they all involve PowerShell downloading files from GitHub repositories. The command lines show that each is using New-Object System.Net.WebClient to download a LICENSE.txt file into different temp locations. This pattern of multiple downloads from similar sources might indicate automated activity or script execution. Since these are in the Provider Lifecycle task, it suggests they're part of system initialization processes, but multiple such events could be suspicious if they're not legitimate.\n\nThe fifth event shows PowerShell without any command line parameters, just being executed as a process. The sixth event has a file path pointing to a specific .txt file in the user's Downloads folder. This might suggest that a file was created there by the script. But since it's a file creation, it's hard to say if this is malicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nThen there are several events from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's unusual because Chrome shouldn't be modifying system-wide settings like that without user consent. Multiple instances of this could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nA later event shows conhost.exe, which is a Windows host process often used by scripts or tools to interact with the command prompt. Its involvement alongside other PowerShell activities might be part of executing malicious commands.\n\nAnother point is the DNS query event and the winlogbeat.exe file creation. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so its presence could be normal if it's part of monitoring setup, but in combination with other events, it might warrant closer look.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, Chrome registry modifications, conhost execution, and a DNS query. These behaviors don't necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own, but the combination—especially the repeated PowerShell downloads into temp folders and the unexpected Chrome activity—could be red flags. The confidence level is moderate because while each event has some suspicion, there's no clear evidence of malicious intent yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to download files from GitHub repositories, combined with Chrome registry modifications and a DNS query, suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

The user wants a single classification for the entire batch, considering all events together.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any red flags or patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\n1. **powershell.exe** creating a file: PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also common in legitimate scripts. The file path here seems like a regular user download, so not immediately suspicious.\n   \n2. **MpDefenderCoreService.exe** detecting a network connection: That's expected behavior from Windows Defender services monitoring the system.\n\n3. **winlogbeat.exe** creating files: This looks like part of log shipping or data collection processes, which is normal if that's how they're configured.\n\n4. Another **powershell.exe** setting a registry value: Registry changes can be part of legitimate configurations or malicious activities. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\n5. **powershell.exe** accessing a process: Again, could be either. Process access events are common and not always bad unless they're linked to other suspicious actions.\n\n6. **winlogbeat.exe** creating another file: Same as event 3; seems related to logging or data management.\n\n7. **RuntimeBroker.exe** modifying the registry: Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process, so this might be normal activity.\n\n8. **notepad.exe** setting a registry value: Notepad isn't known for making registry changes on its own, so this could be odd. Maybe an indicator of tampering?\n\n9. More **powershell.exe** accessing processes and modifying the registry: This is where I start to get concerned. Multiple events with powershell.exe doing different actions might indicate persistence or malicious scripting.\n\n10. **calc.exe** loading a DLL: The path here points to a legitimate system file, so no issue there.\n\n11-13. **svchost.exe** modifying the registry multiple times: SvcHost is a common process for services; these events could be normal unless they're part of known malicious activities.\n\n14. **Calculator.exe** loading the same DLL as calc.exe: No issues here, standard Windows behavior.\n\n15-17. More svchost.exe and powershell.exe events with similar actions. Powershell's activity is increasing here, which might warrant closer look.\n\n18. **whoami.exe** being run from the command line: Whoami is a common tool for users to check their permissions. Unless it's used in a specific way, it's not malicious on its own.\n\n19-20. Powershell and cmd.exe events again. The cmd.exe event has a command-line argument deleting a scheduled task. Deleting tasks can be part of legitimate administration or could indicate persistence mechanisms if done by unauthorized parties.\n\n21. **schtasks.exe** being used to delete a task: SCHTASKS is a legitimate tool for managing scheduled tasks. However, the use of it via command line with specific parameters might be suspicious depending on context.\n\n22-23. schtasks.exe creating and loading images: These seem normal as part of its operation.\n\n24-25. svchost.exe and cmd.exe modifying registry again: The repetition here could be a sign of persistence or malicious activity trying to cover its tracks.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes, modifying the registry, and even deleting scheduled tasks via cmd.exe and schtasks.exe. These actions are concerning because they could be part of an attack chain—using powershell for execution, persistence (registry changes), privilege escalation, or lateral movement.\n\nThe fact that there are several such events across different processes suggests a coordinated activity rather than isolated incidents. While not every event is suspicious on its own, the combination raises red flags about potential malicious behavior needing investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell and command-line tools suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. Seeing several instances where powershell is being accessed (ProcessAccess) and creating processes (ProcessCreate) might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some powershell commands have \"& {}\" which sometimes can be a way to execute malicious scripts or hide commands. Additionally, there are multiple calls to delete registry entries using cmd.exe and reg.exe, targeting specific keys like HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is concerning because attackers often remove traces of their activities from the registry.\n\nThe events also show Registry value sets and deletions, which could be part of an attempt to maintain persistence or erase evidence. For example, deleting entries related to run-time processes might prevent them from being detected on startup.\n\nConhost.exe is another process mentioned here. Conhost is often used by attackers as a legitimate-looking process to host malicious content, so its presence alongside other suspicious activities adds to the concern.\n\nWhile there's no direct indication of malicious code or known exploits in these logs, the combination of multiple powershell executions with hidden commands and registry manipulations raises red flags. These behaviors are common in attack patterns, especially during lateral movement or cleanup phases after breaching a system.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it seems like this batch of events could be indicative of potential malicious activity that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes with potentially suspicious command lines, including attempts to delete registry entries and hidden command execution.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a JSONL file. Each line is an event with details about processes, windows logs, and files. My task is to determine if all these events together are interesting or not in terms of cybersecurity.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But sometimes it's just regular user activity.\n\nLooking at the specifics, a lot of the events are ImageLoad tasks from winlog, which means they're related to loading images or DLLs. These include paths like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc., which are standard parts of .NET framework and should be normal unless there's something unusual about how they're being loaded.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted by powershell.exe. That could be suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly might be part of a script to avoid detection, but in this case, it's the same process creating and deleting the same file path. It doesn't look malicious on first glance.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a .ps1 PowerShell script file. The filename __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 seems arbitrary, which might be part of testing or configuration scripts. However, without seeing the content of that script, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThere are events related to Registry value sets and Process accesses by powershell.exe. These actions themselves aren't suspicious unless they're modifying sensitive registry keys or accessing processes in a way that's out of normal usage patterns.\n\nI also see other processes like winlogbeat.exe creating files, whoami.exe being run, cmd.exe with an empty command line, and conhost.exe. These seem benign and could be part of legitimate operations or monitoring tools.\n\nConsidering all these events together, while some actions by powershell.exe are notable, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior. The creation and deletion of files, loading of standard DLLs, registry modifications, etc., don't collectively point to an attack vector without more context. It could be a user running scripts or legitimate system operations.\n\nSo, the batch doesn't raise enough red flags to warrant further investigation beyond normal monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve standard PowerShell activity and file operations that do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is something we should look into. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first line is an event where cmd.exe set a registry value. That seems normal because cmd is a standard tool, and admins often use it for system tasks. But then there's conhost.exe doing the same thing with a registry set. Conhost is usually related to console windows, so that's a bit odd but not necessarily malicious yet.\n\nNext up is powershell.exe accessing something, which caught my attention because PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. Then whoami.exe ran without any arguments—it just showed the current user info, so probably harmless.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe is being accessed or modifying registry values. That makes me think—why is PowerShell accessing so many different files and registry entries? It's definitely something to note because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the file paths in the ImageLoad tasks, they're all legitimate .NET framework components. But then there are events where a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.ps1 was created and immediately deleted. That sounds sketchy because creating and deleting files quickly can be a sign of trying to hide something.\n\nAlso, the Provider Lifecycle tasks might indicate that PowerShell is being used as part of some automated process or maybe loading modules. The repeated use of powershell.exe with empty command lines in some events makes me think someone could be using it to execute scripts without logging them properly.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry modifications by different processes (cmd, conhost), extensive file operations by PowerShell, and the creation\/deletion of a script file. These behaviors, especially the script file's quick deletion, suggest possible malicious activity trying to cover its tracks. While not conclusive on their own, the combination raises red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by different processes and extensive file operations in PowerShell, including the creation and quick deletion of a script file, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances where Calculator.exe and chrome.exe perform tasks like setting registry values and creating pipes. These could be normal activities, especially from legitimate processes. I know that programs often access the registry for configuration settings, so this alone might not raise a red flag.\n\nNext, powershell.exe appears frequently. It's known that PowerShell can be used both for legitimate scripting and malicious purposes. The events show tasks like 'Pipe Created', 'Registry value set', and 'Process accessed'. Some of these actions are standard when scripts run, but the frequency here is notable. For example, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events from powershell.exe.\n\nLooking further down, I see a process command line for powershell.exe that runs a script: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}`. This command is attempting to delete a file in the TEMP directory, specifically \"objeto_principal.zip\". Deleting files isn't inherently suspicious, but combined with other behaviors from powershell.exe, it might indicate something more.\n\nThere are also events where conhost.exe and whoami.exe are involved. Conhost.exe is often used by PowerShell as its host process, so that's not unusual on its own. The 'Process Create' task for whoami.exe suggests a legitimate user checking their permissions or system information, which doesn't seem malicious.\n\nAnother point of interest is the file creation event in the profile data directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShellStartupScriptData`. This might be part of PowerShell's initialization process but could also be a way to persist malicious scripts if created by an attacker.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the consistent use of powershell.exe with various tasks that can be both legitimate and malicious makes me cautious. The repeated registry modifications and file deletions without clear justification in this context could indicate attempt at persistence or data deletion as part of an attack chain. While each individual action might not be suspicious, their combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\n\nHowever, without more context on the environment or user behavior patterns, it's hard to be certain. But given the number of events and the specific actions taken by powershell.exe, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting due to possible signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activities including file deletions and registry modifications may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, most of the logs show that powershell.exe is loading various DLL files and creating\/removing temporary files. This in itself isn't suspicious because PowerShell often needs to load different modules and can create temp files for script execution. The fact that they're being deleted after creation might just be part of normal script cleanup.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a pattern where a file is created with a specific naming convention (__PSScriptPolicyTest_*) in the user's Temp directory, and then immediately deleted. This could be related to testing or enforcing script policies, which is something legitimate scripts do to check permissions.\n\nThere are multiple instances of Remove-Item commands being executed against .zip files in the TEMP directory. The command lines show that these files are being removed without any error handling, which is standard for cleanup operations. Since these are just temp files, their deletion doesn't raise a red flag unless there's something unusual about their names or content.\n\nI also notice that some events relate to Chrome.exe loading DLLs and setting registry values. These seem normal as part of the browser's operation and aren't indicative of malicious activity on their own.\n\nThe only thing that might be slightly concerning is the repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments, but without more context about unusual commands or persistence mechanisms, it doesn't necessarily point to an attack.\n\nOverall, while some actions could potentially be part of a script's execution flow, there's nothing here that clearly indicates malicious behavior. The activities described are within the realm of possible legitimate operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal PowerShell activity including file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, loading of DLLs, and execution of Remove-Item commands against temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I've been given a set of log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag.\n\n2. **Event 2**: Another event from powershell.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\n3. **Event 3**: conhost.exe also sets a registry value. Conhost is typically used for console host processes but seeing it alongside other suspicious activities could be concerning.\n\n4. **Events 4 and onwards**: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, creating new processes with specific command lines, and loading various modules. The command lines include removing files from the TEMP directory, which might indicate an attempt to delete evidence or malicious files.\n\n5. **File Operations**: Several FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events show that a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 was created and then deleted by powershell.exe. This seems unusual and could be part of testing permissions or attempting to bypass certain policies.\n\n6. **Image Loads**: Powershell is loading several DLLs, which is standard but sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute malicious code.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple activities that are indicative of potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments deleting files in the TEMP directory, creating and then deleting a script file, along with registry modifications, suggests possible persistence or data exfiltration attempts. These actions don't seem to align with normal user activity and could be signs of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe performing file operations, deleting temporary files, modifying registry entries, and creating processes suggest potential malicious activities or investigation-worthy behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of events in JSONL format and wants me to classify the entire batch as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". They've also specified that I should return only one result in a strict JSON format without any additional text.\n\nFirst, I'll examine each event to understand what's happening. The first four entries show PowerShell executing commands to remove files from the TEMP directory. These look like attempts to delete specific files with names like \"registro_auxiliar.txt\". The use of \"-Force\" and \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" suggests that the deletion is being done without user interaction, which might be a red flag because attackers often try to cover their tracks by deleting logs.\n\nNext, there are events involving \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I recognize as part of the Elastic WinLogBeat tool used for log shipping. The creation of a .yml file here seems normal if it's part of the setup or updates, but I should check if this is expected behavior in the environment.\n\nThen, I see multiple instances where PowerShell is being loaded and interacted with. The process access events could be legitimate, especially if scripts are running. However, combined with the earlier deletions, it might indicate suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the \"whoami.exe\" processes, these typically just return user information and aren't inherently malicious. But seeing them in combination with other PowerShell activities might raise an eyebrow because attackers often use such tools to gather info.\n\nThere's also a series of events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome can make registry changes during updates or configuration, multiple identical events could be unusual unless it's part of a known update process.\n\nI should consider the overall pattern here. The repeated deletions of files in TEMP and the use of PowerShell are concerning. Additionally, the combination with other potentially normal activities like winlogbeat and chrome.exe might mask malicious behavior, making it harder to detect each event individually but more noticeable when viewed together.\n\nGiven that there's a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious actions, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\". The confidence isn't too high because some events could be normal, but the overall pattern suggests possible malicious activity. The deletions in TEMP are particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to delete files from the TEMP directory with error suppression, indicating potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few lines are all about powershell.exe being accessed multiple times with the ProcessAccess rule. That seems normal because PowerShell is a common tool used by both admins and scripts. However, seeing it so many times in a row might be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to say yet.\n\nThen there are events where whoami.exe is being executed. The command line shows it's running from the system32 directory, which is standard, so that doesn't immediately raise red flags. But again, multiple executions could indicate something if part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipper or monitoring tool, and creating configuration files is normal behavior for such tools. The path seems legitimate too, so that doesn't seem concerning.\n\nThe next entry again involves powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt in the Downloads folder. This filename translates to \"active package\" in Portuguese, which could be related to malicious scripts or packages used in attacks. Creating files with PowerShell is common for attackers to drop malware or execute commands.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell accesses and executions of whoami.exe might indicate someone probing the system or trying to escalate privileges. The creation of a file by PowerShell named 'pacote_ativo.txt' adds more weight, as this could be part of malicious activities like dropping files or establishing persistence.\n\nSo while individual events aren't alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior that's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe access and file creation may indicate suspicious activity; 'pacote_ativo.txt' is a potentially malicious filename.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
