I'm seeing multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is being executed with some command lines that involve taking screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory. That immediately raises my suspicion because using screen capture utilities within PowerShell scripts can be indicative of malicious activity, like screen scraping for sensitive information.\n\nAlso, there are several instances where Registry values are being set. This could be a way for malware to maintain persistence or alter system configurations inappropriately. The repeated use of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks points towards potentially unauthorized access or modifications to the system.\n\nFurthermore, there's the Command_Line parameter showing specific code snippets that execute Add-Type from System.Windows.Forms, which is used for capturing screenshots. This behavior isn't typical for legitimate scripts and is often associated with malicious actors trying to gather visual data from a compromised machine.\n\nThe consistent pattern of PowerShell activities across multiple events suggests an ongoing process rather than isolated incidents, increasing the likelihood of malicious intent. Given these observations, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it exhibits several red flags commonly linked to cyber threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with suspicious command lines attempting screen captures and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Each event shows a different filename being saved in the TEMP directory using a Powershell script that captures the screen and saves it as an image. This pattern suggests automated screenshot-taking, which could be legitimate or malicious depending on the context.\n\nLooking further, there are instances where files are created and then deleted in the TEMP folder related to PSScriptPolicyTest. The creation and subsequent deletion of such files might indicate a script trying to bypass certain policies or testing the environment's security measures.\n\nAdditionally, some events involve remote command execution without associated process information, which could be red flags for potential unauthorized access or lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several indicators that point towards potentially malicious activities. The repeated use of Powershell with screen capture commands, coupled with file manipulation in the TEMP directory and remote command executions, make this batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances capturing screenshots and interacting with system components, along with file creation\/deletion patterns in TEMP directory and remote command execution events suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at the JSONL data provided. There are multiple entries here, each representing an event from different processes.\n\nFirst, I notice that 'powershell.exe' appears a few times with tasks like creating files and setting registry values. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used for malicious activities, but not all uses are bad. However, the fact that it's modifying registry values could indicate some changes to system configurations.\n\nThen there's 'conhost.exe', which is another process I'm familiar with; it's often associated with command-line tools and can sometimes be a vector for attacks. It also sets a registry value here.\n\n'winlogbeat.exe' shows up too, creating a file in its data directory. WinlogBeat is legitimate software used for log management, so this might not raise any red flags on its own.\n\nA lot of the events are from 'chrome.exe', with many registry writes and some DNS queries and image loads. While Chrome can generate a lot of events, the sheer number of registry modifications stands out. Malware often uses registry changes to persist across reboots or modify system settings without user knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, one of the Chrome processes loaded 'amsi.dll', which is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface. This could be normal, but sometimes attackers might try to bypass such mechanisms, so it's worth noting.\n\nLooking at all these together, the combination of multiple registry modifications across different processes, especially by non-standard applications like PowerShell and conhost, raises my suspicion. While each event individually might not be concerning, their collective presence suggests potential malicious activity trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nI'm also considering whether this could just be normal system behavior, but the volume of changes, particularly from Chrome and PowerShell, seems unusually high for typical user activities. It's possible that an attacker is using these processes to inject code or alter settings, making the entire batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications across different processes including powershell.exe and chrome.exe may indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
