The logs are in JSONL format with each line being a JSON object.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's about whoami.exe being run from C:\\Windows\\system32\\. That seems normal, as whoami is often used to get system info.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe. Some events show 'Process Create' and others mention accessing registry values or loading images. One of the command lines catches my eye—it's using findstr and select-string with a pattern looking for \"password\". That seems suspicious because it could be trying to search files for password information, which is often part of credential harvesting.\n\nAlso, there are events where a PowerShell script was created and then deleted in the temp directory. Creating and immediately deleting a script might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running with potentially malicious scripts, searching for passwords, creating temporary files that are quickly deleted.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, many are related to PowerShell processes. For example, there's a command line showing 'powershell.exe' with specific commands involving 'findstr' and 'select-string'. These seem like they could be searching for sensitive information in various file types, which might indicate data theft or malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing different files and registry entries. This repetitive access could be part of a script trying to gather information or modify system configurations. The use of 'RegistryEvent' tasks suggests that the processes are making changes to the system's registry, which is common in persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are events involving other processes like 'svchost.exe', 'conhost.exe', and even some Microsoft-related executables like 'OfficeClickToRun.exe'. These could be legitimate operations, but when combined with the PowerShell activities, they might raise suspicion. For instance, if these processes are being used in tandem with the script-heavy PowerShell commands, it could indicate a broader malicious campaign.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple entries from different processes accessing the same types of resources, like registry keys and file creation events, makes me think this batch isn't just random noise. It shows a pattern of activity that could be indicative of an attack, such as credential harvesting or system configuration changes to maintain persistence.\n\nI'm also noticing repeated command lines in the PowerShell events, which might mean the same script is being executed multiple times. This repetition could be part of a loop or a scheduled task attempting to carry out malicious activities repeatedly, trying different approaches or targets each time.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be legitimate (like using notepad.exe to modify registry values), the overall combination and frequency of these events, especially involving PowerShell with potentially malicious commands, make the batch worth investigating. The confidence level is high because multiple red flags are present across various processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing suspicious command lines searching for sensitive information, combined with registry modifications and file creations, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like setting registry values, DNS queries, loading images, and network connections. These seem normal because Chrome often interacts with the system in these ways—for example, accessing DLLs is typical for running properly.\n\nThere are a few instances where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates files related to its own configuration. That also makes sense since winlogbeat is likely setting up or updating its data files.\n\nOne event stands out: 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting, but it's also often associated with malicious activities. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with the other events, I should consider whether this could be part of an attack.\n\nI notice that all the events from 'chrome.exe' are pretty standard and don't indicate any suspicious behavior on their own. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications might warrant closer examination because attackers often use registry changes to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThe DNS queries and network connections detected by Chrome could be part of normal browsing activity, like loading pages or checking for updates. There's no indication here that these are connecting to known malicious domains or IPs, so I can't classify them as suspicious based on that alone.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though they aren't provided), if all these events happened within a short period, it could suggest some coordinated activity, but without more context, it's hard to say. The fact that 'winlogbeat.exe' created two similar files might be worth looking into—could this be an error or legitimate update?\n\nThe critical point is the use of PowerShell creating a file. While not inherently malicious, in the context of other events and if there are signs of other suspicious activities (like excessive registry writes or unusual network traffic), it might indicate command-line activity that's often part of an attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination includes some potentially concerning actions, likeregistry modifications and PowerShell file creation, which could be signs of malicious behavior. However, without more context or evidence of overtly malicious activities in the logs, my confidence isn't extremely high but still notable enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications and network connections from chrome.exe, as well as a file creation by powershell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. That's suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when creating files.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creates a .yml file. Winlogbeat is related to log management, so this might just be normal behavior unless it's accessing restricted areas or doing something unusual.\n\nThen there are multiple events where processes like whoami.exe, schtasks.exe, and cmd.exe are being created or accessed. Notably, cmd.exe is used in command lines with parameters that delete scheduled tasks. For example, the command line \"\/c schtasks \/delete...\" suggests someone is trying to remove scheduled tasks which could be an attempt to cover their tracks or disrupt system functions.\n\nLooking at other events, there are several instances of processes accessing registry values and deleting tasks using schtasks.exe. This kind of activity often indicates that an attacker is attempting to persistence by removing monitoring tools or system checks.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with process access and registry changes adds up. Powershell is a common tool for attackers because it's legitimate but can be used maliciously, especially when combined with other suspicious actions like accessing the registry and deleting tasks.\n\nAlso, the command line \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete...\" stands out. Using WMIC to delete processes could indicate an attempt to terminate monitoring tools or legitimate processes, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of creating files with powershell, accessing and modifying system processes, and deleting scheduled tasks. These actions don't look like normal user behavior and are more indicative of someone trying to hide their tracks or perform unauthorized operations on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including Powershell executions, file creations in user's Downloads folder, and attempts to delete scheduled tasks which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a cybersecurity perspective. The user has provided several JSONL entries, each containing information about processes, Windows logs, and files. My job is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first entry involves 'WMIC.exe' deleting a process named 'notepad.exe'. That catches my attention because WMIC is often used for remote command execution and can be a red flag in malicious activities. Deleting processes might indicate an attempt to cover tracks or terminate legitimate tools like Notepad, which could interfere with malicious operations.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where 'WMIC.exe' loads various system files like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows components, but seeing them loaded by WMIC might be suspicious because attackers can abuse legitimate tools for malicious purposes. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is normal or not.\n\nThen, I notice several events involving 'powershell.exe' accessing processes and setting registry values. PowerShell is a powerful tool that's commonly used by both administrators and attackers. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might be concerning because it can execute scripts and modify system configurations, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nThere are also entries where other executables like 'cmd.exe', 'whoami.exe', 'net.exe', and 'net1.exe' are used with command-line arguments. For instance, 'cmd.exe' is being used to delete user accounts, and 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' are deleting users as well. This kind of activity could be part of privilege escalation or account manipulation, which are typical in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where processes like 'conhost.exe' access the registry, and some entries where the process name is 'None', but Windows logs indicate user account management and security group changes. These might not look suspicious on their own, but when combined with other activities, they could be part of a larger malicious campaign.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of processes being created, executed, and interacting with system components and registry entries. The use of multiple tools like WMIC, PowerShell, cmd.exe, net.exe, etc., each performing different actions that could be part of an attack vector. There's evidence of potential user deletion, process termination, and system configuration changes, which are all red flags in a cybersecurity context.\n\nI'm also noting the repetition of certain commands and the combination of different tools being used. This pattern suggests possible automation or script execution, which is often how attackers execute payloads to achieve their goals. The fact that multiple high-risk tools are involved increases the suspicion level.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these actions could be legitimate. For example, system administrators might use these tools for maintenance tasks. But given the specific command-line arguments and the sequence of events, especially the deletion of user accounts and processes, it's more likely to be malicious behavior rather than normal admin activity.\n\nIn summary, the combination of using multiple high-risk tools, executing potentially harmful commands like deleting users, and interacting with critical system components suggests that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation. There's a clear pattern indicative of possible unauthorized access or attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving potentially malicious activities such as process deletion, user account management, and suspicious use of system tools like WMIC.exe and PowerShell.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are several instances where cmd.exe is being used with commands like net user \/del and sc delete. These commands seem suspicious because they're related to deleting user accounts and services. Deleting users in a domain context could indicate an attempt to remove administrative access or cover tracks after unauthorized access.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being executed multiple times, sometimes accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands, so repeated use without clear justification might be concerning.\n\nThere are also a few instances where conhost.exe and whoami.exe are run. Conhost.exe can be used to host PowerShell in a window, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of hiding malicious activity. Whoami.exe is typically used to check user permissions; however, if it's part of a larger sequence of actions, it might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the command lines:\n- cmd.exe \/c net user \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain: This deletes a user account in the domain. \n- sc delete win32times: Deletes a service named win32times.\n- The same pattern repeats with different usernames and services being deleted.\n\nThe combination of deleting multiple user accounts and services, along with the use of powershell.exe for process access and registry modifications, raises red flags. These actions could be part of an attempt to remove traces of previous activities or to disable monitoring tools (like services) that might detect malicious behavior.\n\nI also notice that several events involve RegistryEvent tasks, which suggests that attackers are modifying system configurations, potentially to hide their presence or alter the system's behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems like there's a pattern of unauthorized deletions and modifications across multiple processes. This could indicate either sophisticated attack techniques like persistence removal, service disabling for lateral movement, or possibly data exfiltration attempts where they're removing evidence.\n\nGiven that the events span various processes and involve both command-line tools and scripting languages, the risk of these being part of a coordinated attack is high. The confidence level in this classification would be quite high, maybe around 0.9, because the combination of multiple suspicious actions across different tools and tasks strongly suggests malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletions and service removals via cmd.exe, net.exe, sc.exe, and powershell.exe indicate potential unauthorized system modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system events is something I should be interested in from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries where cmd.exe and powershell.exe are being used. Both of these are common tools for attackers because they can execute commands and scripts. The fact that they're appearing frequently might be suspicious on its own, but I need to dig deeper.\n\nIn the first event, cmd.exe is deleting two files: \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\". These filenames look like they're in Portuguese, which could mean this activity is coming from a Brazilian-speaking user or an attacker targeting that region. The use of del commands suggests file deletion, which can be part of an attempt to clean up traces after malicious activities.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is being accessed and created. PowerShell is powerful for scripting but also often abused by attackers for executing malicious code, especially with command-line arguments like \"& {}\", which sometimes obfuscates the actual commands run. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the logs might indicate that PowerShell is starting or stopping, possibly to load modules or execute scripts.\n\nLooking further, cmd.exe also accesses the registry multiple times, setting values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, where attackers store configurations or keys to ensure their malicious code runs on each system startup. This makes me more cautious because such activities are often used in creating persistent backdoors.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is run, which is typically used to determine user privileges and might indicate reconnaissance to check the current user context. Knowing this could help attackers understand their level of access within the system.\n\nAnother red flag is the file deletion event pointing to specific paths under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. Temporary files are often deleted by malware to avoid detection, so targeting such a location might be part of an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after dropping malicious files.\n\nI also notice that multiple PowerShell instances are being created and accessed. This can be a sign of script execution, which could either be legitimate admin tasks or part of a larger attack chain, like downloading and executing payloads.\n\nThe fact that all these events occur within the same batch suggests a sequence of actions taken by a single entity—possibly an attacker trying to gain access, move laterally, or execute malicious code. The combination of using cmd.exe for file deletions and registry modifications alongside PowerShell executions is a common pattern in attack behaviors.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these activities could be legitimate. For example, system administrators might use cmd.exe to delete temporary files or modify the registry as part of routine maintenance. Similarly, developers or admins could run PowerShell scripts for various tasks. But the frequency and specific actions here lean more towards malicious intent.\n\nThe high number of events involving both cmd.exe and powershell.exe is concerning. Attackers often chain multiple commands together, using these tools to achieve their goals, which includes initial access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a chance these activities could be legitimate, the combination of file deletions, registry modifications, PowerShell usage, and whoami.exe execution points towards potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high because each individual event isn't necessarily alarming on its own, but together they form a pattern that raises suspicions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of cmd.exe deleting files and accessing the registry, along with extensive PowerShell activity including process creation and image loading, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, I'm looking at a series of events where powershell.exe and whoami.exe are involved.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from powershell.exe doing different things like loading images (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll), creating files in the Temp directory, accessing processes, and registry changes. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The creation of temporary files could indicate something is being written or executed temporarily.\n\nThen there are several instances where whoami.exe is run with its command line pointing to C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe. Whoami typically just returns system information, but it's often used by scripts to check permissions or user context. Running it multiple times might be normal, but in the context of other powershell activities, it could hint at some scripting or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice that powershell.exe is also accessing processes and registry values. Process access events can indicate process injection or lateral movement. The registry changes made by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe might be setting persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe. That seems unrelated at first, but if it's part of log management, maybe it's normal unless there's something unusual about its execution context.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell with various actions and whoami.exe executions could be part of a script or toolset used for reconnaissance or lateral movement. The file creations in Temp might be for dropping payloads or scripts. Registry modifications by these processes are red flags because attackers often set registry keys to maintain persistence.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all this activity is malicious, but the combination seems suspicious. There's enough varied activity from powershell and whoami that it merits closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands, creating temporary files, accessing processes, and modifying registry entries alongside repeated execution of whoami.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about whoami.exe being created. That's a legitimate system command used to display user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessed something. PowerShell is commonly used for both good and bad purposes, so I should keep an eye out for how it's being used here. If there were command-line arguments, that might raise a flag, but the event doesn't show any.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values isn't unusual since it's part of Windows' User Experience features. Probably not malicious.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing registry values also seems normal, as some apps interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access—again, without more context, it's hard to say, but multiple accesses might be worth noting if they're in quick succession or unusual times.\n\nCalc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That's a known DLL for URL handling, so it's not suspicious that Calculator would use it.\n\n_svchost.exe_ is tricky because it's a common process name used by various services. Seeing it write to the registry isn't alarming unless there are other signs.\n\nAnother winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems related to log management software like Elastic's WinlogBeat, which is legitimate for sending logs to Elasticsearch. No issues here.\n\nMultiple instances of chrome.exe making DNS queries and establishing network connections fit normal browser behavior. Unless there's something unusual in the domains or frequency, it doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are standard system processes doing their thing—launching tools, accessing registries, using DLLs, and typical web browsing activities. There's no obvious sign of malicious activity like strange file accesses, unknown processes, or unexpected network destinations. The repeated use of PowerShell without commands might be a bit curious, but not enough to raise the alarm on its own.\n\nSo, I think this batch isn't particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard system processes and activities such as legitimate process creations, registry accesses, file operations, and network connections related to common applications like Chrome.
