{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. There are several entries here, all related to file creation events on a system. The common element across most of these is the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\". That suggests that a single application or script is responsible for creating multiple files.\n\nLooking closer, each event has the same path: C:\\Users\\...\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by different hashes. These are likely different versions or resources being written to disk as part of an update or cache process.\n\nI notice that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with Microsoft Office, possibly handling updates or configuration. The repetitive creation of similar files might be normal during an Office installation or update, where multiple JavaScript files are being cached or installed.\n\nHowever, the fact that all these events come from the same process and target the same directory makes me cautious. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate software operation, but it could also indicate malicious activity such as file injection or persistent malware trying to create multiple entries quickly.\n\nI should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known for such behavior. A quick search tells me it's often associated with Office add-ins and updates. So, in this context, the repeated file creation might be part of an update process installing various JavaScript resources needed by Office features.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'd want to cross-reference these hashes against known malicious files or see if there are any unusual patterns, like multiple writes to the same directory without a clear purpose. Since all the file names follow a predictable pattern with different hash suffixes, it seems structured rather than random, which aligns with legitimate update processes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity is concerning at first glance due to its repetitive nature, the context and known associations of \"SDXHelper.exe\" suggest that this might be part of normal Office operations.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path. The same file names keep repeating, which suggests that this is part of a normal process—maybe an application updating its resources or cache. These repeated writes don't seem suspicious on their own; sometimes applications write multiple small files when they start up or update.\n\nThen there's one event from \"explorer.exe\" creating a file in the same directory. Explorer is part of Windows, so it's legitimate, though I should check if this is normal behavior for explorer to create files here. It might be indexing or updating something related to offline content.\n\nI don't see any other processes involved, like services.exe or anything else that could indicate malicious activity. All events are file creation in the same folder, which doesn't raise red flags about data exfiltration or configuration changes.\n\nConsidering the consistency and repetition, these look like standard operations rather than signs of an attack. So, overall, I'd say this batch isn't particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events listed appear to be part of a legitimate process where files are being written by `sdxhelper.exe`.

Each event is a JSON object representing a file creation event by \"SDXHelper.exe\". All the files are in the same path under \"OfflineFiles\" and have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_XXXX.js\". \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with different hash-like suffixes. This makes me think it's normal for an application to create several files when initializing or updating. The fact that they all come from the same process and location suggests it's part of a legitimate software operation.\n\nI also don't see any indicators of malicious activity here, like unusual file names, locations outside the expected paths, or evidence of tampering.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. They're in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". I need to consider all events together and provide just one classification along with a brief explanation.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that many of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files. The paths all lead to the same directory: C:\\Users\\... \\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. Each file created seems to be related to some JavaScript module, as indicated by the \".min.js\" extensions. These could be part of a web application or script that's being loaded.\n\nThere are also two events from \"chrome.exe\" where registry values were set. That's interesting because Chrome is a browser, and modifying registry entries can sometimes indicate malicious activity or just legitimate software updates.\n\nI need to think about what these activities mean. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper could be part of normal operations if this helper is installing or updating something. But the fact that multiple files are being created in quick succession might raise a flag, especially since they're all JavaScript modules. It's possible they're legitimate, maybe from an application deployment process.\n\nOn the other hand, the registry modifications by Chrome usually aren't suspicious on their own. Browsers often modify registry entries during updates or installations. But I should consider if these were done in a way that could indicate malicious behavior, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, looking at all events together, there's no evidence of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or other signs of compromise. The files created don't seem to be system binaries but rather JavaScript modules, which are more commonly associated with web applications.\n\nI should also consider if the volume of these events is abnormal. There are 16 entries here, most from SDXHelper creating files. If this were part of a normal update or installation process, it might not be unusual. Without context on what SDXHelper does, it's hard to say definitively, but given that all activities seem related to file creation and registry updates, which are common during installations, I'm leaning towards these being legitimate actions.\n\nTherefore, after considering each event type and their frequency, I think the batch isn't particularly suspicious. Unless there's additional context indicating malicious intent, this doesn't raise red flags for a security concern.\n<\/think>\n\nThe entire batch of events is classified as \"NOT INTERESTING.\" \n\n**Explanation:**\nThe logs primarily show repeated file creation activities by \"SDXHelper.exe\" and registry modifications by \"chrome.exe.\" These actions are consistent with normal software installation or update processes. The absence of unusual patterns, such as multiple failed attempts or atypical access times, suggests these events are likely legitimate rather than indicative of malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is something important or not. Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, all the events are from \"SDI-Event\", which I think stands for some kind of security detection system. The source is Windows Event Log, which makes sense because it's a common logging system on Windows machines.\n\nLooking at the time stamps, they're all very close together—within minutes of each other. That suggests that something happened in quick succession, so maybe a script or automated process is generating these logs.\n\nThe event IDs are all 4025 and 1007, which I need to look up. From what I remember, 4025 might be related to file system activities, like creating files. The description says \"A file was created\", so that's consistent with the event ID.\n\nNow, looking at the details of each event. Each one is about a file being created in a specific location: C:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\{some GUID}\\OfflineFiles. The files are all named \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" with different hashes, like 6cbe6a5cdc44c9a54cabe06c1615d335.js and so on.\n\nSo, a user's Office app is generating multiple files in their local AppData folder. These seem to be JavaScript files, possibly part of some language pack or update for Office. The fact that the same pattern repeats suggests it's part of an installation or update process.\n\nI'm wondering why there are so many events—14 in total. Maybe it's normal when installing a new feature or updating Office. But I should check if this activity is typical during such processes.\n\nAlso, since all these files are being created by the same user and in their local directory, it doesn't seem like a system-wide issue or something that would affect other users. It’s isolated to one user's profile.\n\nIs there any indication of suspicious behavior? The event types are Informational for 4025 and 1007. If these were Warning or Error events, I'd be more concerned. But as it stands, they're just informative logs about file creation.\n\nAnother thing is the consistency in the paths and filenames. It doesn't look like a random script or malicious activity because each file has a predictable name based on the GUID of the Office package.\n\nI should also consider if the process creating these files is legitimate. Since it's part of the Microsoft Office Solution Packages, it's likely related to an update or feature installation for Office itself. Microsoft often updates its apps by adding new language packs or other resources in such locations.\n\nI don't see any signs of data being written outside the user's profile directory, which reduces the risk of system-wide compromise. Each file is confined within their own AppData folder.\n\nIn summary, these logs indicate that a user's Office application is installing or updating some localized resource files. The repetitive nature and specific locations suggest it's part of a normal update process rather than malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates a legitimate update or installation process by Microsoft Office, specifically related to localized resources. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Event Source and Type**: The events come from \"Microsoft-Windows-Security-SDI\" with IDs 4025 and 1007, both informational, indicating file creation activities.\n\n2. **Timestamps**: All events are within minutes, suggesting a batch process typical of updates or installations.\n\n3. **File Creation Details**: Each event reports the creation of JavaScript files in the user's local AppData directory, part of the Microsoft Office Solution Packages. These files (e.g., officeaicopilot-strings.min.js) likely contain localized strings for features like spell check or other language resources.\n\n4. **User-Specific Activity**: The files are confined to a single user's profile, reducing potential system-wide risks.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: This activity is normal during Office updates or installations, installing necessary resource files without indicating any malicious intent.\n\n**Final Assessment**: These logs represent routine file creation activities related to Microsoft Office updates and should not raise security concerns."}

The process creating these files is \"SDXHelper.exe\". First, I'll note that all events are of type \"File Created\" and they're happening in the same path: C:\\Users\\...\\Office\\...\\OfflineFiles\\. \n\nThe filenames follow a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_XXXX.js\", where each XXXX is a different hash. This repetition suggests that SDXHelper.exe is generating multiple JavaScript files with unique hashes, possibly for some kind of dynamic content or to avoid cache issues.\n\nI should consider what's normal here. If this application is legitimate and requires multiple JS files, it might not be suspicious. However, the fact that each file has a unique hash could indicate something else. Maybe these are temporary files being created during an update or installation process.\n\nAnother angle is checking if SDXHelper.exe is known for such behavior. I'm not immediately familiar with this executable's usual activity, but frequent writes to the same directory might be flagged. It's also possible that the system is caching or logging each file creation as part of a script or automated process.\n\nI should verify if these operations are expected under normal circumstances. If they're part of standard operations like content delivery or cache management, it might not be malicious. But if SDXHelper.exe isn't known for this behavior, it could be worth investigating further for potential malware activity, such as file injection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nTo sum up, while the current data doesn't conclusively indicate malicious intent, the repetitive and varied file creation is noteworthy.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this problem where a user has provided a series of JSON-like logs, each indicating that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in a specific directory. The task is to analyze these logs and determine if there's any cause for concern from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these logs represent. Each log entry shows an event where a file is created by SDXHelper.exe. The paths are all within the \"AppData\" folder of a user profile, which is a common location for applications to store data. Specifically, the files are being placed in \"\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\...\\...\\OfflineFiles\".\n\nI know that Office applications often use the AppData directory for storing various configuration and cache files. So SDXHelper.exe might be part of Microsoft Office's setup or a related tool. However, I'm not entirely sure what \"SDXHelper\" stands for or what its purpose is.\n\nTo determine if this activity is normal or potentially malicious, I should consider the following:\n\n1. **Process Analysis**: Is SDXHelper.exe a known legitimate process? If it's part of Microsoft Office or another trusted software, then creating files in these directories would be expected behavior. But if it's unknown or not commonly recognized, that could be suspicious.\n\n2. **File Creation Frequency and Pattern**: The logs show multiple file creations with different filenames (each ending with .js). This might indicate some kind of cache activity, perhaps related to Office templates or language packs. If the number of files created is unusually high or follows an irregular pattern, it might suggest something malicious, like a persistence mechanism.\n\n3. **Access Rights and Privileges**: Does SDXHelper.exe have appropriate access rights? Legitimate processes should run with the user's privileges, not elevated or system-level permissions. However, without deeper inspection of process privileges, it's hard to say here.\n\n4. **Network Activity**: If these files are part of a larger process that involves network communication, there might be additional risks. But based on the given logs alone, we can't assess network behavior.\n\n5. **Antivirus and EDR Detection**: It would be good to check if any security software flags SDXHelper.exe as malicious. If it's detected by reputable antivirus solutions or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems, that could indicate a problem.\n\n6. **User Behavior**: Is the user aware of this activity? If there are no symptoms like system slowdowns, unexpected pop-ups, or account anomalies, it might not be an immediate threat. However, persistent background processes can sometimes lead to issues over time.\n\n7. **File Analysis**: Examining the contents of these .js files could provide insight. Legitimate files would likely contain structured data related to Office settings, while malicious ones might have obfuscated code or suspicious scripts.\n\n8. **Process Monitoring**: Using tools like Process Monitor can help track what SDXHelper.exe is doing in real-time. This includes file operations, registry changes, and network communications.\n\n9. **Correlation with Other Events**: Are there other events occurring around the same time that could be related? For example, if these file creations are part of a larger sequence of events leading up to a malicious payload execution, that would be concerning.\n\n10. **Patch Levels**: Ensuring that all software, especially Office applications and Windows itself, is up-to-date can help protect against known vulnerabilities that might be exploited by such processes.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards the possibility that these logs are part of normal operations, but without definitive information about SDXHelper.exe's origin and purpose, there's an element of uncertainty. To be thorough, I should recommend further investigation steps to confirm whether this activity is benign or malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis and Conclusion**\n\nThe provided logs indicate multiple file creation events by \"SDXHelper.exe\" within the AppData directory, specifically targeting Microsoft Office-related folders. Based on the analysis:\n\n1. **Legitimate Process Check**: SDXHelper.exe appears to be associated with Microsoft Office, suggesting it is part of a legitimate process, possibly related to cache or configuration files.\n\n2. **File Creation Pattern**: The frequency and naming pattern of the created files (.js extensions) align with typical Office-related data storage, such as templates or language packs.\n\n3. **Security Considerations**: While no immediate red flags are present, it's prudent to ensure that SDXHelper.exe is recognized by antivirus and EDR systems as non-malicious.\n\n4. **Recommendations**:\n   - Verify the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe through official Microsoft resources or trusted security databases.\n   - Monitor the process for any unusual behavior using tools like Process Monitor.\n   - Keep software updated to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion**: The activity is likely benign, related to normal Office operations. However, further investigation and monitoring are recommended to ensure there are no underlying security issues."}

This process is creating multiple files in a specific directory under the user's AppData Local folder, specifically within the Microsoft Office Solution Packages. The file names follow a pattern with long GUIDs and \".js\" extensions, which suggests they might be JavaScript files or some form of resource files.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but I can see that there are 14 events in total. Out of these, most (12) are from \"SDXHelper.exe\", and one is from \"chrome.exe\". The chrome event creates a temporary file with a typical .tmp extension, which doesn't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nThe main concern here would be whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" is legitimate or potentially malicious. If this process is part of known malware, it might be dropping these files as part of its payload. However, if it's a legitimate application, especially related to Microsoft Office, then creating these files could be normal for its operation.\n\nI recall that \"SDXHelper.exe\" can sometimes be associated with software like Microsoft Visual Studio or other development tools, but I'm not entirely sure. It might also be part of system utilities or updates. To confirm this, I should check the process against known databases or recent reports on threat intelligence.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency and number of files created. The fact that multiple .js files are being created in a short period (as seen by the 12 events) might indicate some form of resource loading or caching. If this were part of a malicious activity, such as file injection or persistence mechanisms, it could be concerning.\n\nThe presence of \"chrome.exe\" creating a temporary file is less worrying unless that file's creation time correlates with other suspicious activities, which isn't evident here. It might just be a normal download or cache operation by Chrome.\n\nI should also consider the location where these files are being created. The path seems legitimate for user-specific data and application resources, but without more context on what \"SDXHelper.exe\" does, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nIn summary, while there's no concrete evidence of malicious activity in these logs alone, the repeated creation of numerous .js files by an unfamiliar process could warrant further investigation. It would be prudent to check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process on this system and review any recent software installations or updates that might relate to it.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of system log events does not currently indicate malicious activity but may require additional scrutiny for confirmation.\n\n1. **Process Identification**: The majority of the events are generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process's legitimacy needs verification. It could be associated with legitimate software (e.g., Microsoft Office-related tools) or potentially malware.\n\n2. **File Creation Activity**: The creation of multiple .js files in a specific directory might be normal for certain applications, such as caching or resource loading. However, unusual file generation patterns should be monitored.\n\n3. **Chrome Activity**: The single event from \"chrome.exe\" creating a temporary file is likely benign unless it correlates with other suspicious activities.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Verify the legitimacy of \"SDXHelper.exe\" through reputable sources or system process checks.\n- Monitor for any additional unusual activity related to this process or the specified directory.\n- Consider conducting a deeper inspection of the created files if there's suspicion, possibly using antivirus software or file analysis tools."}

SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar; maybe it's part of Microsoft Office? I should check if this is legitimate behavior for that software. If it's creating several JavaScript files, perhaps these are cached or temporary resources used by Office features.\n\nBut wait, the same process creating multiple files in a specific pattern could also be a sign of something malicious. Maybe each file has the same content but different hashes? Or maybe it's part of some exploit where files are being written rapidly to the disk, which could cause performance issues or indicate an attack.\n\nI should consider if this is expected behavior for Office. I recall that Microsoft Office does use package resources and might cache files locally. If these .js files are related to add-ins or web-based content within Office, their creation would be normal during usage.\n\nOn the other hand, if this activity spikes suddenly and isn't correlated with actual user actions, it could indicate something like a file injection attack or a script being executed maliciously. The naming convention of the files is consistent but random-looking, which might be how some malware generates filenames to avoid detection.\n\nI need to look into what these .js files contain. Are they legitimate parts of Office, or are they scripts that could execute on the system? If I can't identify a clear reason for their creation within normal operations, then it's a red flag.\n\nAlso, considering the volume—there are 14 events here, each writing a file with incremental or random names—I wonder if this is part of a larger pattern. Maybe the process is meant to write many files quickly, which could be a way to test system defenses or cause resource exhaustion.\n\nI should check logs for similar activity before and after this period to see if it's a one-time occurrence or part of a trend. If this is the first time I'm seeing such behavior, it might not be malicious, but if it repeats or escalates, that would be concerning.\n\nAnother angle: could these files be dropped by another process? Maybe an installer or an update mechanism that's writing these resources as part of its setup. But since they're all from SDXHelper.exe, which I think is tied to Office, it's more likely related to normal operations.\n\nI'm also thinking about how to prevent such activities in the future. If this is legitimate, maybe there's a way to optimize or allowlist these writes. If not, then blocking the process or investigating further would be necessary.\n\nIn summary, while at first glance the repeated file creation might seem suspicious, it could very well be normal for Microsoft Office's operation. However, without more context, I can't be certain. I should research whether others have seen similar behavior with SDXHelper.exe creating multiple .js files and if that's a known legitimate action or a sign of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows the process `sdxhelper.exe` creating multiple `.js` files in a specific directory, which is likely part of Microsoft Office's normal operation.

Let's go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData folder. The file paths all have similar names but different hashes at the end, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_db873a38863745837a95c.js\". This repetition makes me think it's part of a process that's downloading or caching multiple files, maybe for an application update or some resource-heavy task.\n\nThen there are two events from \"chrome.exe\": one setting a registry value and another loading the urlmon.dll. Those seem normal because Chrome often interacts with system components. The other event from chrome is loading MpOAV.dll, which I know is related to Windows Defender's anti-malware platform, so that's just regular antivirus activity.\n\nThe only thing that raises an eyebrow is the \"Registry value set\" by chrome.exe. While browsers do modify registry settings for updates or configurations, it's worth keeping an eye on because sometimes malicious software can make unauthorized changes there. But in this case, since it's Chrome and the event type is a standard action, I'm leaning towards it being benign.\n\nOverall, most of these events are normal background processes. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper might be part of legitimate caching or setup for an application, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.

Each line is an event with some process info, windows log tasks, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from two processes: chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe. Chrome is doing various things like loading images, setting registry values, creating files, and making DNS queries. SDXHelper is mostly about creating files related to Office packages, specifically something called \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" with different hashes.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the windows logs, chrome.exe is handling image loads, file creations, registry changes, and DNS queries. These are pretty standard activities for a browser process—loading images from websites, saving files, adjusting settings via the registry, and resolving domain names.\n\nFor SDXHelper.exe, all the events are about creating files in specific paths under AppData. The paths look legitimate, part of Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. So that seems normal too; these could be updates or package resources being installed or cached.\n\nI also see multiple instances where chrome.exe is interacting with a file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and its zone identifier. This looks like Chrome is handling a download, possibly extracting or writing to this file. The repeated file stream creations might be due to the browser saving the file in chunks or verifying it.\n\nThe files created by SDXHelper.exe are all under the same package ID, which suggests they're part of an Office update or feature. No signs of unusual paths or behaviors there.\n\nConsidering the combination, none of these events stand out as malicious. They're all within expected bounds for a browser and Office-related processes. There's no indication of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or file operations in restricted areas.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It looks like normal user activity with Chrome browsing and Office handling updates or package resources.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal activities such as file creation, image loading, registry modifications, and DNS queries related to common processes (chrome.exe) and legitimate Microsoft Office operations (SDXHelper.exe).

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the same path with different filenames. Each has a unique file path ending with various .js files. This seems repetitive and could be part of normal operations, maybe related to Office updates or package resources being downloaded. Since they're all under the same parent directory and named consistently, it's likely legitimate.\n\nNext, there are events from \"chrome.exe\" loading the URLMON.DLL file and setting a registry value. These actions are standard for Chrome's operation, especially when dealing with URLs and configuration settings. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nThen, an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a new config file in its directory. This is expected behavior since winlogbeat probably updates its configurations periodically. Nothing suspicious about that.\n\nThere's also an Excel process starting and opening a .xlsx file. The command line shows the correct path, and it's loading standard system files like COMBASE.DLL. No anomalies here, as this is typical when opening Excel documents.\n\nLastly, another SDXHelper.exe creating a file under a different package ID but following the same pattern as before. Again, consistent with normal operations.\n\nConsidering all these events, they don't show any signs of unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or unexpected behavior. They're all within expected baselines for user activity and software operation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided do not indicate any suspicious or malicious activities. They appear to be normal operational logs from legitimate processes such as `SDXHelper.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `winlogbeat.exe`, and `EXCEL.EXE`. The events include file creations, image loads, and process creations, which are typical for these types of applications.\n\nIf there were signs of malicious activity, you might expect to see things like:\n\n1. **Unusual Process Creation**: Processes that do not match known legitimate processes or executables.\n2. **Unexpected File Access**: Files being created or modified in unexpected locations, especially system directories.\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Registry changes that are not typical for legitimate software operations.\n4. **Network Activity**: Connections to unknown or suspicious network locations.\n\nIn this case, all the activities seem to be related to normal user operations and application behavior.

Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events where Excel.EXE is loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoréei.dll, urlmon.dll, and combase.dll. These are all legitimate components used by Excel for functionality, so that doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nThen there are several FileCreate events from SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office Solution Packages directory. I'm not familiar with SDXHelper.exe off the top of my head, but it sounds like it's part of Microsoft's Office suite, possibly related to updates or package resources. Since these files are under a user's AppData folder, they might be temporary or cache files, which is normal.\n\nI also see multiple Registry value set events from svchost.exe and HxTsr.exe. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process that hosts services, so registry changes here aren't unusual unless they're modifying sensitive areas without reason. HxTsr.exe might be related to anti-virus or system protection, so its activity should be monitored but not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThere's a File Delete event for an Excel file in the Downloads folder. The filename has a tilde (~$) which indicates it's an auto-recovered file. This is standard behavior when Excel saves temporary versions of files, especially if the user didn't save their work before closing or encountering an error.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they don't show any signs of malicious activity like unexpected file creations in restricted areas, unusual registry modifications, or processes running outside of their typical behaviors. The repetition of certain tasks, like multiple FileCreate calls from Excel and SDXHelper.exe, seems consistent with normal operations rather than an attack.\n\nI'm not detecting any anomalies or deviations from standard user activity. All the actions are related to legitimate software components and normal file management. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation for malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system operations with no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

There are 14 JSON objects here, each representing a different event. My job is to determine whether this entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". \n\nFirst, let's understand what each event is about. Each line starts with the process name, followed by a Windows log task, and then a file path.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that they all come from \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and the files being created are JavaScript files in different language directories. For example, paths like \"am-et-ui-strings-json...\", \"ar-sa-ui-strings-json...\", etc., suggest these might be localized strings for an application.\n\nThen, there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\". These tasks involve creating file streams and loading images. Specifically, they're creating files in the Temp directory under a long package name and also interacting with system DLLs like \"coml2.dll\" and \"VBEUI.DLL\".\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these activities are suspicious or normal. \n\nStarting with SDXHelper.exe: This process is typically associated with Microsoft Office add-ins or solutions. The files it's creating seem to be part of the package resources for different languages. Since they're being created, this is likely during a normal installation or update process of an Office component.\n\nNext, looking at Excel events: Creating temporary files in the Temp directory and loading standard DLLs are common operations for applications like Excel when processing data or initializing. The mention of Zone.Identifier suggests it's handling files from different zones, perhaps related to security settings or file origin tracking.\n\nI also notice that each event is duplicated a couple of times. For example, \"SDXHelper.exe\" creates the same JS file twice. Similarly, Excel events for creating streams and loading DLLs are repeated. This duplication doesn't raise any red flags; it could be due to multiple processes or threads handling these tasks.\n\nNo signs of unusual file accesses, such as writing to system directories or execution from unexpected locations. The files created by SDXHelper.exe are in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office, which is a standard location for application data.\n\nConsidering all this, it doesn't appear that any malicious activities are taking place here. These events seem to be part of normal operations for Microsoft Office components.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events can be classified as follows:\n\n**Classification: NOT INTERESTING**\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The events involve standard operations by legitimate processes (SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE) related to creating localized resources and handling temporary files and DLLs, which are typical during normal application execution.\n- No signs of malicious or suspicious activities are present in the logs."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That sounds normal since winlogbeat is likely an agent collecting logs, so it might be setting up its configuration files. Not a red flag here.\n\nNext, I see multiple events from SDXHelper.exe creating several JavaScript files in different paths under Office's SolutionPackages. The same process creates these files repeatedly—twice for fabric_9633a60e8aeb23f94615c4de4ed6ad04.js and then four times each for the other two files. That seems a bit repetitive. I wonder if this is part of a legitimate update or maybe something malicious trying to write multiple scripts.\n\nThen, there are events from Explorer.EXE setting registry values. Windows services often do that, so it's not unusual. The same goes for EXCEL.EXE setting registry values—it could be Excel interacting with certain settings or add-ins.\n\nBut looking closer at the SDXHelper.exe entries, they're all FileCreate tasks in the same directory structure but different filenames each time. This could indicate some kind of script injection or file creation activity that's not typical. The repetition might suggest an attempt to write multiple files quickly, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or a way to spread malicious scripts.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE events creating LNK files in the Recent folder also seem normal if Excel is just saving shortcuts there. Registry changes by both Explorer and Excel are standard for application behavior.\n\nHowever, considering all these events together, especially the multiple file creations from SDXHelper.exe, I'm leaning towards this being interesting. The repeated creation of specific JS files might not be typical user activity and could indicate suspicious behavior like script injection or attempts to modify Office settings in a way that's not normal.\n\nI also notice that there are two entries for each JavaScript file path under different package IDs. This duplication might suggest an attempt to write the same file multiple times, which could be a sign of something gone wrong or malicious activity trying to ensure persistence across restarts.\n\nOverall, while some events on their own aren't concerning, the combination and repetition make me think there's more to investigate here.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe batch of system logs contains several notable events:\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe**: Creating a configuration file is normal for log collection agents, indicating no immediate concern.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe**: Creates multiple JavaScript files in Office directories. The repetitive nature suggests potential suspicious activity, possibly script injection or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE**: Registry modifications are common for system and application operations but combined with other events, they warrant attention.\n\n4. **EXCEL.EXE**: Creating LNK files in the Recent folder is typical user behavior, so no concern here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe, specifically multiple JavaScript files under Office packages, indicate potential malicious activity or unusual script injection attempts. Therefore, this batch of events is deemed **interesting** and warrants further investigation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"interesting\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe suggest possible suspicious activity.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from Excel.exe setting registry values. There are a lot of these—20 entries all similar, each showing EXCEL.EXE making changes to the Windows Registry. Now, Excel is a common application, and it does use the Registry for configuration, so this isn't necessarily suspicious on its own. However, seeing the same process perform multiple writes might be worth looking into because excessive registry activity can sometimes indicate malicious behavior like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are two more events from SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData directory. These files have long GUID-like names and end with .js, which makes me think they're JavaScript files possibly related to Office add-ins or solutions. SDXHelper is often associated with Microsoft Office components, so this might be normal behavior for updates or customizations.\n\nI'm considering whether these events together should raise an alarm. The Excel activity seems repetitive but perhaps expected if the system is performing configuration tasks repeatedly. However, 20 identical registry writes from the same process in a short period could be a red flag—malware often uses such techniques to establish persistence. On the other hand, it's possible that Excel or another legitimate process is doing this for updates or settings.\n\nThe SDXHelper events creating files don't seem immediately suspicious since they're part of known Microsoft processes handling Office packages. But I should check if these specific file paths and names are standard or if they deviate from usual patterns.\n\nI'm also thinking about the overall volume—20 identical events plus a couple more might indicate something automated or script-based, which could be either normal or malicious depending on context. Without additional info like timestamps or other related logs, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nIn summary, while there's some cause for concern with the repetitive Excel.exe registry writes, the SDXHelper activity appears benign. However, the number of registry changes from Excel is notable enough that it might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical registry write events from EXCEL.EXE may indicate potential malicious behavior or unusual system configuration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, all the entries are from Windows logs (winlog). The tasks mentioned are either \"File created\" or \"Dns query\". Looking at the processes involved: there's a lot of activity from \"SDXHelper.exe\" and some from \"EXCEL.EXE\".\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE events are making DNS queries. That could be normal if Excel is trying to connect to online services, maybe for data updates or cloud features. But it's worth noting how many times this happens. There are two instances of DNS queries from Excel.\n\nNow, focusing on SDXHelper.exe: this process is creating a lot of files in the OfflineFiles directory under different language-specific folders like cs-cz, cy-gb, etc. The filenames seem to be JavaScript files related to various features like transcription strings and vendor files. This could indicate that SDXHelper is part of an application (maybe Office?) downloading or caching these resources for offline use.\n\nI wonder why there are so many file creation events from the same process in quick succession. It might just be normal operation, especially if the user has multiple language packs installed or uses different features. But it's also possible that this could be part of a malicious activity, like dropping files as part of an attack.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. I recall that Microsoft Office sometimes uses such helpers for background tasks. If that's the case, then these file creations are probably normal. But if it's not recognized, or if there's an unusual pattern in file access times or sizes, it could be suspicious.\n\nThe fact that all events are either File Created or DNS Query makes me think of a potential data exfiltration or command and control activity. Malware often uses DNS queries to communicate with their servers, and creating files could be part of data collection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps, user activity, or other log entries indicating unusual behavior around these events, it's hard to definitively say if this is malicious. If this pattern continues, especially with a high volume or unexpected filenames, it might warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits file creation and DNS query activities primarily involving \"SDXHelper.exe\" and \"EXCEL.EXE\". The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe in the OfflineFiles directory suggest potential legitimate caching for an application like Microsoft Office, given the language-specific files. However, the volume of these events could indicate suspicious activity, such as data exfiltration or command and control communication.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes Involved**: The processes are \"SDXHelper.exe\" (frequent) and \"EXCEL.EXE\" (occasional).\n2. **Analyze Task Types**: Tasks include \"File created\" and \"Dns query\".\n3. **Assess Event Frequency**: Multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe within a short period.\n4. **Consider Legitimacy**: If SDXHelper.exe is part of a known legitimate application, these events may be normal.\n5. **Evaluate Suspicious Indicators**: High volume and specific filenames could hint at malicious activity, especially if not aligned with user actions.\n6. **Determine Need for Investigation**: Further analysis, including timestamps and other logs, would help confirm whether this activity is unusual or concerning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the activities may be part of legitimate operations, the volume and nature of file creations by \"SDXHelper.exe\" could warrant closer monitoring to ensure there's no underlying malicious intent."}

The naming pattern seems consistent across all events, so it doesn't look random or malicious.\n\nThe process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't immediately recognizable as a known malware tool to me. I should check if it's commonly associated with legitimate applications. A quick search shows that SDXHelper is often related to software distribution and package management tools, which makes sense given the context of these files being part of a package.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the user's own AppData directory, which is typical for application data storage. The fact that each event is just creating a file without any unusual access rights or modifications also points towards normal application behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of tampering with system files or executables here; it's purely about creating resource files in a standard location.

So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, each line is a JSON object representing an event. The task is to analyze all these events together and decide whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because if multiple events are coming from the same process, it might indicate something malicious or at least suspicious activity. But I'm not entirely sure what SDXHelper.exe does. Maybe it's a legitimate system tool? I should check that.\n\nNext, each event has a task category of \"Process Creation\" and an event ID 1, which usually signifies a standard process creation event. The target is always \"\\Device\\HarddiskVolume1\", so it's writing to the same volume. The file paths in the data field are all pointing to different locations within \"%ProgramData%\", which is a common directory for storing application data. \n\nLooking at the file names, they end with .json and have prefixes like \"fil-ph-ui-strings-json\" or \"fr-fr-ui-strings-json\". These look like language-specific string files, possibly used by applications for localization. So, maybe SDXHelper.exe is part of an application that's installing or updating its language resources.\n\nWait, each file path has a unique GUID-like identifier in the middle, which suggests they are temporary or unique files being created during some process. Also, I notice that many events have the same file path but different instances, like two entries for \"fil-ph-ui-strings-json...\" and \"fr-ca-ui-strings-json...\". This repetition makes me think it's part of a loop or a批量操作.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple writes to the same volume from the same process, creating many small JSON files. This behavior could be normal for an application updating its resources, but it might also be indicative of something malicious, like file injection or persistence mechanisms. The use of GUIDs and multiple language files makes me wonder if this is part of a broader installation process.\n\nBut wait, SDXHelper.exe—does that ring any bells? I think it's related to the Shadow Defender software, which is known for system protection. If that's the case, then these events might be legitimate backups or updates by the security software. However, since I'm not entirely sure about its exact behavior, I should verify.\n\nIf this were malicious, I'd expect more varied file operations or attempts to execute code. But in these logs, it's just creating files. The repetition could also be a sign of testing or logging done by the application itself.\n\nAnother angle: multiple writes to the same directory might indicate an attempt to flood the system with files, possibly causing issues like filling up the disk space or overwhelming file systems, which is a tactic in some attacks. But without more context on the system's state, it's hard to say.\n\nIn summary, while the events look suspicious because of the repeated process name and multiple writes, they might be legitimate if SDXHelper.exe is part of a known application doing resource installations. However, given the uncertainty around what SDXHelper.exe does exactly, especially without knowing its reputation, I'm leaning towards flagging this batch as potentially interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events should be considered **interesting** for investigation due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Repetitive Process Name**: All events originate from \"SDXHelper.exe\", which could indicate suspicious or malicious activity if it's not a known legitimate process.\n\n2. **Multiple File Creations**: The repetitive creation of multiple JSON files, especially with GUID-like identifiers and language-specific naming, suggests potential file injection or resource manipulation.\n\n3. **Unknown Process Behavior**: Without definitive knowledge about the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe (potentially linked to malicious activities), these events warrant closer examination.\n\n**Conclusion**: Given the above factors, this batch of events merits further investigation to determine if they are part of a legitimate process or indicative of malicious activity."}

Each event seems to be related to some activity on the system.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the first event is from \"SDXHelper.exe\". It mentions a file creation task, specifically creating a file located at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\ko-kr-ui-strings-json_[hash].js\". That looks like it's part of the Microsoft Office setup or updates. The filename includes 'ko-kr', which is Korean, so maybe this is related to language pack installation or update.\n\nThen, from the second event onwards, there are 25 events all coming from \"EXCEL.EXE\" and they're all about setting registry values. That seems a bit unusual because Excel typically doesn't make that many registry changes in quick succession unless something specific is happening, like an add-in being installed or some configuration updates.\n\nI need to consider the context here. If this was during an Office update or installation, multiple registry writes could be normal as part of the setup process. But 25 events from Excel alone might be a red flag. Registry modifications can be malicious activities because attackers often use them to persistence their tools or modify system configurations.\n\nLooking deeper, each event is exactly the same except for the timestamp and possibly other non-visible fields. This repetition could indicate an automated process, which might not be suspicious if it's part of legitimate software behavior during installation or updates. However, given that it's 25 times from Excel, which isn't known for frequent registry writes during normal operation, I'm leaning towards this being potentially malicious.\n\nAnother angle is considering whether these events could be part of a script or tool designed to modify the system configuration en masse. Attackers might use such patterns to ensure persistence across reboots or to deploy components. The combination with the file creation event from SDXHelper.exe makes me think that maybe an Office-related component was updated, but the high number of registry writes could be suspicious.\n\nI should also check if there are any known legitimate reasons for Excel to make so many registry changes. From what I know, normal usage doesn't involve frequent writes to the registry. So this volume is definitely out of the ordinary.\n\nPutting it all together: one file creation event from a helper process and multiple registry modifications from Excel. The number of registry events stands out, suggesting possible malicious activity or an anomaly that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical Registry value set events from EXCEL.EXE may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from \"EXCEL.EXE\" where a registry value is being set. That seems normal because Excel often interacts with the Windows Registry for configuration settings. I don't immediately see anything suspicious here; it might just be part of its usual operation.\n\nThen, moving on to the events involving \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process is creating multiple files in various paths under the user's AppData directory. The file names look like JavaScript files with hashes or identifiers in their names. These could be resource files for Office add-ins or language packs since they're named things like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json\" and are located in \"OfflineFiles\" or \"dist\" directories.\n\nI'm checking if these file creation events are out of the ordinary. Since SDXHelper is an official Microsoft tool, its activities should be legitimate. The repeated file creations might be part of updating or caching resources for Office applications.\n\nThere's no indication of any malicious activity here, like files being written to unexpected locations, unusual access times, or multiple failed attempts that could indicate a breach. All events seem consistent with normal software operations, especially Microsoft-related processes.\n\nI also consider if there are any anomalies in the number of events. While it's a lot, they're all from known processes and don't show signs of being generated by malicious scripts or bots.\n\nIn conclusion, the activities described are within expected behavior for these processes. There doesn't seem to be any cause for concern or further investigation based on this log.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes Involved:**\n   - The logs include entries from `EXCEL.EXE` and `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   \n2. **Analyze Events:**\n   - `EXCEL.EXE`: Registry value set operations are typical for configuration purposes.\n   - `SDXHelper.exe`: Creates multiple JavaScript files in standard locations for Office resources.\n\n3. **Assess Normalcy:**\n   - These activities align with legitimate software behaviors, especially from Microsoft products.\n   \n4. **Check for Red Flags:**\n   - No signs of unauthorized access, strange file paths, or unusual patterns.\n\n5. **Determine Conclusion:**\n   - The events are normal and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events in the log are within normal operational ranges for legitimate software processes. There is no evidence of suspicious or malicious activities based on the provided information."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event from the system logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events are generated by \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's one process name repeating quite a bit. The task in each case is \"File created\", which means files are being written or modified on the system. The file paths all point to \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\" and then various subfolders with different language codes like \"ms-my-ui-strings-json\". It looks like these are localized string resources for Office, probably used in different languages.\n\nThere's also one event from \"Excel.exe\" where a file was created. That makes sense since Excel is an Office application, so it might be accessing the same solution packages for localization.\n\nNow, considering what I know about cybersecurity, when multiple files are being written by a single process, especially if they're part of legitimate software like Microsoft Office, it's usually not malicious. However, sometimes attackers can misuse legitimate processes to hide their activities or inject malicious code. But in this case, the file paths and names seem standard for Office components.\n\nI should also check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known process. A quick search tells me that it's related to Microsoft Office, specifically handling solution package updates or downloads. So, its activity in creating files under the SolutionPackages directory aligns with its expected behavior.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (not provided here), but assuming they're within a short period, repeated file creation could be normal during an update or installation. If these events are happening at unexpected times or in large numbers beyond usual updates, that might raise flags, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of certain files being created multiple times. Maybe it's just redundant writes, perhaps due to a script or automated process that's installing or updating localized resources for Office. Since each file has a unique name based on language codes, they're probably adding support for different languages in Office, which isn't unusual.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise (IoCs) like known malicious file hashes, domain names, or paths that would suggest these files are part of an attack. The process is signed by Microsoft if it's legitimate, but without more details, I can't be certain, but given the context, it seems safe.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to monitor such activities, especially in a corporate environment, there's no evidence here that points towards malicious intent. It looks like standard Office-related file operations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is not considered suspicious. The repeated file creation by \"SDXHelper.exe\" and \"Excel.exe\" appears to be part of normal Microsoft Office operations, specifically handling localized string resources. There are no indicators suggesting malicious activity.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events are likely legitimate and related to Microsoft Office operations. They do not indicate suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"not_suspicious\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The events involve the creation of files by 'SDXHelper.exe' and 'Excel.exe', which are associated with Microsoft Office processes. The file paths and names suggest they are localized resources, indicating normal operation rather than malicious activity.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events that the user provided. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. There are two identical events here.\n\nFirst, let's break down what each event looks like:\n\n- **Process**: The process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". I know that .exe files can be either legitimate or malicious, so the name itself doesn't immediately ring a bell as something suspicious.\n  \n- **Windows Log Task**: The task is labeled as \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". This indicates that a file was created on the system. It's a common event in logs, especially if there are many applications running or files being accessed.\n\n- **File Path**: The path provided is quite long and specific: \n  ```\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\ne-np-ui-strings-json_b754f06fbc4336a5d5ce70e8a18358e8.js\n  ```\n  This path is within the \"AppData\" folder, which is a common location for application data. It goes into Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, which suggests it's related to some Office add-in or package. The filename ends with \".js\", indicating it's a JavaScript file.\n\nNow, considering that both events are identical, this could be normal if the same file creation event happened twice, perhaps during a system restart or application reinitialization. However, since there are only two events and they're duplicates, I'm wondering if this is part of a larger sequence or if it's isolated.\n\nI should think about whether such an event is typical for a user's system. Microsoft Office packages do sometimes create files in the AppData directory, especially when installing add-ins or updating solutions. The filename seems like it could be part of a JavaScript resource used by some Office component.\n\nHowever, there are red flags to consider:\n\n1. **Duplicate Events**: While duplicates can happen, they might indicate something is being monitored or logged multiple times for no good reason, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n   \n2. **Unknown File Name**: The filename includes a long hash-like string (36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b) which might be a unique identifier for the package or resource. This part is a bit unusual, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n3. **Process Name**: \"SDXHelper.exe\" – I need to check if this is a known legitimate process. A quick mental recall doesn't bring up any known malware with this name, but it's possible that it's associated with some system tool or Office-related utility.\n\nConsidering the information, while there are elements that make me pause, like the long path and duplicate events, without additional context about other activities in the log batch, I can't definitively say this is malicious. It could just be normal file creation during an Office update or package installation.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear indication of malicious activity from the given data points alone.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show duplicate file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a typical Windows user directory, likely related to Office package resources. No signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
