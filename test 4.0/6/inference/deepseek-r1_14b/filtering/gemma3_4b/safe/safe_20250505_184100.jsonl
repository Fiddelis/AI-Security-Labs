The goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. Most of the events are related to \"Update.exe\" and \"Discord.exe\". For Update.exe, there are multiple entries where the task is \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" without any file information. Then, there are a couple of FileCreate tasks for Update.exe, creating shortcuts in different locations like the Desktop and Start Menu pointing to Discord.\n\nLooking at Discord.exe, the events show several ImageLoad tasks loading various DLL files from the Discord app directory. There's also a ProcessAccess task for Discord.exe towards the end.\n\nNow, considering what might be suspicious. The repeated ProcessAccess entries for Update.exe could indicate something, but without more context on what Update.exe is doing, it's hard to say if that's malicious. However, creating shortcuts in the Start Menu and Desktop might be part of a legitimate process, like installing or updating software.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for Discord are standard since they're loading necessary DLLs for the application to run. No unusual files or paths jump out as suspicious here.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The processes seem to be running within their normal operational parameters, with Update.exe possibly being an installer or update utility creating shortcuts and Discord just loading its required libraries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the volume of events is notable, each event on its own doesn't raise red flags. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, file modifications outside of expected operations, or other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows normal system processes with Update.exe accessing and creating files related to Discord shortcuts, along with Discord loading its necessary libraries.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of entries from processes named \"Update.exe\" and \"Discord.exe\". The tasks mentioned include things like Process accessed, File created, Registry value set, and Pipe Created.\n\nI know that Discord is a legitimate application, so some of these might be normal. But let me dig deeper.\n\nIn the first few events, Update.exe accesses files or processes. Then there's an event where Update.exe creates a file in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk. That's a shortcut file, which is common for applications to create during setup or updates. \n\nBut I also notice that after creating this file, Update.exe terminates. That seems normal if it's part of the update process.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where reg.exe is used with command lines adding registry entries under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. These look like they're setting up Discord to run at startup and associating it with a protocol handler. This is typical for applications wanting to run on startup or set up custom protocols, so that might not be suspicious.\n\nHowever, the use of reg.exe could also be a red flag because attackers sometimes modify the registry. But in this case, the commands seem legitimate as they're adding entries related to Discord's operation.\n\nThe Pipe Created events from both Update.exe and Discord.exe are common for inter-process communication, so those don't raise alarms on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows activities related to updating Discord, creating shortcuts, modifying registry settings for startup and protocol handling. While these actions could be part of a legitimate update or installation process, they might also mimic behaviors seen in malware that installs itself persistently or creates launch points.\n\nSince the events involve legitimate-looking processes but with some potentially suspicious elements like multiple registry modifications and file creation by an updater process, I'm leaning towards this being interesting. The confidence isn't very high because it's possible these are normal updates, but there's enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events of an external program (Update.exe) creating a shortcut file and modifying system processes and registry entries, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I've got a bunch of JSONL events here, all related to processes on a system. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: Discord.exe is creating a pipe. That seems normal because Discord uses pipes for inter-process communication. Next, reg.exe is being used with some command lines to modify the registry. Specifically, they're adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord and setting default icons and shell commands. That's a bit unusual but not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple events where Discord.exe accesses processes and creates pipes again. Still within normal operations for an application like Discord. The use of reg.exe continues, with another registry modification to set the command for opening files with Discord. This could be part of setting up custom behaviors or integrations, which isn't inherently suspicious.\n\nThere's a process termination event where Discord.exe stops running. That's expected when the application closes. I also see Update.exe loading some modules and creating a shortcut in the Start Menu. Creating shortcuts is standard during software installations or updates.\n\nThe file paths mentioned are all within the user's AppData and Program Files directories, which aligns with how applications typically operate. There are no signs of unusual file accesses or creations outside of expected locations for Discord and its related processes.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise like writes to unexpected registry keys, execution from temporary files, or network activities that would raise a red flag. The events seem consistent with normal operations of the Discord application, possibly during startup, updates, or configuration changes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there are several process creations and registry modifications, they don't suggest malicious behavior. They look like legitimate actions taken by Discord to run and configure itself.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal operations of the Discord application, including process creation, termination, registry modifications, and file loading.

So, I see a bunch of events here, all in JSONL format. Each line has a process, some winlog tasks, and sometimes a file.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they're all from \"Update.exe\" with task \"Process accessed\". That's repeated multiple times. Then there's an event where Update.exe creates a file: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk\". After that, it continues accessing processes and eventually terminates.\n\nThen I see Discord-related processes. There's a Dns query from Discord.exe, some pipe creations, and process terminations. Notably, there's a Process Create event for DiscordSetup.exe which then gets terminated. Also, Discord.exe is started with a specific command line that includes various parameters, annotations, and paths.\n\nI'm thinking about what could be concerning here. The creation of \"Discord.lnk\" by Update.exe seems suspicious. Shortcuts are often used in malicious activities to execute scripts or binaries on startup. The fact that it's created by an updater might not be inherently bad, but the combination with other events could raise flags.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess tasks from Update.exe could indicate something trying to gather information about running processes, maybe for lateral movement or privilege escalation. Also, the registry value sets might suggest persistence mechanisms where attackers store configuration data in the Registry so their malware can survive reboots.\n\nDiscord itself is a legitimate app, but the specific command line includes crashpad-handler and annotations that seem normal. However, sometimes malicious actors disguise their tools as parts of known apps or use them for exfiltration. The pipe creations might be communication channels between different processes, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of process creation\/termination, file creation, registry modifications, and network activities (DNS query) from different executables that don't seem to belong together. This could indicate an ongoing malicious process where an attacker is using legitimate tools in an unusual way or deploying new components.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events shows potential indicators of compromise, like file creation, registry changes, and repeated process accesses which might not be normal user activity. The confidence isn't super high (maybe 0.7) because while each event has red flags, they could also be part of legitimate updates or app behaviors, but the pattern seems concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show potential indicators of compromise including file creation, registry modifications, repeated process access, and network activities that may not align with normal user behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a Process Create task for Discord.exe with some command line arguments. This seems normal because when an application starts, especially Discord, which is known to have multiple processes and uses command-line parameters for different components.\n\nThe next few events are about process access and image loads. They all point to Discord.exe accessing various files like ffmpeg.dll, updater.node, and others. These are typical parts of the application's startup process. For instance, Discord often uses FFmpeg for video encoding, so that file makes sense.\n\nI notice there are two Process Create events with different command lines. The first one is a gpu-process, and the second is a network service. This aligns with how Discord runs multiple processes to handle different tasks, like GPU acceleration and networking. These aren't unusual; they're standard for optimizing performance in applications.\n\nThe events also show Pipe Created, which is common when creating named pipes for inter-process communication. Since Discord uses various services and modules, this is expected behavior.\n\nAnother thing I'm checking is the file paths. All the files being accessed are within the Discord application directory, under AppData. There's no indication of any external or unexpected files being loaded, which could be a red flag.\n\nI also look at the command-line arguments. They include flags like --type=gpu-process and --utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService, which again are standard for Discord's process management. The disabled features seem related to performance optimizations and resource usage, typical in applications aiming to manage system resources efficiently.\n\nThe justification provided is that these events are normal for Discord's operation, involving multiple processes and file accesses as part of its startup and functionality. So, the confidence level is high because all observed activities are consistent with known behaviors of Discord.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal process creation and image loading activities associated with the Discord application's startup processes, including GPU-related tasks and network services.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. So, there are multiple entries here, all related to Discord.exe and some other processes. \n\nFirst off, I notice that most of the events involve Discord.exe performing various tasks like file creation, process access, and pipe events. For instance, there are several \"File created\" events pointing to different .lnk files on the user's desktop and start menu. These shortcut files might be normal if the user is setting up their environment, but I should consider whether creating multiple shortcuts quickly could be suspicious.\n\nThen, there are a bunch of \"Process accessed\" tasks for Discord.exe. Accessing processes isn't inherently malicious, but repeated accesses could indicate something like privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network. However, since it's the same process accessing itself, maybe it's just part of its normal operation.\n\nLooking further, I see two events where reg.exe is used to modify the registry. Specifically, it adds a new key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with a value \"URL:Discord Protocol\". This could be setting up Discord as a protocol handler, which is standard for applications like Discord to integrate into the system's URL handling. But sometimes, malicious software also registers protocols to intercept traffic or redirect requests. So this might warrant closer investigation.\n\nAdditionally, there are pipe events where pipes are being created by Discord.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but in some cases, they can be a vector for attacks if not properly secured. The repetition of these pipe creations could be a red flag depending on the context.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions like creating files or accessing processes might seem benign, the combination here—especially the registry modification and repeated process accesses—could indicate something more nefarious. It's possible that Discord.exe is being used as part of a larger attack, such as a persistence mechanism or to execute malicious commands.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the events show multiple potentially suspicious activities that together might signal malicious behavior. However, without additional context like timestamps, user activity, or network data, it's hard to be certain. My confidence is around 0.7 because while there are red flags, they could also be normal operations for Discord on a system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a process create event for Discord.exe with some command line arguments. That seems normal because Discord is a legitimate application. The next few events are about image loads and pipe creations, which are typical when an app starts up—Discord probably uses named pipes for communication between its processes or to integrate with the system.\n\nThen I see two process create events for reg.exe. Reg.exe is a standard Windows tool used to edit the registry. The command lines show that it's adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord and setting default icons. This looks like Discord registering itself as a URL protocol handler, which is something normal apps do when they want to handle links like .discord.gg.\n\nI'm noticing a pattern here: multiple pipe creations by Discord.exe. While that might seem suspicious at first glance, it's actually common for applications to create pipes for IPC (inter-process communication). For example, Discord has separate processes for different parts of the application, and pipes are a standard way to communicate between them.\n\nLooking through all the events, they're all related to starting up the Discord application. There's nothing indicating any malicious activity like failed logins, access to unexpected files, or known bad processes. All file paths seem legitimate, pointing to where Discord is installed on the system.\n\nI also check if there are any unusual command-line arguments or registry changes beyond what's expected for a Discord setup. The reg.exe commands look standard for setting up protocol handlers and default icons. There's no indication of writing to unexpected areas of the registry or creating new entries that might be suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the number of pipe creations. While it's multiple, this isn't necessarily concerning because legitimate applications can create several pipes as part of their normal operation. Without seeing any anomalies like pipe names that look malicious or unexpected behavior after creation, I don't see a red flag here.\n\nI also consider if there are any signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement. The events don't show processes running with elevated privileges beyond what's typical for Discord. All processes are created under the user context, which is normal for GUI applications.\n\nIn summary, all these events fit within the expected behavior of a Discord client starting up and setting up its environment. There's nothing that stands out as malicious or unusual when looking at the combination of all events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal process creation, image loading, and pipe creation activities related to Discord.exe startup and legitimate system interactions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me start by understanding what each log represents.\n\nThe first log shows reg.exe being used with a command line argument that adds a value to the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. This seems like Discord is setting up a shell open command, which is standard behavior for applications to define how they handle certain file types.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of Discord.exe being created and accessed. The command line in one of these logs shows that Discord is starting with various parameters, including --type=utility and --unzipper. This looks like Discord is running a utility or unpacking files during startup, which is normal for applications needing to extract resources.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a series of Network connection detections by Discord.exe. Establishing network connections is typical for any application that needs to communicate with servers, especially Discord which relies heavily on real-time communication. The DNS queries also align with this behavior as they're likely resolving domain names for server connections.\n\nThere are entries where Discord accesses the registry and sets values. This is common during software updates or initial setup to store configuration settings. Additionally, loading image files like ffmpeg.dll and other DLLs is standard for applications that need additional functionality provided by these libraries.\n\nOne log mentions a file executable detected in a temporary folder with Google Widevine CDM.dll. While this might sound suspicious at first glance, it's likely part of Discord's process to handle multimedia decoding, as Widevine is used for digital rights management. Since this is coming from Discord.exe and happening during an unzip operation, it doesn't raise red flags immediately.\n\nI also note that there are multiple Pipe Created events and Image Load events. These are typical activities when applications start up or interact with other processes, so they don't indicate malicious behavior on their own.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the batch primarily consists of normal operations by Discord: setting registry entries, starting processes, accessing resources, establishing network connections, and loading necessary libraries. There's no evidence of unusual activity like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or unexpected file creations. The only potentially concerning point is the detection of a DLL in a temporary folder, but given the context, it seems part of Discord's legitimate operations.\n\nTherefore, while each event might look suspicious on its own, when viewed as a whole, they collectively represent standard behavior for Discord during startup and operation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to Discord.exe performing normal process creation, network connections, and resource loading.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's see. I'm given a batch of 10 JSONL events, each representing some system log entries. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first event: It shows \"Discord.exe\" as the process and mentions a network connection detected with rule NetworkConnect. The file field is null. I know Discord often connects to servers, so this might be normal. But let me check how many times this pattern repeats.\n\nThe next few events are identical—same process name and network connection task. So events 2-7 are all the same as the first one. That's six instances of Discord.exe making a network connection. It could be part of its regular operation, like connecting to different servers or peers. But why so many? Maybe it's checking multiple nodes.\n\nThen, event 8 shows \"Process terminated (rule: ProcessTerminate)\" for Discord.exe. So the process ended normally here. That seems fine unless there's a pattern of termination following connection attempts.\n\nEvent 9 has a \"Registry value set\" task. Again, this could be normal if Discord is adjusting settings or reading configuration, but it depends on whether this activity is unusual for Discord during its operation.\n\nThe last event (10) is back to a network connection detected, same as before. So overall, the logs show multiple instances of Discord making network connections, one instance where the process terminated, and another where a registry value was set.\n\nConsidering that all these events are from Discord.exe, which is a legitimate application known for its networking features, it's possible that these activities are within normal operational parameters. The repetition might indicate typical behavior during usage, such as connecting to different servers or peers frequently. There’s no evidence of failed attempts, access to unusual files, or other red flags that would suggest malicious activity.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple network connection events in a short time could be worth looking into if it's outside the usual baseline for this system. If Discord.exe is supposed to connect only once or a few times, having many connections might indicate something suspicious. But without knowing the normal behavior of Discord on this system, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe process termination and registry activity also don't stand out as malicious in themselves. They could be part of the application's lifecycle or configuration management.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are several events that together paint a picture of potentially high network activity from Discord.exe, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior.
