{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: SDXHelper.exe is loading combase.dll. That seems normal because those are system files. The same with urlmon.dll; those are part of Windows' regular operations. I notice that SDXHelper.exe repeats a few times, each time loading different DLLs but all within the System32 directory, which is standard.\n\nNext up is taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll. Taskhostw is related to task scheduling, so again, that's expected behavior. It's just doing its normal job.\n\nThen there's services.exe logging a logon event. Services.exe handles service-related tasks, and logon events are common during system startup or when services start up.\n\nThe next event has a null process name but mentions Special Logon. That might be an indication of something happening at the system level, maybe during boot or network login, which isn't necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nSDXHelper.exe again is making DNS queries. DNS lookups are pretty common for applications needing to resolve domain names, so unless it's querying something malicious, this might not be a red flag yet.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder with .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems like part of the log shipping process; maybe it's an agent setting up its configuration file. Not unusual, especially if Winlogbeat is installed on the system.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where SDXHelper.exe is making DNS queries repeatedly. This repetition could be a sign of something monitoring or checking for updates, but without context on what SDXHelper does, it's hard to say. Maybe it's part of legitimate software behavior.\n\nAnother event from svchost.exe setting a registry value. SvcHost is a common host process for system services, so registry modifications are standard during operation.\n\nExplorer.EXE also sets a registry value—probably related to shell or UI settings, which isn't concerning.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process create event. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. However, in this case, the command line just shows the default path without any arguments, so it might just be launching the shell without executing commands. But I should keep an eye on subsequent events related to this process.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe's activity: it loads several DLLs and creates a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1. This filename looks like part of PowerShell's script policy testing, which is a standard procedure to check if scripts are allowed to run. However, sometimes attackers use this exact mechanism to test if they can execute code without detection.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of legitimate activity here—system processes loading DLLs, services starting, and normal user applications doing their thing. The repeated DNS queries from SDXHelper could be part of its regular operation, maybe checking for updates or something similar. However, the powershell.exe process creating a test script file named with a pattern often seen in malicious activities raises some eyebrows. While it's possible that this is just standard testing by an admin, it's also a common tactic used in attacks to check if scripts can execute without being blocked.\n\nSo considering all these points, while most events are benign, the presence of PowerShell creating a test script file with a suspicious name makes the batch interesting for further investigation. It's not conclusive, but there's enough here to warrant looking into it more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe creating a script file with a suspicious name pattern often associated with malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell.exe deleting a file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1 in the Temp folder. That's suspicious because scripts with .ps1 are typically executed by PowerShell, and having them deleted might indicate they were run or removed to cover tracks.\n\nNext, there are several events from PowerShell.exe with tasks like \"Pipe Created\" and \"Provider Lifecycle.\" These seem normal as part of PowerShell's operation, but the repetition could be part of a script running multiple commands.\n\nThen I see HxTsr.exe accessing the registry. That might not be suspicious on its own unless it's known malware or doing something unusual.\n\nThere are also events from py.exe and python.exe, which is normal for Python environments loading modules. However, seeing both py.exe and python.exe could indicate a virtual environment or multiple scripts running, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nLooking at the combination, the PowerShell activity stands out because of the file deletion. While other events might be benign, the file delete event raises flags. Malware often uses PowerShell for execution and then cleans up traces. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks could indicate a script running in a loop or part of an automated process.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is malicious without more context, but given the file deletion by PowerShell, it's better to mark it as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from powershell.exe and python-related processes, including a File Delete event which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the first two entries are from \"python.exe\" loading DLLs. That seems normal since Python often uses such files. The next two involve winlogbeat.exe creating a file named \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". Winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so this could be it setting up or updating its configuration. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are three events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" with DNS queries. I'm not familiar with SDXHelper off the top of my head, but I'll try to recall. Maybe it's a legitimate tool for system administration? Or could it be something malicious trying to communicate with a domain?\n\nThe last event is from \"RuntimeBroker.exe\", which I know handles runtime events in Windows. The registry value set might be part of its normal operation.\n\nPutting this together, most events seem routine. The winlogbeat activity and RuntimeBroker are likely benign. However, the multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper could raise an eyebrow. If it's a legitimate tool, repeated lookups might not be unusual, but without more context, there's a slight concern about potential malicious activity.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe these events are part of standard operations, especially if the system is running updates or specific scripts that require those DLLs and configurations. The confidence level isn't very high because while some elements look suspicious, they could just be normal behavior for certain applications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple DNS queries from an unknown process (SDXHelper.exe), which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
