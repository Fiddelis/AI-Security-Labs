Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where CompatTelRunner.exe is loading AMSI.DLL and other files like taskschd.dll. That's a bit concerning because AMSI is related to antivirus scanning, but repeated instances might indicate something fishy.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other activities, it could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the user account management events, there are several entries. That makes me think about potential privilege escalations or unauthorized access attempts. Nine of these in a row is a bit suspicious—maybe an attempt to modify user accounts?\n\nThe powershell.exe command stands out because it's being executed with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted. I know that script blocks can be used for malicious activities, and even with restricted policies, certain commands might still execute. The command itself checks for specific .inf files, which could be part of a payload or configuration file.\n\nSVCHOST.EXE is involved in registry changes and process creation. Since svchost is a legitimate system process, but it's often used by malware to hide their activities, I'm keeping an eye on that.\n\nThere are also logs for Chrome and EdgeUpdate, which seem normal unless they're part of a larger pattern. The file created by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe might be an update, so probably not malicious on its own.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe is loading Defender-related files multiple times. Defender processes can vary, but repeated activity here could indicate something's off, especially if it's combined with other events.\n\nCONHOST.EXE modifying the registry adds another layer to consider. Conhost is often used by command-line tools, so combined with previous entries, it might be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of user account changes, use of restricted powershell commands, repeated loading of system files by various processes, and defender-related activities. These points could indicate either normal system activity or signs of an active attack like privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence setup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show potential user account management attempts and unusual process activity, including powershell execution with a restricted policy and repeated loading of system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I have 15 JSONL entries here. \n\nFirst, looking at each event individually: most of them are about the 'git.exe' process creating files in a node_modules directory. Specifically, it's creating several .js files related to semver (versioning). The first event is an image load for MpClient.dll by MpCmdRun.exe, which I recognize as part of Windows Defender—nothing unusual there.\n\nNext, considering the batch as a whole: seeing multiple file creation events from git.exe in the same location suggests this is part of a normal development workflow. Node modules are standard in JavaScript projects, and semver is a common package for versioning. The repeated creation might be due to installing or updating dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior like unexpected paths, unfamiliar processes, or multiple failed attempts that could indicate attacks. Everything points towards legitimate software operations. \n\nHowever, it's possible that an attacker could hide malicious activities within such a context, but without more events showing anomalies or deviations from normal patterns, there's no cause for concern here.\n\nSo, the batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation as it appears entirely normal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to a legitimate process (git.exe) creating files in a node_modules directory, indicating normal development activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

It looks normal for development environments where dependencies are being installed or when a repository is cloned, leading to the creation of various module files and their associated assets like package.json, licenses, and documentation files.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

The file paths look typical for a development environment—node_modules is standard for npm packages.\n\nEach event has the same process name and task description about file creation.

Let me look through them one by one. \n\nAll the events have the same process name: git.exe. That makes sense because when you clone a repository using Git, it's common for files to be created as part of the checkout process. Each event shows that a file was created (FileCreate task in Windows logs). The paths listed are all within a node_modules directory, which is typical for JavaScript projects where third-party libraries and modules are stored.\n\nLooking at the specific file paths, I see files like key.js, readme.md, license, package.json, etc. These are standard files you'd expect to find when installing Node.js packages. For example, package.json files define dependencies, index.d.ts might be TypeScript definitions, and readme.md is documentation. The fact that these files are being created by git.exe suggests it's part of a Git checkout or clone operation.\n\nSince all the events relate to the same user (fiddelis) and are located in their Downloads directory under a course folder (S206 - Qualidade de Software), this looks like someone setting up a project locally. It's possible they're cloning a repository that has several Node.js packages, which is why there are multiple files being created in the node_modules folder.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual file paths, access times, or other red flags like writes to system directories or creation of hidden files. All the actions seem consistent with normal development workflows involving Git and Node.js modules.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any alarms. It's more about a user setting up their development environment rather than any malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the creation of files during a Git clone or checkout operation in a Node.js project, which is normal and expected activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing a file creation by the git.exe process in Windows. The files are located under the node_modules directory within a user's Downloads folder.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events involve the same process name, git.exe, which is commonly used for version control and isn't inherently malicious. The tasks logged are all \"File created\" events triggered by the same rule, FileCreate. This suggests it's part of normal file operations rather than anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within node_modules, which is a standard directory for storing Node.js packages. The files include various .js and .json files, along with READMEs and CHANGELOGs—typical components of software modules. There are no signs of unusual filenames or extensions that might indicate malware.\n\nThe consistent repetition of the same process and task without any variation makes me think this is part of a routine operation, like installing dependencies or updating packages using npm. Since all events follow a similar pattern without any anomalies, there's little reason to suspect malicious activity here.\n\nI also consider the user context—the files are under the user's Downloads directory, which isn't unusual for development work, especially if the user is working on a project involving Node.js and Git. There's no evidence of elevated privileges or access outside the user's scope, which would be a red flag.\n\nIn summary, all events point to legitimate file creation activities during software development.

Each one shows that git.exe created a file.

This doesn't raise any immediate red flags because such activities are typical during development workflows.\n\nNext, I'll consider the batch as a whole. All three events involve the same process and similar file paths. There’s no indication of unusual patterns, like multiple writes from different processes or times that suggest tampering. The repetition might be due to Git cloning or updating the repository, which is standard.\n\nI should also think about whether these files are part of known malware. Tcomb is a library for type checking in JavaScript, so it's legitimate. Therefore, their creation by Git doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThe justification would point out that this activity is normal during development and doesn’t indicate malicious behavior.
