{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. I'll start by analyzing each event individually first.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt'. Powershell scripts can be legitimate, but they're often used in attacks too. Not sure yet, but this could be something to look into.\n\nThe second event is another powershell process accessing something. Still, nothing concrete here. The third and fourth events are chrome.exe modifying the registry. That's more normal because browsers do modify registry settings for updates or preferences. No immediate red flags here.\n\nThen there's a series of chrome processes making changes again. Maybe they're just updating settings or extensions. Not too concerning on their own.\n\nThe sixth event is another powershell process accessing the registry, which might be part of setting up some configuration. Still within possible normal operations but worth noting.\n\nNow, looking at the 7th and onward events: The command lines show that powershell.exe is executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts from various paths. That script name sounds maliciousâ€”it's likely meant to record keystrokes for persistence or stealing information. This is a big red flag. Also, the use of different file paths suggests multiple attempts or different stages of an attack.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe creates and then deletes a file (__PSScriptPolicyTest...), which might be part of script verification or to avoid detection. Additionally, the ImageLoad events for Defender DLLs could be normal operations, but combined with other malicious indicators, they might be suspicious.\n\nThe Engine Lifecycle event in one of the events is another sign that powershell's script execution is happening. This suggests active scripting, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple powershell instances running scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from various locations, along with file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, strongly indicate malicious activity. The repeated attempts to run the same type of script suggest a potential infection or attack in progress.\n\nI'm pretty confident this batch is interesting because it shows signs of possible malware activities using powershell scripts for persistence and data theft.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) across different paths, along with file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows a process named powershell.exe executing a script from \"C:\\\\tarefa_base\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\entrada_temporario\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". The task in the winlog is \"Engine Lifecycle\", which seems normal for PowerShell starting up. But I'm concerned because Get-Keystrokes sounds like it might be related to keylogging, which is malicious.\n\nThe second event has no process information but mentions executing a remote command and points to the same script path as the first event. This suggests that the script was run remotely, which could indicate an attack, especially since it's the same file mentioned earlier.\n\nLooking at the third event, winlogbeat.exe created a new config file. That seems benign; winlogbeat is likely just setting up or updating its configuration. No red flags here.\n\nThe fourth event is another powershell.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. The filename is generic, so it's hard to say if this is malicious without more context. It could be part of legitimate script execution or something else.\n\nThe fifth event shows svchost.exe creating a file in a system directory. Svchost is commonly used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. However, the filename \"keyValueLKG.dat\" doesn't immediately sound suspicious, and it's located in a standard Windows directory.\n\nPutting it all together, two events involve powershell.exe and the Get-Keystrokes script. This script's name suggests keylogging activity, which is definitely malicious. The fact that it was executed remotely adds to the suspicion. While other events don't indicate anything wrong on their own, the combination of these two could be part of a larger attack vector, possibly aiming to capture keystrokes for credentials or other sensitive information.\n\nI'm confident enough to say this batch is interesting because of the potential malicious script execution and remote command execution. However, without more context or additional events showing the aftermath (like key logs being sent out), my confidence isn't 100%. But given what's here, it's definitely worth a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes execution of a PowerShell script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which may indicate keylogging activity. Additionally, there is evidence of remote command execution and file creation activities that could be part of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
