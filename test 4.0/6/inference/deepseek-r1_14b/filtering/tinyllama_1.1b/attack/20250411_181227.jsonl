Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first six events, all of them involve powershell.exe being executed with some command-line arguments. The command lines are pretty similar, each creating a new scheduled task using Powershell. They set an action to execute calc.exe, trigger it at logon, specify the user as BUILTIN\\Administrators with high integrity level, and then register the task with different names like \"unidade_ativo\" or \"registro_geral\". This pattern makes me think that someone is trying to create multiple scheduled tasks using Powershell. Since calc.exe isn't malicious by itself, but creating a lot of scheduled tasks can be a red flag—maybe they're setting up persistence mechanisms or something more nefarious.\n\nThen, the next events are about Powershell accessing processes and registry values. Event 7 shows \"Registry value set\" and event 8 is \"Process accessed\", both related to Powershell. This could indicate that the script is modifying system configurations or accessing other processes, which might be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nEvent 9 involves Chrome.exe creating a pipe. I'm not sure if this is significant on its own, but it's worth noting that it's happening around the same time as all these Powershell activities. Maybe there's some inter-process communication going on.\n\nEvents 10 to 14 show multiple \"Image loaded\" events for different DLLs when running Powershell.exe. This is normal when any application loads libraries, so I don't think this is suspicious by itself. It could just be the standard loading of .NET framework components.\n\nEvent 15 stands out because it's a file creation event for a .ps1 script in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1\". The naming looks random, which is common for malicious scripts to avoid detection. Also, since this was created by Powershell.exe, and given the earlier activities of creating scheduled tasks, it suggests that a potentially harmful script might be executing.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of Powershell creating scheduled tasks, accessing processes and registry, and writing a new .ps1 file in Temp are all concerning. These actions don't seem to be part of normal user activity. They could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence on the system using Powershell for scripting and task scheduling.\n\nI should also consider if these events are legitimate. Sometimes, admins use Powershell for tasks, but creating multiple scheduled tasks with calc.exe as action seems unusual. Moreover, writing a script in the Temp directory is risky because it's often used by malicious actors to avoid detection.\n\nSo overall, the combination of these activities points towards potential malicious behavior that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as action and writing a script in Temp directory suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"RISK_LEVEL\": \"High\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event shows a PowerShell process deleting a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. That's already suspicious because scripts in the Temp folder might be temporary, but maybe it's just cleanup. But I'll keep this in mind.\n\nNext, there are two PowerShell processes with command lines that look like they're setting up scheduled tasks. The commands are creating tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. That definitely stands out because using PowerShell to create persistent tasks is a common technique for malware to maintain persistence. This makes me think something's off.\n\nThen, there are multiple Chrome processes modifying the registry. Each event says 'Registry value set'. While legitimate software does modify the registry, doing this repeatedly might be part of malicious activity or just regular updates. But since it's happening so often and in combination with other events, I'm concerned.\n\nLooking further, there are several events labeled as 'Execute a Remote Command' without any associated process name. This is worrying because remote command execution can indicate an active attack, like remote code execution via some vulnerability. It doesn't have context, but the sheer number makes it suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. WMI-related processes are often used in attacks for lateral movement or persistence. While this could be normal, combined with other indicators, it adds to the concern.\n\nThere's a svchost.exe modifying the registry again, which is another point of suspicion because svchost can be involved in malicious activities, especially when running scripts or changing system settings.\n\nA process named winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own directory. That seems legitimate if it's part of log shipping, but without more context, it's hard to say. And then there are multiple file creations by PowerShell and Chrome, which might be normal but could also be related to dropping malicious files or configuration changes.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple scheduled tasks created via PowerShell with admin rights, remote command executions, repeated registry modifications, and WMI activity—these all point towards potential malicious behavior. The combination of these events suggests a possible attack chain where an adversary is establishing persistence, potentially executing commands remotely, and covering their tracks by modifying system configurations.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of activities doesn't seem normal for typical user or application behavior. The high number of suspicious events across different processes (PowerShell, Chrome, svchost) is concerning. My confidence level is about 0.85 because while each event could be explained individually, their combination strongly suggests malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe with admin privileges, repeated registry modifications by Chrome, remote command executions, and WMI activity. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
