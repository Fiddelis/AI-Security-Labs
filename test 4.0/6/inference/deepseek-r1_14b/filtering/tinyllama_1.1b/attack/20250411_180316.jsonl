{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So I've got a bunch of system log events here in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should just be one classification: either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and a confidence score.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. powershell.exe setting a registry value.\n2. cmd.exe being created without any command line arguments.\n3. Another cmd.exe setting a registry value.\n4. chrome.exe loading some DLLs, which seems normal because Chrome uses various system libraries.\n\nContinuing through the list, I see multiple instances of cmd.exe and conhost.exe setting registry values. Then there's whoami.exe being executed. Powershell is showing up quite a bit—accessing processes, loading images (DLLs), and deleting a file in the Temp directory. There are also events where powershell.exe is created with an empty command line or something like \"& {}\".\n\nNow, I know that certain behaviors can be red flags for malicious activity. For example, PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts. Frequent registry modifications might indicate attempts to persistence or change system configurations. The deletion of a file in the Temp directory could be an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after some malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, not all these activities are necessarily bad. For instance, normal system processes do use registry keys and load DLLs. However, the combination here might be suspicious. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being created without any command line arguments, which seems odd because usually you'd see a script or command being executed. Also, deleting a file in the Temp directory from PowerShell could be part of some malicious script trying to clean up.\n\nI should consider if this volume and combination of events over a short period (assuming all these happened around the same time) is normal. Typically, seeing multiple process creations and registry writes without clear legitimate activity might raise concerns. Additionally, the repeated use of powershell.exe could be an indicator of command-and-control or script execution.\n\nI also notice that some events have empty command lines, which isn't typical for legitimate scripts or tools. Legitimate software usually has more descriptive command lines. The use of \"&\" in the command line for PowerShell might be trying to execute multiple commands or obfuscate what's happening.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry writes by different processes (cmd.exe and conhost.exe). These could be part of a persistence mechanism, where an attacker sets registry keys to ensure their malicious script runs at startup.\n\nThe deletion of a specific PowerShell script in the Temp directory might indicate that the script was dropped there temporarily and then removed after execution. This is common in malware to avoid detection.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple process creations with cmd.exe and powershell.exe, registry modifications, image loading (DLLs), and file deletions in the Temp directory. These collectively suggest possible malicious activity, especially since some of these actions are done repeatedly and without clear legitimate context.\n\nI think this batch is INTERESTING because of the combination of potentially malicious indicators. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context. It's possible that a user ran multiple scripts or tools that triggered these events, but given the types of activities, it's more likely to be suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creations (cmd.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe) and PowerShell activities including registry modifications, image loading, and file deletion.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this JSONL data to see if it's interesting or not. First, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the details, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check for file paths ending with .bat. These checks could be part of a malicious script trying to determine if certain files exist before proceeding. The repeated pattern suggests automation or an attempt to verify file presence across different locations.\n\nAnother point is the creation of processes like whoami.exe, which might be used to gather information about the system's user context. This tooling is common in reconnaissance phases of an attack.\n\nThe events also show Registry value sets and Image loads for legitimate DLLs. While these aren't directly malicious, they can be indicators of process injection or lateral movement techniques where attackers load malicious code into existing processes.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of repeated PowerShell activity checking for specific files and using other tools like whoami.exe indicates possible malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence or moving laterally within a network. This batch definitely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing commands that check for the existence of specific .bat files, which could indicate malicious script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. So, any PowerShell activity should always be closely monitored.\n\nLooking at the specific actions:\n\n1. **File Operations**: There are file creation and deletion events from PowerShell. Specifically, it's creating and then deleting a script in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`. This could be part of script testing or execution, which might indicate malicious activity if not authorized.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Several entries show registry values being set by both `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe`. While Chrome can make legitimate registry changes, unusual or multiple such events from PowerShell could signal configuration changes for persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **DLL Loading**: The logs mention loading various DLLs like `MpOAV.dll`, `MsCoreei.dll`, etc. Some of these are related to Windows Defender, which is normal, but others might be loaded by malicious scripts to hide or extend functionality.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation**: There's a pipe created by PowerShell, which could allow communication between processes. This is often seen in process injection techniques where attackers create named pipes for inter-process communication.\n\n5. **Command-Line Arguments**: The command lines show script execution attempts and file creation\/set-content operations. For example, `Set-Content` writes content to files, which can be used to drop malicious scripts or modify existing ones.\n\n6. **Multiple Similar Events**: There are repeated events of registry modifications by both processes, suggesting a pattern that might indicate an attempt at persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of file manipulation, registry changes, DLL loading, pipe creation, and script execution is concerning. These activities can be indicative of malicious behavior such as scripting attacks, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events should be classified as interesting due to the potential signs of unauthorized system modifications and possible attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, DLL loading, and command execution suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the first event shows a process named powershell.exe with a command line that creates two files: \"objeto_logico\\..modulo_base.objeto_padrao_script.bat\" and another .bat file in a different path. This is interesting because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when creating or modifying batch files which can execute commands.\n\nThe second event again involves powershell.exe, this time creating a file in the Temp directory with a PS1 script name. That's suspicious because temporary scripts can be used to test if certain policies are enforced, like PSScriptExecutionPolicy. This could indicate an attempt to bypass restrictions by checking if script execution is allowed.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing files and registry values, as well as loading various DLLs. These activities alone might not be malicious but when combined with the creation of .bat files that might contain harmful commands, it raises a red flag.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe is checking for the existence of specific batch files using Test-Path. This behavior could be part of an attempt to ensure certain scripts exist before proceeding, which is often a step in malicious scripting to avoid detection or ensure all components are in place.\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines with slight variations in paths suggests that this might not be random activity. The consistent use of powershell.exe across all events also points towards a potential coordinated effort, possibly indicating an attempt to drop or execute scripts that could be harmful.\n\nConsidering the overall pattern—multiple file creations, registry access, and repeated checks for script existence—it seems like the system is undergoing activities that are indicative of malicious behavior. The fact that these events are spread across different parts of the filesystem and involve multiple components (like temp files and registry) makes it more concerning.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all the events together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows signs of potentially malicious activity using powershell.exe to create and check for script files, which could be part of an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe creating and checking for script files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's likely part of the log management setup. No red flags here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be something to look into further, but on its own, it might not be suspicious yet.\n\nThen, whoami.exe runs with no arguments. Whoami is often used by scripts or tools to get system information. It's generally benign unless part of a larger attack chain. Still, I'll keep an eye out for other events related to this process.\n\nThe next few entries are PowerShell commands checking if certain files exist and exiting based on that. This seems like some form of script validation. However, the paths mentioned (like C:\\objeto_principal\\...) look suspiciously similar across multiple events, suggesting a potential pattern or repeated attempts which might indicate malicious intent.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including .NET framework components and Windows Defender files. While this is common for PowerShell scripts, the combination with other activities could be significant.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event and multiple Registry value sets. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is another point of interest since attackers might use them to hide command-line arguments or exfiltrate data. The registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nAdditionally, there are repeated FileCreate tasks from powershell.exe creating files in the user's AppData and Temp directories. Creating temporary files isn't unusual, but the specific filenames (like __PSScriptPolicyTest...) suggest they might be related to script execution policies, which attackers could manipulate to bypass restrictions.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands with complex paths, checking for file existence, creating new files in sensitive locations, loading various DLLs, and modifying registry entries. These behaviors collectively look like an attacker testing the environment, attempting to establish persistence, or deploying malicious scripts. The repetitive patterns across different events also suggest a coordinated effort rather than random activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING due to the combination of these suspicious activities that don't appear to be part of normal system operations. My confidence is around 0.75 because while each event individually might not be malicious, together they indicate potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show file creation attempts and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or used. PowerShell can be malicious, but sometimes it's just regular usage. However, the command lines here might give clues. For example, some commands check if certain files exist using Test-Path and exit with 0 or 1 based on that. That seems a bit unusual because why would they be checking file existence so many times?\n\nAlso, I notice several instances of whoami.exe being run. Whoami is often used to get system information, but when combined with other processes like powershell.exe, it could indicate something suspicious, especially if there's an attempt to elevate privileges or gather info for lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the events, there are Process Create and Process Access tasks for these executables, which are normal. But the frequency of these events is high, which might be a red flag. Additionally, powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll could indicate script execution or potentially malicious activities since PowerShell often uses these for runtime environments.\n\nAnother thing is that all these processes don't seem to have any associated file paths beyond their command lines. The lack of file access events might mean they're not writing or reading files, but in some cases, especially with scripts, they might be using memory-based attacks which are harder to detect.\n\nI'm a bit concerned because the repetitive checks for specific files could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security measures or test if specific tools are present. This kind of behavior is often seen in attack chains where adversaries check for presence before deploying more substantial payloads.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event might not be malicious on its own, the combination of multiple powershell.exe invocations with file checks and whoami.exe executions could indicate a potential malicious activity or at least a high level of user privilege escalation attempts. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing files and processes, along with whoami.exe executions, suggest potential malicious activity or privilege checks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break down what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is running with specific command lines. Each time, it checks if a particular .ps1 file exists in different paths. For example, one event checks \"C:\\estrutura_temporario\\entrada_ativo\\tarefa_base\\src\\elemento_base.cs\" and exits based on whether it's present. This repeated checking of various script locations is suspicious because attackers often use such scripts to execute malicious code.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe loads different DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. Legitimate PowerShell usage might involve loading these, but the combination with other actions could indicate something's amiss. Additionally, I notice that some files are created and then immediately deleted, such as \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\" which is both created and later deleted. This behavior can be a red flag for file-based persistence mechanisms or attempts to bypass logging.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe is also notable. While it's a common tool for checking user information, its execution in the context of these PowerShell processes could be part of an attack chain to gather system information or elevate privileges.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated attempts to access specific script files across different directories, coupled with file creation and deletion activities, suggest potential malicious behavior. The overall pattern doesn't align with typical user activity but rather resembles a script testing or deployment process that's attempting to execute commands in a stealthy manner.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of PowerShell processes checking for the existence of a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths. That script name sounds suspicious because it implies keylogging, which is often malicious. The fact that they're using 'Test-Path' to check if this file exists could mean someone is trying to see if their malicious script is present or not.\n\nThen there are events from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is typically used for collecting Windows logs, so maybe it's part of a legitimate setup, but the path mentioned in the first event seems a bit off with temporary folders and \"elemento_logico,\" which doesn't look standard.\n\nNext, I see multiple instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values. SvcHost is usually a legitimate process that hosts system services, but it's also commonly used by malware because many services run under its name. Unusual registry activity could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThere are several network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. While Chrome connecting to networks is normal, multiple such events might not be suspicious on their own. However, when combined with the other activities, it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, I notice that powershell.exe is accessing various system files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. PowerShell scripts often load these DLLs for execution, but if they're part of a malicious payload, this could be a sign of something more serious.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple attempts to check for a potentially malicious script, suspicious file operations by winlogbeat.exe, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and network activities.

That's a big red flag because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. Malware often uses it to hide its actions or execute commands.\n\nLooking deeper, some of the events show file deletions, like \"File Delete logged.\" That could be an attempt to cover tracks by deleting logs or evidence. There are also pipe creations, which might be a way to establish communication between processes for malicious purposes.\n\nThe command line in several events has powershell.exe with commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse.' These look suspicious because recursively listing directories can be part of data gathering or lateral movement within a network. The fact that this is repeated multiple times suggests it might be part of a larger script running different modules.\n\nThere are file creations and deletions, including a temporary .ps1 file which could be malicious scripts being executed. Also, accessing the Windows Defender DLL (MpClient.dll) might indicate an attempt to disable or manipulate antivirus software, a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAnother point is the event where a new configuration file (.winlogbeat.yml.new) was created by winlogbeat.exe. While this seems benign, it's worth checking if it's part of legitimate activity or if it's being used maliciously to alter logging behavior.\n\nThe registry access and process access events could be indicators of lateral movement or privilege escalation. Attackers often use such actions to spread within a network or escalate their privileges.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated powershell.exe usage with potentially malicious command patterns, file operations that suggest evidence tampering, and attempts to manipulate system processes are significant red flags.
