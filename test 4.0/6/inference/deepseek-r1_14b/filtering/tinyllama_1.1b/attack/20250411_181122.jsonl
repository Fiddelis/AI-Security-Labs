{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. Specifically, there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' with command lines that include strings like \"findstr\" and \"select-string\". These commands often look for patterns in files, which might be malicious if they're searching for sensitive information like passwords.\n\nOne event shows a file being created by PowerShell: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1\". Temporary script creation can indicate script execution or testing, which is often part of malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events related to DLLs. While legitimate software loads images, some DLLs might be malicious or used for persistence. The paths like \"Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\" and \"Windows Defender Platform\" seem normal, but others could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at other processes: 'svchost.exe' modifying the registry is common for services, but sometimes malware uses it. 'OfficeClickToRun.exe' querying DNS seems benign unless it's part of a command-and-control setup. The repeated Engine Lifecycle events in PowerShell might indicate script execution or module loading, which could be malicious if they're exfiltrating data.\n\nMultiple Registry value sets across different processes like 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe', 'Calculator.exe', and 'chrome.exe' catching registry changes is interesting. These changes could be for persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations.\n\nThe high number of events related to PowerShell scripting, especially the command lines with password searches and file creations, raises red flags. These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior, suggesting potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts searching for sensitive information (passwords) in various file types, along with the creation of temporary script files and DLL loading activities. These actions are indicative of possible unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this query. The user provided a JSONL batch of events and is asking for a classification as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" They also want a concise justification and confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first few events: Chrome.exe is involved in DNS queries and loading system files like amsi.dll. That's normal for a browser, so nothing suspicious there initially. But then, winlogbeat.exe creating files seems routine too.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe creates files with names like .winlogbeat.yml.new and others ending with .txt. Creating text files isn't unusual on its own, but it's worth noting since PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be a vector for attacks.\n\nThen there are several instances of network connections from chrome.exe. While that could be normal browsing activity, multiple connections might warrant closer look, especially if they're to unexpected domains.\n\nThe cmd.exe process runs schtasks commands to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks can be legitimate admin work but also part of malicious activities like removing traces or preventing analysis tools from running. This is a red flag because it's a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\nschtasks.exe is used to create processes, and the command lines show attempts to delete specific task names. These task names have patterns like \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon,\" which seem arbitrary but could indicate an attempt to remove scheduled tasks that might be monitoring or defense mechanisms.\n\nThere's also a WMIC.exe process where it tries to delete notepad.exe processes. Using WMIC for deleting processes can be malicious, as it's often used in remote attacks to terminate legitimate tools like antivirus or logging software.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity. Cmd and schtasks are being used to delete system tasks, which is concerning. WMIC's involvement adds another layer of suspicion. While some events could be benign admin tasks, the combination—especially the repeated use of deletion commands across different processes—isn't typical normal behavior. This indicates possible attack patterns aiming to disrupt system defenses or cover tracks.\n\nTherefore, classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence makes sense because the activities point towards potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potentially suspicious activity, including repeated network connections from chrome.exe, creation of files by powershell.exe, deletion of system tasks via cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, and use of WMIC.exe to load images. These activities suggest possible malicious behavior or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system events. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe. These are common tools for administrators but can also be used maliciously. The tasks include registry changes and process creations, which could indicate some kind of activity modifying system settings or running scripts.\n\nLooking at the events, multiple instances show \"Registry value set\" tasks from both cmd.exe and powershell.exe. That's interesting because attackers often modify the Windows Registry to persistence their malware or change system configurations. The frequency of these events might be a red flag.\n\nThere are also several \"Process Create\" events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe, which could be legitimate but in this context, combined with other activities, they might indicate malicious behavior. Additionally, I see a file deletion event by cmd.exe targeting 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe' in the Temp folder. Deleting files, especially from temporary directories, can be part of an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after executing malicious code.\n\nThe presence of powershell.exe being accessed multiple times without clear justification is concerning. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement within networks. The fact that some entries have empty 'process' fields but log tasks like \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" might indicate attempts to elevate privileges or modify user accounts.\n\nMoreover, there are events where the command line is 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems unusual. This could be an attempt to execute powershell in a way that's not typical, possibly evading certain detection mechanisms or executing arbitrary commands.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activities: registry modifications, process creations for suspicious tools, file deletions, and atypical powershell executions. These patterns are consistent with behaviors observed in cyberattacks aimed at establishing persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe performing registry modifications, process creations, and file deletions, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or evidence cleanup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe with various tasks like Process Create and Image Load. I know that PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated instances could be a red flag. However, seeing it load normal DLLs might just be standard behavior.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. Whoami is usually harmless, but running it repeatedly without a clear reason might indicate someone trying to gather information about the system, which could be part of reconnaissance for an attack.\n\nNotepad.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe also show up. Notepad is commonly used and usually not suspicious on its own. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows' User Profile Service, so seeing it here isn't unusual unless there's something else indicating malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks: Process Create, Registry value set, Image Load, and others like Pipe Created. Some of these are normal for processes to interact with the system, but repeated or unusual registry changes could be concerning.\n\nI notice that many events don't have a file path specified as \"None,\" which might mean they're just process-related without file access. But the ones that do load specific DLLs (like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll) are part of .NET framework, so that's expected from PowerShell.\n\nThe repeated Process Create for whoami.exe is interesting. It's creating a lot of processes quickly, which might be an attempt to evade detection or could indicate privilege escalation if there's injection happening. But without additional info on command lines or other indicators, it's hard to say.\n\nOverall, while some activities are normal, the combination of multiple process creations for whoami and powershell.exe along with registry changes might warrant further investigation. There's a potential that these actions are part of an attack chain, like initial access or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell and whoami.exe executions along with registry modifications may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is from Calculator.exe, which loaded the urlmon.dll file. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard Windows application and urlmon.dll is part of the Windows System32 directory; it's related to URL handling. No red flags here.\n\nNext, svchost.exe set a registry value. Svchost.exe is commonly used by system services, so this activity could be legitimate. However, malicious processes sometimes use svchost as a disguise, but without more context like the exact key being modified or unusual access times, it's hard to say. I'll keep an eye on this.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup for log management, so this makes sense. The creation of a YAML configuration file seems standard for such tools. No issues here.\n\nPowershell.exe accessed something without any associated file. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. However, the event just says \"Process accessed\" with no specific action or target file. Without more details, it's hard to determine if this is suspicious.\n\nMultiple events from chrome.exe show DNS queries and network connections. Chrome making DNS queries and establishing connections is normal, especially for web browsing. Unless these are to known malicious domains or there's an unusual volume of requests, this doesn't raise a red flag. But seeing multiple network connect events could indicate some activity worth monitoring if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting all the events together: There's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The svchost.exe modifying the registry without more context is a bit concerning, but nothing definitively malicious stands out. The batch doesn't show any clear signs of a breach or attack, but there are a few points that could be worth looking into with additional logs or analysis.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually most events seem normal, and without more context or evidence of malicious intent, it's hard to justify an investigation. However, the confidence isn't super high (maybe 0.2) because I can see how someone might consider those points as potential red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal system activities such as process execution, file operations, and network connections typical of legitimate applications like Calculator.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, PowerShell.exe, and Chrome.exe. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or unusual deviations from expected activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
