That seems normal for updates or installations, so probably not malicious.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll. AMSI is related to antivirus, so this is standard behavior.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating a pipe. Creating pipes isn't inherently bad, but I should keep an eye on what it's doing next.\n\nServices.exe logging on and user account management events are common during system startup or service activity.\n\nThe command line for powershell.exe caught my attention because it's using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which is safer, and the script checks for .inf files. This might be a legitimate check, but sometimes attackers use scripts to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother event where setup.exe creates a file in the PowerShell startup profile directory. That could allow persistence, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe making DNS queries and registry changes – these are typical behaviors, nothing suspicious here.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file is part of its data collection process; no issues there.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a temp file is normal during updates.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe and MpClient.dll loading are related to Windows Defender. They're legitimate processes checking for threats.\n\nI don't see any clear signs of malicious activity across the batch, but the PowerShell command line and setup.exe actions are areas that need closer inspection because they could be used for persistence or privilege escalation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events related to potentially suspicious file operations by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and activities involving powershell.exe with an execution policy set to 'Restricted'.

Git is often used for version control in development environments, so creating multiple files during a clone or checkout is typical. The presence of .js files, LICENSEs, README.md, etc., are standard for npm packages.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\\", which suggests this is part of a Node.js project setup. It's common for Node modules to be created during installations or updates.\n\nI check if there's anything unusual about these events collectively.

It looks like git.exe is cloning or installing these modules into the project directory.\n\nSince all events are related to the normal operation of a development tool (git) setting up a node_modules folder with standard files, there's nothing unusual here.

All the files being created are under the node_modules folder in a user's directory. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all related to modules like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, etc. These seem to be standard Node.js packages that you'd expect when setting up or updating a project with npm.\n\nSince all events involve git.exe and are creating files within node_modules, this looks like someone is cloning or initializing a repository and installing dependencies. There's nothing unusual here; it's typical behavior for developers using Git and npm.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity like access to sensitive files, failed login attempts, or unexpected processes.

Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nEach line has a process named \"git.exe\". The winlog task is \"File created\", and the file paths are all under a node_modules directory. Specifically, it's creating files in \"supports-color\" and \"tcomb-validation\" folders, as well as others under \"tcomb\".\n\nHmm, git.exe is often used for version control, so when I see it creating files in node_modules, that makes me think of installing or updating npm packages. This seems normal during development work.\n\nThe paths are all within a user's Downloads folder, which might be where someone is working on a project. The specific files created include package.json and various .js files, which aligns with how npm works when installing dependencies—unpacking the necessary files into node_modules.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. All the events are from the same process, git.exe, and each one is a file creation event in Windows. The files being created are all located under the node_modules directory of a project called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". These files have names like extend.js, fail.js, forbidNewOperator.js, etc., which seem to be part of a Node.js module named tcomb.\n\nAt first glance, I might think that these events are normal because git.exe is typically associated with version control and often runs during development. The creation of JavaScript files in node_modules is standard when installing or updating dependencies. So it could just be part of the build process or a developer's routine activity.\n\nBut wait, why are multiple file creation events happening at the same time? Usually, when you install modules using npm, it does create several files in one go, especially if tcomb has multiple sub-modules or scripts. However, I also need to consider the context—could this be part of a malicious script that's dropping files as part of an attack?\n\nLooking deeper, all events are from git.exe, which might not be typical for installing npm packages since npm usually runs under node.exe. This makes me a bit suspicious because it's unusual for git to create multiple JavaScript files in a module directory unless perhaps during some automated process or if the repository is being cloned or synced.\n\nAnother angle: maybe this is related to a build step that uses git, like pulling from a remote repository as part of CI\/CD. If the project is using Git for version control and during the build process it clones or fetches repositories, these file creations could be legitimate.\n\nHowever, considering the exact paths and filenames, I recall that some malicious activities might drop files with .js extensions in such directories to avoid detection. So while on the surface it looks normal, there's a slight chance of something fishy, especially if this activity occurs outside of expected build or deployment times.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because these events are likely part of standard development or CI\/CD processes. But I can't rule out all possibilities without more context. The confidence isn't too high (maybe 0.7) because while it's mostly normal, there's a small chance of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation during the setup or update of Node.js modules by git.exe, which is part of standard development processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
