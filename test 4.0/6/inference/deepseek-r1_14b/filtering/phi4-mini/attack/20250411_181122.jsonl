{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the batch of events provided is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process named \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal because whoami is a common tool used to display user information. But then, the next few events all involve powershell.exe. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used by attackers for scripting and command execution.\n\nIn some of these events, powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various images. That's part of normal operation for scripts, but I notice that there are multiple \"Registry value set\" tasks. That might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms, which could be malicious.\n\nThere's a file creation event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1. Then it gets deleted immediately. Creating and deleting temporary scripts can be a way to avoid detection, often seen in malware. The fact that it's created and then deleted might suggest an attempt to evade logging or analysis.\n\nAlso, several events show powershell.exe using command lines with findstr and select-string commands looking for the word \"pass\" in various file types. That looks like password harvesting activity. Attackers often use such scripts to search for sensitive information like passwords stored in files.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks related to powershell.exe. These could be part of legitimate script execution but repeated instances might indicate something more nefarious, possibly a persistence mechanism or repeated attempts to execute malicious code.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating\/deleting temporary scripts, searching for passwords, and repeated provider lifecycle events suggests this batch is indicative of potential malicious activity. Therefore, it's definitely interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, and searching for sensitive information like passwords.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any unusual activity here could be a red flag. Looking at the command lines, I see that it's running some findstr commands searching for keywords like 'pass' in various file types. This seems suspicious because an attacker might look for sensitive information.\n\nNext, there are several Registry value set events from different processes including svchost.exe and chrome.exe. While svchost is a legitimate Windows process, it can sometimes be used maliciously to hide activities. The repeated registry changes could indicate persistence mechanisms being set up by malware.\n\nI also notice that the same command line appears twice for powershell.exe, which suggests it's part of a loop or script execution. This repetition might be an attempt to avoid detection or carry out multiple actions without user intervention.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where processes like findstr.exe and conhost.exe are accessing registry keys, which could be part of the malicious activity chain. The fact that these are legitimate tools being used in a potentially harmful context increases the concern.\n\nThe justification for classifying this as interesting is the combination of suspicious powershell commands searching for sensitive data, repeated registry modifications by multiple processes, and potential persistence mechanisms. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious PowerShell activity searching for sensitive terms, combined with registry modifications that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events where each line represents an event with process info, Windows log task, and file details.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are from chrome.exe doing various things like DNS queries, registry changes, loading images, and making network connections. These activities seem pretty standard for a browser. Chrome often accesses the registry to store settings, connects to networks for browsing, and loads DLLs for functionality. The fact that there are multiple such events might just be normal usage.\n\nThere are also some entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack used for log management. Its actions here, like file creation in its data directory, seem benign and related to log shipping or processing.\n\nThen I spot a few powershell.exe events. One creates a file named 'objeto_logico.txt' and another 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. These filenames are in Portuguese, which might indicate they're created by someone speaking that language, but not necessarily malicious. However, powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused. The task includes FileCreate and RegistryEvent actions. While these could be part of normal operations, the combination with process access events might raise some flags.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe execution which is typically harmlessâ€”it just outputs user information. But in some cases, it can be used by attackers to gather info during an initial access phase.\n\nPutting this together: The majority of events are normal user activities. Chrome's behavior and the log shipping tool actions don't seem suspicious. However, the powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes might warrant closer look. Additionally, the whoami.exe could be part of an attack chain or just a legitimate system check.\n\nSo, is this batch interesting? While not all events are malicious, there are elements that merit attention. The use of powershell for file creation and process access, along with whoami, could indicate possible malicious activity, but it's also common in many environments. I'm leaning towards INTERESTING because of the potential indicators, but not entirely sure.\n\nI'd give a confidence level around 0.7 because there are some red flags but they might be part of normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from chrome.exe performing registry modifications and network connections, which could indicate malicious activity. Additionally, powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes, along with whoami.exe execution, raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. There are 20 events here.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's cmd.exe executing schtasks commands to delete specific tasks. Schtasks is a legitimate Windows command for managing scheduled tasks. However, deleting tasks can be part of malicious activities like persistence removal or process disruption. This could indicate someone trying to remove traces or disable certain functionalities.\n\nThe second event involves powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute commands. The 'ProcessAccess' task might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events involving powershell, it could raise a flag.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe again, this time setting a registry value. Registry modifications are common in malware for persistence or configuration changes. Without context, this alone isn't concerning, but multiple such events might suggest something more.\n\nFourth and fifth events involve schtasks.exe being created and loading taskschd.dll. Schtasks is standard, but creating new processes without clear purpose could be suspicious, especially if combined with other activities like deleting tasks.\n\nThe next few events (6-9) show svchost.exe accessing the registry and schtasks.exe again. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be abused by malware to hide activities. Registry modifications here might indicate an attempt to alter system settings or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nEvent 10: conhost.exe modifying the registry. Conhost is part of Windows for console services; it's usually benign, but again, multiple such events could signal something amiss.\n\nEvents 11-15 involve powershell.exe accessed and a registry change. Powershell being used alongside cmd and schtasks might be part of an attack chain, like script execution or command injection.\n\nEvent 16: cmd.exe deleting notepad.exe processes. Notepad is harmless, but using wmic to delete processes could indicate attempts to terminate legitimate tools that might log malicious activities. Alternatively, it might just be a user trying to close running apps.\n\nEvents 17-20 involve WMIC.exe executing commands and loading various DLLs. WMIC can be used for remote command execution, which is often part of attacks. The fact that multiple WMIC events occur, each loading different DLLs, suggests potential exploitation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances of legitimate tools (cmd, powershell, schtasks, svchost, conhost, WMIC) being used in ways that could be malicious. Activities include deleting scheduled tasks, accessing and modifying the registry, and using WMIC for potentially remote commands. These actions, when seen together, can indicate a possible attack where an adversary is attempting to remove traces, gain persistence, or execute arbitrary commands.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of these tools and activities aligns with known tactics in cyberattacks, such as system disruption, persistence, and privilege escalation. While individual events might not be suspicious, the cumulative effect suggests a coordinated malicious effort.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of legitimate tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, schtasks.exe) being used for potentially malicious activities such as deleting scheduled tasks and modifying registry values.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and some registry changes. Plus, there are several commands using net.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe to delete user accounts.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of logs to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where cmd.exe is being used with commands like deleting services and files. For example, the command line \"\/c sc delete win32times\" suggests someone is trying to stop a service. Then, there's another cmd.exe process deleting files in the Temp directory. That's a bit suspicious because deleting files, especially from the Temp folder, could be part of cleaning up after malicious activity.\n\nNext, I notice several entries for PowerShell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. Registry modifications are common in attacks to maintain persistence or change system configurations. The fact that multiple PowerShell instances are accessing different parts of the registry is a red flag. Also, there's one entry where PowerShell is set to exit with an error code 0, which sometimes indicates malicious scripts trying to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at services.exe entries, they're modifying the registry as well. Services.exe is part of Windows and usually handles service-related tasks, so unexpected registry changes here could be signs of tampering.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running. While legitimate users might use this to check permissions, attackers can also use it for reconnaissance to see what user they're operating under, which is part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the repeated command_line entries with powershell.exe & {}. This seems unusual because it's a way to invoke PowerShell without any actual command. Sometimes attackers do this to bypass certain security filters or to set up persistence mechanisms, especially since they're using Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks, which can be indicators of script execution.\n\nPutting all these together: cmd.exe deleting services, files in Temp folder; multiple PowerShell accesses and registry edits; whoami for user info; repeated PowerShell executions that seem too generic. These activities don't look like normal user behavior. They align with common tactics used in cyberattacksâ€”like service disruption, file deletion to cover tracks, persistence via the registry, and using built-in tools like PowerShell for execution.\n\nI'm also thinking about possible attack types. The combination of deleting services, modifying the registry, and deleting files suggests potential system compromise, maybe leading up to a data exfiltration or installing backdoors. The repeated use of cmd.exe and PowerShell without clear benign purposes adds to the concern.\n\nThere are no file accesses beyond deletions, which makes me think that perhaps an attack is in progress or being set up. The lack of any legitimate activity context (like user logins or application startups) during these events further raises suspicion.\n\nIn terms of confidence, while some of these actions could theoretically be part of system administration tasks, the volume and combination make it unlikely. It's more probable that an attacker is using these tools for malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including service deletion, file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell executions, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few entries are all related to powershell.exe. It starts with a process create event for powershell.exe, then there's an access event, followed by a registry value set and image load events. This seems normal since PowerShell is a common tool, but I should keep an eye out for any unusual activities.\n\nNext, I see a file creation of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1' in the Temporary folder. That's a bit concerning because script files created in temp directories can sometimes be used for malicious purposes. However, PowerShell does use such scripts for policy testing, so it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a file delete event for that same script. This could indicate cleanup after execution, but again, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. \n\nThere are multiple image load events for various DLLs and other legitimate files like MpClient.dll. These seem normal as part of PowerShell's operation.\n\nI notice several instances where the process is being accessed, which could be routine access checks or perhaps something more nefarious trying to hide its tracks. It's a bit hard to tell without knowing what processes are accessing each other in this context.\n\nLooking further down, there's a 'whoami.exe' process create event with a command line that looks standard. It doesn't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nAnother entry is from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That's expected behavior for an agent collecting logs.\n\nThe repetition of powershell.exe accesses and whoami.exe creations stands out. Repeated attempts to access the same process or create new instances could indicate someone probing the system, perhaps trying to escalate privileges or gather information.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple interactions with PowerShell, including script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated process accesses, coupled with whoami.exe being used potentially as a low-footprint tool. While not conclusive on their own, these activities collectively raise some red flags. They might indicate testing the system's configuration or attempting to gain deeper access.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because of the combination of events that could suggest malicious activity or at least unauthorized probing.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process accesses and whoami.exe creations may indicate potential unauthorized system probing or malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. I'm supposed to determine if the entire set is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few entries are about 'whoami.exe' being created and powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. 'whoami.exe' is a standard system utility used to display information about the current user. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated access could be concerning.\n\nThere's also an instance where 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'notepad.exe' are accessing registry values. Registry modifications can be part of normal operations, but they're often used by malware to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nI notice that 'calc.exe' is loading urlmon.dll, which isn't typical for a calculator. This might be suspicious as it could indicate the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes or perhaps file tampering.\n\n'Svchost.exe' appears multiple times with registry events. Svchost is part of Windows services and usually runs benign processes, but it's also known to host various services, some of which can be exploited by malware.\n\nThere are entries from 'winlogbeat.exe', which I assume is an agent for collecting logs. That's probably not malicious unless misconfigured or compromised.\n\nThe events involving 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' accessing registry values again makes me think about potential modifications to the system's behavior, possibly for persistence.\n\nLastly, several chrome.exe processes show DNS queries and network connections. While this is normal browsing activity, it could also indicate data exfiltration or communication with malicious servers, especially if the domains queried are suspicious.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there are multiple instances of legitimate tools being used in ways that aren't clearly malicious but could be red flags. The repeated powershell.exe accesses and non-standard activities like calc.exe loading a DLL suggest potential malicious activity. However, without more context or specific indicators of compromise (like known malicious domains or file hashes), it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe confidence level isn't very high because while there are signs that could point to suspicious behavior, they might also just be normal usage, especially if the system is running scripts or has multiple services accessing registry keys.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe access and non-standard activities like calc.exe loading urlmon.dll suggest potential malicious behavior.
