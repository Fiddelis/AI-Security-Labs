{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of system log events to determine if they're worth investigating. First, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is involved in a registry value set. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious since it's often used for scripting, but registry changes could indicate tampering.\n\nNext, cmd.exe runs a command that creates a scheduled task using schtasks.exe. The command line has some red flags like \"\/c\" which suggests it's executing commands, and the script path points to NonExistingScript.ps1. That file doesn't exist, so it might be an attempt to run arbitrary code.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is accessed or created. These could be related to the scheduled tasks mentioned earlier. It's concerning because Powershell is a common tool for attackers due to its extensive capabilities.\n\nLooking at schtasks.exe being used multiple times with specific command-line arguments, this indicates an attempt to create and query scheduled tasks. Creating a task that runs daily might be part of persistence mechanisms in malware, allowing the attacker to maintain access over time.\n\nThere are also events where svchost.exe is modifying registry values and creating files. SvcHost is a common process, but it's known to be used by malware because it hosts various services, making it harder to detect malicious activities. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be an attempt to create persistence points or modify system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother point of concern is the creation of files by svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. While winlogbeat might be legitimate (like a log shipper), the file named .winlogbeat.yml.new seems unusual. The other file created by Powershell, estrutura_geral.txt, could be writing to disk, which in some cases can be part of data exfiltration or setting up configuration files for malicious activities.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events show registry writes, which is odd because Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry frequently. This might suggest that something is using Chrome's process to make changes, possibly indicating a broader system compromise.\n\nPutting this all together: there are multiple instances of Powershell and cmd being used with suspicious command lines, scheduled tasks being created, and svchost.exe making registry modifications. These behaviors are often indicative of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or installing backdoors.\n\nThe confidence level is high because several events point towards potential malicious behavior. The combination of creating scheduled tasks, using Powershell with elevated privileges (bypass execution policy), and file creations by svchost.exe all contribute to the suspicion that this batch might be related to an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe with suspicious command lines suggest potential malicious activity such as creating scheduled tasks or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, file creation events may indicate data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are four events in total. Each one seems to be related to some process and file activities on a Windows system. The events are given in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nLooking at the first event: It mentions 'powershell.exe' as the process name and notes that a file was created (specifically C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_ativo.txt). That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for various system tasks, both legitimate and malicious. The creation of a file could be part of normal operations, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe second event again involves 'powershell.exe' accessing some process. Since the task is labeled as 'Process accessed', this indicates that PowerShell might be interacting with another process. This could be for scripting or automation, which isn't inherently suspicious unless combined with other behaviors.\n\nMoving to the third event, we see 'whoami.exe' being executed. The command line shows it's accessing system32 whoami.exe without any arguments. 'Whoami' is typically used to display user information and is commonly used in scripts for legitimate purposes. However, since it's a simple command without anything unusual, I don't see a red flag here yet.\n\nThe fourth event brings us back to 'powershell.exe' accessing another process. This repetition makes me think that the system is running multiple PowerShell commands or scripts sequentially. While this can be normal in environments where automation is common, the combination with file creation and process access might warrant closer look.\n\nPutting it all together: We have a series of events involving powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes, along with a whoami.exe execution. The key points here are:\n\n1. Use of PowerShell: As mentioned earlier, while not inherently malicious, PowerShell is often targeted by attackers for its powerful scripting capabilities.\n2. File Creation: Creating new files can be part of legitimate operations, but in the context of multiple events and process accesses, it might indicate something more like data exfiltration or log tampering.\n3. Process Accessing: The accessing of other processes by PowerShell could mean privilege escalation attempts or lateral movement within a network if these processes are running with higher privileges.\n4. whoami.exe Execution: This is usually benign but could be part of an attacker's footprinting to gather user information.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, while each individual event might not raise red flags on their own, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell accessing different processes and creating files isn't typical for standard operations. However, without more context or additional events showing clear signs of compromise (like failed logins, unusual network traffic), it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the sequence of actions could indicate a potential attack vector. The confidence isn't too high but there's enough suspicion based on the process activities and file operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and creating files, along with whoami.exe execution, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
