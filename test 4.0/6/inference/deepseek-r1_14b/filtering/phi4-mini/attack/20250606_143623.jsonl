I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. The first few events involve `powershell.exe` being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so frequent access might be suspicious.\n2. There's an event where `whoami.exe` was run without any file access mentioned. Using whoami could help gather user information, which might be part of reconnaissance.\n3. Several instances show `powershell.exe` accessing registry values and creating services like \"objeto_ativo\". Creating new services can indicate persistence mechanisms, a red flag for potential malware.\n4. Multiple registry writes by both `powershell.exe` and `services.exe` are present. Unusual registry activity often is malicious as it's used for persistence or configuration changes.\n5. There are file deletions involving a PowerShell script test file. Deleting files related to scripts could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n6. The events include several image loads from various DLLs, which might be normal, but combined with other activities, they add up.\n7. Lastly, `tarefa_logico.exe` loading `mscoree.dll` is noted. This file path seems legitimate, but paired with other actions could indicate malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple uses of PowerShell, creation of new services, registry modifications, and a file deletion—these are classic signs of potential malicious behavior. The batch shows a pattern that suggests an attack vector being tested or established.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the system, creating services, modifying registry values, and file deletions indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are two events from \"tarefa_logico.exe\". It looks like it's loading some .NET framework DLLs: mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Those are legitimate files, part of the .NET runtime. So that might be normal unless this process is doing something else suspicious later.\n\nThen, there's a PowerShell event where a file was created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That could be normal if it's just configuration, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for lateral movement or to execute scripts. I'll need to see more context.\n\nThere are multiple events from services.exe and svchost.exe setting registry values. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process that handles service control manager tasks, so some registry activity might be normal. Svchost.exe is a common host process for various system services, but if it's making too many changes or accessing unusual areas, that could be concerning.\n\nLooking at the frequency: there are 17 events from svchost.exe all doing Registry value sets. That seems excessive and possibly suspicious because legitimate processes usually don't make so many registry changes unless something is wrong with the system or an attacker is using it for persistence.\n\nThe last event is about a file creation in WindowsUpdate logs. It's a normal process, but sometimes attackers delete or modify update logs to hide their tracks, so if there are anomalies here, it might indicate tampering.\n\nPutting it all together: The high number of registry changes from svchost.exe and services.exe stands out. Additionally, the PowerShell activity could be malicious. These behaviors together might suggest some form of persistence, data exfiltration, or system configuration changes typical in an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events from svchost.exe and services.exe may indicate suspicious activity, along with PowerShell file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I see that there are multiple entries from processes like svchost.exe and setup.exe performing various tasks.\n\nFirst, svchost.exe is known as a legitimate Windows process, often used by services. The events show it setting registry values and modifying the registry, which isn't unusual since many system processes do this.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating several files under the Microsoft Edge directory. This looks like standard installation activity for an application. The creation of these files seems normal during software setup or updates.\n\nI don't notice any red flags here. No signs of malicious activities like unauthorized file accesses, network communications, or known bad processes.

Let's start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events involve setup.exe and services.exe making changes to the registry. Setup.exe is a common installer, so it makes sense that it would modify the registry during installation. Services.exe is related to system services, so some registry activity there isn't unusual either. These initial events seem normal for software installations or updates.\n\nThen I notice that setup.exe creates files in various locations. For example, creating msedge_proxy.exe and a shortcut in the start menu. That's typical when installing an application like Microsoft Edge—it places executables and shortcuts where they should be. No red flags there.\n\nThere are also pipe creation events from setup.exe. Pipes are used for interprocess communication, which is common during installations to set up services or communicate with other processes. This isn't something suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further down, RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe are involved in creating files in the Windows Temp directory. Svchost.exe is a known system process that can create temporary files, especially for services and background processes. The file paths look like they're related to appx packages, which suggests these might be part of an application deployment or update process.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing a lot of repeated events—like multiple registry writes from setup.exe and services.exe, and several file creations with similar names in the temp directory. This repetition could indicate that something is looping or processing multiple tasks, but without additional context, it's hard to say if this is normal or part of a malicious process.\n\nThe lack of any unusual processes or events like network connections, file deletions, or access to sensitive areas makes me lean towards these being legitimate activities. They seem consistent with an application installation or updates, possibly during a system update or software deployment.\n\nI'm considering the possibility that this could be related to a side-loader or persistence mechanism if setup.exe is writing too many registry entries, but without seeing actual payloads or other indicators of compromise, it's safer to assume normalcy unless there are clear signs of malicious intent.\n\nIn conclusion, while some activities like repeated registry modifications and pipe creations can raise eyebrows, the overall pattern aligns with typical system behaviors during installations and updates. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem particularly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve normal system processes such as file creation, registry modifications, and pipe creations by known system executables like setup.exe, services.exe, and svchost.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, the user has provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first few events mention 'svchost.exe' creating files in various locations like Temp and AppReadiness directories. I know that svchost is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services, so some file creation might be normal.\n\nLooking closer, the file paths seem unusual, especially temporary files with long names. This could indicate something suspicious because legitimate processes usually don't create such lengthy temp files, or at least not in the same way. The repetition of creating the same files multiple times (like the S-1-5-... paths) might be a red flag. It seems like svchost is doing a lot of file operations, which could be part of malicious activities like dropping files or establishing persistence.\n\nThen there are events where svchost.exe is modifying the registry by setting values. This is concerning because attackers often use registry modifications to maintain persistence or change system configurations. The fact that this happens multiple times reinforces the idea that something might be off.\n\nNext, I see an event involving 'RuntimeBroker.exe' making a registry change. While Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process, any unexpected registry activity from it could be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger pattern with other processes like svchost.\n\nThe last few events switch to powershell.exe. The command line shows that Powershell is being executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted and runs a simple Write-Host command. That seems innocent at first glance, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of executing malicious scripts or obfuscating commands.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events for various DLLs which could indicate Powershell loading modules, and a FileCreate event for a .psm1 file in the Temp directory. This temp PowerShell script is another red flag because attackers often use such files to execute malicious code temporarily.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple instances of svchost.exe creating unusual files and modifying the registry, along with powershell.exe executing commands and creating temporary scripts, suggest potential malicious activity. The repeated actions might be part of a larger campaign to establish persistence or carry out attacks. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in unusual locations and modifying the registry, along with powershell.exe executing commands and creating a temporary script file, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal because it's a common tool used to get user information. No red flags there.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The second event shows powershell.exe accessing something, then creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Creating files with PowerShell can be part of legitimate scripts, but I should keep an eye on what's being created. Then, in another event, it's executing some command that checks for specific .inf files and writes a result. This seems like it could be checking system configurations or drivers, which might not be malicious but could indicate some activity.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. That's standard when running scripts in PowerShell as it loads the necessary libraries. Not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, there's a file creation event for a temporary .psm1 script. Temporary PowerShell files might be part of script execution or testing, but I should consider if this is expected behavior or not. If it's a script dropped by an external process, that could be concerning.\n\nA Pipe Created event follows, which is normal for inter-process communication in PowerShell scripts.\n\nAnother Process Create event shows cmd.exe running a Dism command to disable Windows Defender features and remove them without restarting. This caught my attention because disabling or removing defender components can lower system security. If this was initiated by a legitimate script or user action, it might be intentional, but if unauthorized, it's risky.\n\nFollowing that, Dism.exe is created and then there are multiple File Executable Detected events loading various DLLs from temporary paths. This suggests that Dism.exe is executing some files, which might be part of the process to remove defender features. However, these could also indicate malicious activities like dropping payload files or installing backdoors.\n\nPutting it all together, the sequence starts with legitimate system checks and script executions but escalates to disabling security features and loading external DLLs from temporary locations. These actions, especially when chained together (using powershell.exe and then cmd.exe\/Dism.exe), could be part of a larger attack vector aiming to reduce system defenses.\n\nI'm concerned that the combination of disabling defender, creating temporary files with PowerShell, and loading executable components might indicate an attempt to lower system security or deploy malicious software. While each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious, their sequence and context suggest potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving PowerShell executing commands that check for specific .inf files and creating temporary files, along with the disabling of Windows Defender features.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's look at the data.\n\nAll events have the process name \"Dism.exe\". Dism usually stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, which is a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing Windows images. So that's a good start—it's not immediately suspicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog task descriptions: most are \"File Executable Detected\" with rule FileExecutableDetected, except one which mentions \"File created\". This suggests Dism.exe is creating or detecting files in a specific location.\n\nThe file paths all point to temporary directories under C:\\Users\\...AppData\\Local\\Temp. The folder name starts with 33BFE96B-A8C1-4275..., which looks like a GUID, often used by Windows for temporary files. That's standard practice for apps needing temporary space.\n\nThe filenames include various .dll and .mui files. Dism does handle several DLLs during its operations, especially when dealing with image servicing. The .mui files are likely language-specific resources, which makes sense in a deployment context.\n\nI'm also noting that all these events are generated by the same process and within the same temporary directory. No signs of multiple processes or unusual locations. There's no indication of file deletions, access to restricted areas, or other behaviors that would raise red flags.\n\nSince Dism.exe is known for creating temp files and executing DLLs as part of its normal operation, these events seem entirely legitimate.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events provided. Each event is in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. The task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each event. Each entry has three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\n- **Process**: All events show 'Dism.exe' as the process name. Dism.exe is known to be related to the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool in Windows. It's typically used for servicing Windows images and can extract or apply updates.\n\n- **Winlog**: Each event has a task named 'File Executable Detected', which triggers a rule called 'FileExecutableDetected'. This suggests that the system detected an executable file being processed or accessed, likely as part of normal operations but could be indicative of malicious activity if the context is suspicious.\n\n- **File**: The path varies across different DLL files located in the temporary directory under C:\\Users\\... These include various providers like ImagingProvider.dll.mui, IntlProvider.dll.mui, and others. Some of these are .mui files which are usually resource files for localization, and some are .dll which are dynamic link libraries.\n\nLooking at the batch as a whole, I notice that all events have the same process (Dism.exe) repeatedly detecting executable files in a temporary directory. Dism.exe is a legitimate system tool, often used during Windows setup or updates. The fact that it's processing multiple DLL and MUI files doesn't immediately raise red flags because such operations are part of its normal functionality.\n\nHowever, the frequency might be worth noting—there are 14 events here, each pointing to a different file. While Dism.exe could process many files during its operation, especially in bulk scenarios like applying updates or servicing an image, it's essential to consider whether this volume is typical for the system in question. If the system is undergoing an update or deployment, these events might be expected.\n\nAnother consideration is the path structure. Temporary directories are common places where such tools write files during operations. The fact that all files are under a single temporary directory created by Dism.exe supports the idea that this is part of a legitimate process.\n\nI should also think about potential red flags. If Dism.exe were being used as part of a malicious payload, there might be additional indicators like writes to unexpected locations, attempts to execute with higher privileges, or deviations from normal operation times. But in these events alone, there's no evidence of such behavior. The files being processed are standard types for this tool.\n\nMoreover, 'FileExecutableDetected' is a generic event that could trigger on any executable file access. Without additional context, it's hard to determine if this is malicious or just normal system activity.\n\nIn summary, while each event individually might not be concerning, the pattern of multiple events from Dism.exe processing files in a temp directory doesn't indicate suspicious activity. It aligns with legitimate operations involving servicing or updating the system. Therefore, unless there are other indicators or anomalies present that aren't captured here, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"incident\": {\n    \"title\": \"Analysis of Dism.exe Processing Multiple Files\",\n    \"summary\": \"The batch of events shows legitimate system activity with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n    \"determination\": \"not_interesting\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. All of them are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to look at the entire batch together and decide if it's something interesting that might need investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that each event has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always 'Dism.exe', which stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. That's a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing Windows images. So, right off the bat, Dism.exe isn't something malicious on its own.\n\nThe winlog field consistently mentions \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\". This sounds like a standard security alert that an executable file has been detected somewhere in the system. These kinds of alerts are pretty common and usually not cause for alarm unless they're happening in conjunction with other suspicious activities.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, each event points to a different DLL file located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. The filenames vary but all end with .dll, which makes sense because Dism.exe often works with various providers and components during image servicing operations. The path structure seems normal for such processes.\n\nI notice that there are multiple events, each detecting a different DLL file. This could be part of a legitimate operation where Dism.exe is processing several provider files as part of its standard tasks. It's not unusual for such tools to generate multiple file detection events when they're handling various components during an image servicing task like deployment or updates.\n\nI should consider whether the number of events here is typical. If Dism.exe is running a process that involves multiple DLLs, this volume could be normal. However, if it were a malicious actor trying to spread out files quickly, we might see more varied file types or locations, but in this case, all are standard DLLs in a temporary directory.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these events are logged under the same process and rule makes me think it's part of a single operation rather than multiple separate activities. If there were signs like varying file hashes, different user accounts accessing them, or attempts to execute these files immediately after detection, that would raise more flags.\n\nAnother thing to check is the timestamps of these events. Are they all occurring within a short time frame? That could indicate a batch process, which aligns with Dism.exe operations during system setup or updates. Without seeing the exact times, though, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI should also think about whether this activity correlates with any user actions. If the user is performing an image deployment or running a script that triggers Dism.exe, then these events are expected. However, if there were no such activities and the system was idle, that would be more concerning.\n\nIn summary, each event points to legitimate file operations by a known Microsoft tool during servicing tasks. The repetition and specific paths align with normal behavior for Dism.exe, and without additional indicators of compromise or unusual patterns, I wouldn't flag this as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events analyzed consists of 14 entries generated by the `Dism.exe` process, which is a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing and managing deployment images. Each event indicates that an executable file was detected in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder, with filenames ending in `.dll`. These DLL files are standard components often processed by Dism.exe during image servicing operations such as deployment or updates.\n\nKey observations:\n1. **Process Name**: `Dism.exe` is a known legitimate tool used for system image management.\n2. **Event Consistency**: All events follow the same structure, indicating they were generated by the same process and rule.\n3. **File Paths**: The files are located in a temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`) and are DLLs, which align with Dism.exe's typical operations.\n4. **Volume of Events**: The multiple entries suggest a batch processing task, consistent with legitimate servicing activities.\n\nConclusion:\nThe events are likely part of a legitimate operation by `Dism.exe` during system servicing. There is no evidence of malicious activity in the provided data, and the pattern aligns with expected behavior for such processes. Therefore, this batch of logs does not indicate suspicious or harmful activity requiring investigation."}

Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about Dism.exe being the process name, with a winlog task indicating \"File Executable Detected\". The file path points to WimProvider.dll in a temporary directory. That seems normal because Dism.exe is related to disk management in Windows, so loading DLLs could be part of its operation.\n\nThen there are several events all from DismHost.exe, each showing that an image was loaded with the same task name \"Image Load\". All these files are different DLLs located in the same temporary directory.

Since this follows the earlier events where that specific DLL was loaded and executed, it makes sense to delete it afterward to clean up temporary files.\n\nPutting all these together, everything seems consistent with normal operations of DismHost.exe and related processes.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. The user has given me a batch of system log events in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. All of them have the process name as 'Dism.exe'. Dism usually stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool in Windows. It's a legitimate system utility used for servicing Windows images. So, seeing it execute various file operations isn't immediately suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking deeper into the events, most of them are \"File Delete logged\" events with different files being deleted. The paths all point to temporary directories under 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp'. The filenames vary but seem to be related to DLLs and MUI (Multi-Use Independent) files. These are common types for dynamic link libraries and language-pack related resources.\n\nI notice that one of the events is a \"File creation time changed\", which could indicate an attempt to alter file metadata, possibly to evade detection. However, since Dism.exe is known to handle such operations as part of system servicing, this might not be malicious in itself.\n\nThe repeated pattern of deleting multiple files from a temporary directory suggests that this operation is part of a legitimate process. Temporary files are often cleaned up after use by applications like installers or update tools. Dism.exe could be involved in deploying updates or managing components, which would involve creating and then deleting these files.\n\nConsidering the combination of all events, there's consistency in the process name and the types of operations being performed. No anomalies like unusual file paths, execution times outside normal operations, or deviations from expected behavior are apparent here.\n\nI should also think about whether similar patterns have been observed in malicious activities. Typically, attackers might try to hide their actions by using legitimate tools or processes, but in this case, the activity aligns with what Dism.exe is supposed to do. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or data exfiltration; it's purely file operations within a known temporary directory.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the user context. The files are under 'fiddelis' user profile. If this were a system account or had elevated privileges, it might raise more flags, but without additional information, I can't assume that here.\n\nIn summary, each event seems legitimate when viewed in isolation, and together they form a coherent sequence of actions expected from Dism.exe during its normal operations. There's no red flag indicating malicious intent or unauthorized activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events appears to be legitimate and related to the operation of `Dism.exe`, which is a known Windows utility used for servicing and managing deployment images.

I know that Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. It's usually used by sysadmins for managing Windows images, so it's part of legitimate system operations.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every event says \"File Delete logged\" with a specific rule mentioned. That suggests that a file deletion was detected and logged. But since Dism.exe is a known system tool, this activity could be normal if it's during an image deployment or servicing process.\n\nThe file paths all point to temporary directories under the user's AppData folder. Each path ends with different .dll.mui files. The naming conventions like 'GenericProvider.dll.mui', 'IBSProvider.dll.mui', etc., seem related to system components, possibly language or regional settings providers. These are standard files that might be part of Windows updates or servicing packs.\n\nSince all the events have the same process and similar file paths, it looks like a series of deletions from the same temporary directory. Dism.exe is known to create and delete temporary files as part of its operations. So this batch could just be part of a legitimate update or deployment process.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The combination of the process name, file types, and paths doesn't indicate anything malicious.

All events are consistent with normal Dism.exe operations, which are expected to delete temporary files when they're done.\n\nTherefore, while the system is logging these deletes as per security rules, the combination of all events points to a legitimate process rather than something malicious or suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process:** All events involve `Dism.exe`, which is a known legitimate Windows tool for managing OS images.\n\n2. **Understand File Deletions:** The files being deleted are DLLs located in the Temp directory, which is typical during cleanup after Dism operations.\n\n3. **Check Event Consistency:** Each event has similar file paths and tasks, indicating a systematic cleanup rather than random deletions.\n\n4. **Assess for Anomalies:** No unusual patterns or locations suggest unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The events are part of normal system maintenance by Dism.exe, hence not indicative of security issues.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events represent legitimate file deletion activities by `Dism.exe` during its standard operations, such as OS deployment or updates. These actions are expected and do not indicate suspicious behavior. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"Not Suspicious\",\n  \"description\": \"These events are part of normal Dism.exe operations for cleaning temporary files.\"\n}\n```"}

It seems like there are multiple entries here, each with a \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" field. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial logs mention a process named \"svchost.exe\". I know that svchost is a common Windows process used by services. But in some cases, malicious software might disguise itself as svchost.exe to blend in with normal system processes. So, this could be suspicious if it's doing something unexpected.\n\nThen there are several entries where the command line shows powershell.exe being executed with some commands. The commands seem to involve creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starting it. This is interesting because PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious purposes, like executing scripts or creating services that might have malicious behavior.\n\nLooking closer at the command line:\n```\npowershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\" Start-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}\n```\nThis creates a service that runs `tarefa_logico.exe`. I'm not familiar with this executable, but the path seems a bit long and includes \"unidade_logico\" which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese. Maybe it's part of some software component.\n\nThe last few entries have a different command line:\n```\npowershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\n```\nThis seems like a script that just writes a message to the console, indicating a successful execution. But using `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is unusual because it restricts the PowerShell from executing scripts unless they are signed. This might be an attempt to execute something more malicious by bypassing certain security policies.\n\nNow, looking at the \"winlog\" field, most entries have tasks like \"Process Create\", \"Registry value set\", and various \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". These seem normal for a system's operation, especially when services are being created or modified. However, the fact that these events are happening alongside the PowerShell commands makes me think they're part of an attack chain.\n\nI'm also noticing that some entries have \"file\": \"None\", which probably means no file was associated with that event, but others might have had files if they were present.\n\nPutting it all together, this looks like a potential malicious activity where an attacker is using PowerShell to create a new service on the system. The creation of a service could allow persistence—meaning the malware would restart each time the system boots. The \"svchost.exe\" process being logged might be related to how the service is running or maybe it's just another step in the attack.\n\nI should check if there are any known indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to \"objeto_ativo\" or \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Maybe doing a quick search or using threat intelligence tools could reveal if this is part of a known campaign. Also, looking into the file path for \"C:\\unidade_logico\\...\" might show if that directory is legitimate or if it's been created by malicious software.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the use of multiple entries creating the same service. It makes me think that maybe there was an attempt to create it multiple times, possibly to ensure persistence even if one instance fails.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might seem benign, the combination of using PowerShell to create a new service, coupled with the specific command-line arguments and the use of svchost.exe, raises red flags for potential malicious activity. It would be wise to investigate further by checking system processes, looking into the files involved, and ensuring that no unauthorized services are running.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log data indicates potential malicious activities involving the creation of a new service using PowerShell. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Process Activity**:\n   - A process named \"svchost.exe\" is logged. This is common for system services but can be suspicious if associated with unusual behavior.\n\n2. **PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Multiple entries show the execution of `powershell.exe` commands to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\". The service runs `tarefa_logico.exe`, located in a specific directory.\n   - Subsequent commands use `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` to execute scripts, which is unusual and might indicate an attempt to bypass security restrictions.\n\n3. **Registry and Service Creation**:\n   - Entries mention registry value sets and process creation tasks, which are typical when services are created or modified but could signal malicious activity if part of a broader attack chain.\n\n4. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - The service name \"objeto_ativo\" and the file path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` should be checked against known threats.\n   - The repeated creation of the same service suggests potential persistence mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**: This activity raises concerns about a possible malware attack aiming for system persistence. Further investigation is recommended, including checking for unauthorized services and verifying the legitimacy of the involved files and processes."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. They're all in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve PowerShell commands executed with the -ExecutionPolicy Restricted flag. This caught my attention because scripts usually run under this policy only if they're signed by trusted publishers, which makes them less likely to be malicious in most cases, but it's still something to keep an eye on.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the first few events have a simple Write-Host command that just outputs 'Final result: 1'. That seems benign enough. However, towards the middle of the batch, the commands get more complex. They're querying the Windows INF directory for files and checking if they contain specific patterns related to installation sections like '[defaultinstall.nt...]'.\n\nThis kind of activity can be either legitimate or malicious. On one hand, enumerating system files could be part of a routine system check or script execution, especially in environments where such scripts are standard. On the other hand, it might indicate that an attacker is trying to identify potential drivers or components that could be exploited.\n\nAnother point I'm considering is the repetition of these events. There are multiple instances of similar commands, which suggests either automated execution (part of a scheduled task) or a script looping through several files. The fact that some events have 'Provider Lifecycle' and others 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks makes me think they're related to different phases of PowerShell's operation.\n\nThe presence of multiple such events with the same command line across various log entries could be an indicator of lateral movement within a network, where an attacker is checking systems for vulnerabilities. Alternatively, it might just be a legitimate script running on multiple machines or being run multiple times.\n\nSince the commands are accessing system files and looking for specific patterns, there's a risk that this activity could be probing for something malicious. The confidence level isn't super high because the activities themselves aren't overtly malicious, but they do have potential for misuse. However, given that all events use '-ExecutionPolicy Restricted', which is usually tightly controlled, it might suggest that these are trusted scripts.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while each event individually may not raise red flags, the combination of multiple such events across different log entries and their specific nature could indicate suspicious activity worth investigating further. The confidence isn't very high (around 0.7) because there's a good chance these are legitimate scripts, but the possibility of malicious intent can't be entirely ruled out.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell commands that access system files and check for specific patterns, which could indicate potential malicious activity or probing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
