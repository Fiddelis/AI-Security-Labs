{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is from MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That's normal since it's likely part of the antivirus service checking for updates or scanning the network.\n\nNext, I see several chrome.exe entries related to DNS queries and network connections. Chrome often connects to various servers for browsing and extensions, so this isn't unusual unless there's an unusual number or destination.\n\nThen, there are multiple powershell.exe events with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is commonly used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. The process accesses suggest it's reading other processes, which could be legitimate or malicious activity. The registry writes might be normal admin work or part of a script.\n\nLooking at the whoami.exe command line, it's just running as-is without any suspicious arguments. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nCmd.exe events stand out because they're executing commands like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key | findstr \/e .key'. That seems to be searching for files ending with .key in the C drive. This could indicate someone looking for sensitive files, maybe API keys or certificates. Depending on who is running it and why, this could be malicious.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe command that runs 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' without the findstr part. Again, searching for .key files but more straightforward. Could be benign admin work or something else.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file sounds like log shipping, so that's normal unless it's writing to unexpected locations. The same with notepad.exe accessing registryâ€”probably unrelated unless it's trying to elevate privileges.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe is a Windows process for app sandboxing, so seeing it interact with the registry isn't unusual.\n\nOverall, the cmd.exe commands searching for .key files are the red flags here. This behavior might indicate someone probing for sensitive information, which could be malicious. Since these events are spread across different processes and times, there's no immediate evidence of a breach, but they do raise suspicions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple cmd.exe commands searching for .key files and powershell.exe accessing registry values may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's an event where calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That seems normal because calc.exe is a standard calculator app, and it might need some DLLs to run. But I'm not sure if that's suspicious or just regular behavior.\n\nNext, I notice several events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process used by various services, so seeing it interact with the registry isn't unusual. However, multiple instances doing this could be a red flag, but I need to see if they're all legitimate operations or something more malicious.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is likely the agent used for collecting logs, so it making changes to its own config might not be suspicious on its own. It could just be updating or initializing settings.\n\nLooking at ApplicationFrameHost.exe, that's another system-related process. It's associated with things like the Start menu and windows shell, so registry interactions here seem normal.\n\nPowershell.exe appears a few times. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers because it can execute scripts and do many things. The events show it accessing processes and possibly setting registry values. That could be concerning if there's no clear reason for these actions, but sometimes legitimate scripts use Powershell too.\n\nChrome.exe has multiple events: creating pipes, loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are related to antivirus or system security. Those might be normal as part of browser operations. However, the repeated registry writes could indicate some tracking or persistence mechanisms, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLastly, whoami.exe is run with its command line showing a standard path. Whoami is typically used to display user information and isn't malicious on its own unless it's part of a larger script or process that's doing something else nefarious.\n\nPutting this all together, most events are normal system processes performing their usual tasks. The only potential red flags could be the multiple registry writes by svchost.exe and powershell.exe accesses. But without evidence of these actions leading to unauthorized changes or being part of an attack chain, they might just be legitimate operations. So, while there's a slight chance some activities could be malicious, there's not enough clear indication to classify this batch as definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing typical tasks such as registry modifications and file operations. There are no clear indicators of malicious behavior in the provided logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
