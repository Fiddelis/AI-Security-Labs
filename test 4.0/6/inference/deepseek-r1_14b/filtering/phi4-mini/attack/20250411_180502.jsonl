Chrome is a common application, so these might just be normal activity, especially when dealing with browsing and online activities. However, it's worth noting that repeated network connections could potentially indicate something malicious, but without more context on the nature of those connections, I'm leaning towards them being benign.\n\nNext, there are several events from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by both administrators and attackers. The logs show various activities: setting registry values, loading images, creating files, deleting files, and pipe creation. These actions in themselves aren't necessarily malicious but could be part of legitimate scripting or administrative tasks.\n\nLooking closer, there are file operations involving temporary paths like 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1'. The creation and subsequent deletion of a file in the Temp directory could be part of script execution testing or policy enforcement checks. This might not raise immediate red flags, but it's worth monitoring for frequency and unusual patterns.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'powershell.exe' with command lines that start other batch files. For example, \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\unidade_comum\\\\..\\\\estrutura_ativo\\\\estrutura_geral_script.bat\". While running scripts via PowerShell can be normal, it's crucial to check if these batch files are performing actions beyond their expected scope, such as accessing sensitive data or making unauthorized network calls.\n\nAdditionally, there are events from 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' and 'Calculator.exe', both setting registry values. These are standard system processes that interact with the registry for configuration purposes, so this activity is likely normal and not indicative of malicious behavior.\n\nThe event where a process accessed another process via 'ProcessAccess' rule in PowerShell could be an indicator of lateral movement or privilege escalation if the access isn't authorized. However, without more context on which processes are being accessed, it's hard to assess the risk here.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, especially around the use of PowerShell for various operations that could be part of legitimate administration tasks or potential malicious scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell executing commands with suspicious file operations in temporary directories suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not. The user has provided 20 JSONL entries. Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nStarting with the first event: Chrome.exe creating a pipe. That's normal because Chrome often creates pipes for interprocess communication. Next, multiple events show Chrome setting registry valuesâ€”this also seems standard as applications frequently interact with the registry.\n\nLooking at PowerShell activity: One event shows powershell.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL used by IE and other browsers. Then there's an attempt to create a file in the StartupProfileData folder. That might be suspicious because it's under the user's directory, but sometimes scripts do write there for non-malicious reasons.\n\nThere are cmd.exe processes executing a batch script. Batch files can automate tasks, so this could be either benign or malicious depending on the script content. Powershell accessing another process and creating a file in the Downloads folder could indicate data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms. The svchost.exe creating a file under NetworkService's AppData might relate to legitimate service operations but could also be part of malware trying to hide.\n\nI notice multiple registry writes by various processes, which is common during installations or updates but can also be used by malware for persistence. The combination of Chrome, PowerShell, cmd.exe, and svchost activities with file creations in user directories and registry modifications raises some red flags, especially the PowerShell activity creating files outside its usual paths.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or known indicators, it's hard to say definitively if this is malicious. Some actions are normal, others could be signs of compromise. The batch as a whole shows varied activities that might warrant closer investigation but aren't conclusively malicious yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show unusual PowerShell activity and file creations, including attempts to create files in user directories which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, there are four entries where the process is \"chrome.exe\" and the task is a registry value being set. This seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions. Each event is from the same process and task type, so nothing unusual here.\n\nThen, there's an entry from \"winlogbeat.exe\". It mentions creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so it makes sense that it would create configuration files like .yml.new. This doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThe last event is from \"powershell.exe\" creating a file named elemento_base.txt in the user's Downloads folder. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. However, without additional context or multiple suspicious events related to it, this single file creation might not indicate malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, none of them individually or collectively show signs of malicious behavior. The activities are within normal operational parameters for the mentioned processes and don't trigger any security alarms based on what's provided.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include standard user activity such as Chrome registry interactions, legitimate file creation by winlogbeat.exe for configuration, and a file created by powershell.exe in the user's Downloads folder. No indicators of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
