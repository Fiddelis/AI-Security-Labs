{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is telling me.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe with tasks related to DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that makes lots of network requests. But then I notice some powershell.exe processes popping up. Powershell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so this catches my attention.\n\nLooking at the powershell events, I see things like registry value sets and image loads. These could indicate script execution or module loading, which might be part of a normal script but could also signify something more nefarious. Then there are file creation and deletion events for temporary PowerShell scripts. Creating a script in temp and then deleting it sounds suspicious because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nThe command lines in the powershell.exe processes show that they're downloading files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. The URLs point to different paths like LICENSE.txt, but I'm concerned about what those files actually contain. If these are part of a script, they might be executing arbitrary code or setting up some kind of persistence.\n\nAlso, multiple download attempts from different GitHub paths suggest that this activity isn't just one-off; it's repeated, which raises the risk that each could be deploying malicious components. The fact that each event is using powershell.exe with similar patterns makes me think it's a script executing multiple actions, possibly indicators of lateral movement or payload delivery.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of downloading files via Powershell into TEMP and then deleting them, along with registry modifications, points towards potential malicious activity like script execution, file download, and possible persistence mechanisms. This batch definitely needs investigation because these activities could be signs of a breach.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes show suspicious behavior including downloading files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory, creating temporary script files, and deleting them.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also commonly exploited by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines show that powershell is downloading files from GitHub repositories. For example, one event shows downloading \"LICENSE.txt\" from a specific path. That seems unusual because why would they download a license file? Also, the paths where these files are being saved look suspicious, like temporary directories or locations in the user's Downloads folder.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell is involved in file creation and other system activities. Then I see several chrome.exe entries with registry modifications. While Chrome can make registry changes normally, multiple such events might indicate something malicious trying to persist on the system.\n\nAnother red flag is the download from GitHub repositories. If an attacker is using a legitimate site like GitHub to host malicious code, it could be part of a supply chain attack or a way to hide malicious activities behind a benign-looking URL. The filenames being downloaded, like \"estrutura_temporario.txt\" and \"tarefa_ativo.txt,\" don't seem to have any clear purpose.\n\nThere's also an entry from MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection. That's odd because Windows Defender processes shouldn't typically initiate unexpected network connections. This could indicate that the process is being used as part of an attack or has been compromised.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting logs, but if it's behaving abnormally, like creating unnecessary files, it might be part of log tampering or setup for further malicious activities.\n\nThe events involving conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry are also worth noting. Conhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but its interaction with the registry in this context could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell downloads from potentially suspicious URLs, unusual file creations, registry modifications across different processes, and an unexpected network activity from Defender's service makes me think that this batch is indicative of malicious behavior. These activities don't seem to align with normal user or system operations. Therefore, the batch should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub repositories and creating files in temporary directories, along with suspicious registry modifications and network activity from MpDefenderCoreService.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice a lot of activity from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common Windows process that can be legitimate or malicious. But in this case, since it's just setting registry values without any other suspicious indicators like file writes or network traffic, maybe it's not too concerning yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad, so I need to check the command lines. The first time, there's no command line details, but later instances show commands like accessing processes and deleting registry entries. This could be a sign of malicious activity because attackers often use tools like PowerShell for command execution and persistence.\n\nThere are several cmd.exe instances with specific command-line arguments. For example, one uses SCHTASKS to delete a task named 'spawn'. Task deletion can be part of removing traces or preventing scheduled tasks from running. Another cmd.exe runs REG DELETE to remove a registry entry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for \"modulo_temporario\". This seems like an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms, which is often a sign of malicious activity because attackers don't want their tools to be detected on next boot.\n\nI also see schtasks.exe being used to delete the same 'spawn' task. Again, this deletion could be part of removing traces left by malware. The fact that both cmd and schtasks are involved strengthens the idea that someone is cleaning up after themselves.\n\nLooking further, there's a reg.exe process deleting another registry value \"pacote_auxiliar\". This is another instance of modifying the system's registry to remove persistence points. Attackers often do this to ensure their malicious processes don't start automatically next time.\n\nConhost.exe is also seen setting registry values. Conhost is typically used for console applications, but when combined with unusual registry activity, it could indicate that it's being exploited as part of an attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, whoami.exe is run several times without any command-line arguments. While whoami is a legitimate tool to check user permissions, repeated executions in quick succession might be suspicious, especially if they don't seem necessary for the current task.\n\nPutting this all together: there's a lot of activity involving deleting tasks and registry entries, which are common steps in an attacker's kill chain when trying to erase their footprint. The use of multiple tools like cmd.exe, schtasks, reg.exe, and powershell.exe suggests a coordinated effort that could be part of malicious activities such as installing malware, establishing persistence, or cleaning up after an attack.\n\nWhile individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination and frequency of these actions are concerning. The repeated attempts to modify and delete system configurations point towards potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry deletions, process creations, and task deletions indicate potential malicious activity attempting to remove traces.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"powershell.exe\". PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities, so that catches my attention. The command line in some of these events shows things like \"& {}\", which seems a bit odd. I'm not sure what that signifies immediately, but it's worth looking into.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are various events: Process accessed, Provider Lifecycle, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, and more. The use of registry modifications (RegistryEvent) is notable because attackers often modify system configurations to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThe file paths associated with these events include system32 files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are legitimate, but then there's a PowerShell script being created and deleted in the Temp directory. The creation and subsequent deletion of a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1) might indicate that something was tested or executed temporarily, which could be part of malicious activity.\n\nAnother event involves \"whoami.exe\" being run, which is a common tool for gathering system information. If this is triggered by PowerShell, it could be part of an attack chain to gather credentials or other sensitive data.\n\nThere's also an entry with \"conhost.exe\", which is a legitimate Windows process used for console applications. However, when paired with other suspicious activities, it might warrant closer inspection.\n\nThe repeated pattern of creating and deleting files, accessing processes, and modifying the registry all point towards potential malicious behavior. While some events on their own might not be alarming, the combination over multiple entries suggests a possible attack vector, especially considering the use of PowerShell, which is commonly exploited by attackers.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and potential script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where cmd.exe and conhost.exe are involved in setting registry values. That's somewhat common for legitimate activities, but it could also be part of malicious behavior like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed without any unusual command-line arguments. That seems benign, maybe a user checking their permissions or an automated script.\n\nThe majority of the events involve powershell.exe with various tasks. There are multiple instances where powershell is accessing processes, setting registry values, loading images, and creating files. This catches my attention because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command and control due to its flexibility and access to system functions.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory related to a script policy test. This could be an attempt to execute malicious scripts or test script execution policies. The creation and subsequent deletion might be part of hiding traces, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe is creating pipes, which can be used for inter-process communication but are also red flags for lateral movement within a network. Combined with the registry modifications, this could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or spread across systems.\n\nOther events involve applications like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying the registry, which isn't unusual, but when combined with the other activities involving powershell.exe, it raises suspicion. The repeated use of powershell with different tasks might suggest a broader attack campaign.\n\nI also notice that some powershell.exe entries have command lines that appear empty or are obfuscated, which is another red flag for malicious activity. Attackers often use such techniques to hide their commands from detection.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of multiple system accesses and file operations that don't seem to align with normal user behavior. The combination of registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, pipe creations, and varied process accesses using powershell.exe is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activities including registry modifications, file operations, and pipe creations, along with other system processes that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's look through the events step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit unusual because Chrome doesn't typically change system-wide registry settings, which makes me wonder if it's part of some malicious activity or a misconfiguration.\n\nThen I see several instances where powershell.exe is being run with command lines that include \"&\" and script paths. This could indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts, which are often used in attacks for tasks like file operations, process manipulation, and more. The fact that they're using \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" might be trying to hide errors if something goes wrong.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line with \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip\". This is attempting to delete files in the TEMP directory. Removing specific files could be an attempt to clean up traces of previous activities, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation and deletion events for temporary PowerShell scripts (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1). Creating and then deleting such scripts quickly can help avoid detection by security tools. Also, loading various .NET framework DLLs might be part of obfuscating the script's true purpose or evading analysis.\n\nThe events involving conhost.exe and whoami.exe are also notable. Conhost is often used in command-line environments, but its use here without clear context could be suspicious. Whoami.exe is typically used to determine user information, which might be part of reconnaissance activities before more malicious actions.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with file deletions, registry modifications, and temporary script creations suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to delete specific files and use of \"&\" in command lines are red flags that could indicate an attacker trying to cover their tracks or execute multiple commands in a single process.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events shows signs of potentially malicious activity, making it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including file deletions and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being used to remove files from the TEMP directory. The commands look like they're trying to delete specific ZIP and TXT files, but with some generic names. This could be normal cleanup, but it might also indicate malicious activity because attackers often clean up after themselves.\n\nThen, I see Chrome-related events: registry changes and loading system DLLs. That seems standard for a browser process, so probably not suspicious on their own. There's also an instance of 'whoami.exe' running, which is commonly used to check user permissions—innocent enough unless it's part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of conhost.exe and powershell.exe accessing registry values multiple times. These are often tools attackers use for persistence or privilege escalation. The fact that these processes are interacting with the registry could mean they're trying to leave backdoors or alter system configurations.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's a pattern of PowerShell executing removal commands and other system utilities being used. This combination suggests potential malicious activity rather than normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell removing files from the TEMP directory, along with process creation events for potentially malicious tools like whoami.exe and conhost.exe, indicate possible adversary activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously. But these seem like legitimate system files being loaded. Not sure yet, but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nNext, I notice that a file was created and then immediately deleted by powershell.exe. The file paths are in the TEMP directory, which is common for temporary scripts. The names of the files look like they might be related to some script testing or policy checks. Maybe benign, but it's worth noting because deleting temp files could be part of malicious activity trying to cover tracks.\n\nThen there's a pipeline being created by powershell.exe. Pipelines are normal in PowerShell scripting for command chaining, so that alone doesn't raise red flags, but combined with other actions, it might be significant.\n\nLooking further, I see several events where specific files in the TEMP directory are being removed using Remove-Item. The file names like 'registro_comum.txt' and others seem generic, but they could be part of a script trying to clean up after itself or removing logs. Since these are being executed from PowerShell, it's worth considering if this is part of some automated process that might have malicious intent.\n\nAnother event mentions winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That seems normal for log management tools, so probably not an issue here.\n\nThere are also multiple entries where chrome.exe sets registry values. Browsers do interact with the registry for settings, so unless there's something unusual about these events, they might not be suspicious on their own. However, seeing four such events in a row could indicate some repetitive activity worth looking into.\n\nAdditionally, whoami.exe was run, which is typically used to check user permissions or identity. In the context of system logs, this can be part of legitimate user activity or system scripts but could also be used by attackers to gather information.\n\nFinally, there's a file being created in the Downloads folder. Since it's named 'objeto_padrao.txt', which translates to something like 'default object' in Portuguese, it might just be a document downloaded by the user, so probably not suspicious unless it's unexpected.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell.exe instances performing file operations, including creating and deleting temp files; use of whoami.exe; repeated chrome.exe registry modifications. These activities could indicate script execution or potentially malicious behavior like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration. The pattern suggests some level of automation or scripting that might be trying to stay under the radar.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if all these are malicious, but there are enough red flags pointing towards possible suspicious activity that it's worth investigating further. My confidence is around 0.6 because while several indicators are present, they could also be part of legitimate system processes or misconfigured scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances performing file operations and registry changes, including deletion of temporary files and creation of new files in the TEMP directory. Additionally, repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and execution of whoami.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm supposed to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first four events, all of them are from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's an event from RuntimeBroker.exe doing a registry set. I know that RuntimeBroker is related to Windows' User Account Control (UAC) and it handles some elevation processes. But again, setting registry values isn't unusual unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNow, looking at the events involving powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The fact that it's accessing multiple processes might raise an eyebrow, especially if there are many instances. However, in this case, each access task seems isolated to process access and creation.\n\nThen there are events where whoami.exe is being executed. Whoami is a legitimate system tool used to display user information. It's commonly used by scripts or users checking their permissions. Running it once isn't suspicious, but multiple runs could indicate someone probing the environment, which might be a red flag.\n\nThe last two events stand out. One is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory, which seems normal as part of log shipping or configuration updates. But the other event involves powershell.exe creating a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in a user's Downloads folder. The filename looks suspicious—something like \"active package\" in Portuguese, possibly indicating some kind of malicious script or payload.\n\nPutting it all together: several instances of legitimate tools (chrome.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, whoami.exe) performing normal actions, but the use of powershell.exe accessing multiple processes and the creation of a file by powershell could indicate possible lateral movement or persistence. The filename 'pacote_ativo.txt' is particularly concerning as it might be part of malicious activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because while some events are common, others like the PowerShell activities and the suspicious file creation could be indicators of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and a suspicious file creation by PowerShell suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
