{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessing various tasks. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated instances might be suspicious. The command line in one event shows a script execution attempt, which stands out because scripts can execute commands that are harder to trace.\n\nLooking at the file operations, there's a file being created and then immediately deleted. This behavior could indicate an attempt to clean up evidence after executing malicious code. Also, the temporary directory location (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp) is often used for such activities, making this event more concerning.\n\nThe registry modifications in multiple events by different processes like PowerShell.exe and svchost.exe are also red flags. Malware frequently uses registry edits to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, which could be harmful.\n\nWhile some events involve legitimate system processes like RuntimeBroker.exe loading urlmon.dll, the combination of numerous PowerShell activities with file deletions and registry changes suggests potential malicious behavior. The frequency and nature of these events together raise suspicion about possible exploitation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe process creation and activity, including script execution, file operations in Temporary directory, and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where svchost.exe is creating files in the C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. The file paths look like they're part of a Windows Update process, with filenames like UpdateAgent.dll and WinREAgent.dll. Since svchost.exe is commonly associated with legitimate system processes, these might just be normal update activities.\n\nThen there's an event from backgroundTaskHost.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is also a standard file in the System32 directory. That doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, msedgewebview2.exe loading BitsProxy.dll. This seems related to Microsoft Edge or another browser using BITS for network operations, which is normal behavior.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe loading BitsProxy.dll again, consistent with update processes.\n\nThere are several registry value set events by svchost.exe without a file path. These could be part of legitimate Windows services adjusting configuration settings during updates or maintenance.\n\nFinally, there's a file creation event in the DataStore\\Logs directory for edbtmp.log, which might be related to Windows Update log files.\n\nLooking at all these together, they don't indicate any malicious activity. They all point towards normal system operations, especially related to Windows Updates and background processes. There's no unusual combination of events or signs like repeated failures, access to restricted areas, or unexpected file executions that would raise red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal system process activities related to Windows updates and background tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they're all FileCreate tasks from svchost.exe. The file paths are under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download. That seems normal because Windows Update uses these directories for downloading updates. So those might be legitimate activities.\n\nThen there are several Registry value sets by svchost.exe. Again, svchost is a common system process, so writing to the registry isn't suspicious on its own. It's probably part of update-related tasks.\n\nNext, I see events from MpSigStub.exe and MsMpEng.exe. These relate to Windows Defender processes. They're creating files in temporary directories and loading DLLs. That sounds normal for antivirus updates or scans.\n\nThere are also some FileCreate events from setup.exe in the Microsoft Edge directory. It's installing or updating components, which is expected behavior during updates or installations.\n\nI don't notice any signs of malicious activity here. All processes involved are standard system files performing common tasks related to updates and security. No unusual file paths, excessive writes, or unexpected registry modifications that would raise a red flag.\n\nSo considering the entire batch together, there's nothing out of place. The events are consistent with normal Windows operations and updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes like svchost.exe performing standard tasks such as file creation and registry modifications related to updates, as well as legitimate antivirus activities from MpSigStub.exe and MsMpEng.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first two entries are from 'setup.exe' creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. That seems normal because setup.exe is commonly used for software installations, so I don't see anything suspicious here.\n\nNext, there's an entry from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' modifying a registry value. Runtime Broker is part of Windows User Mode Helper Services and usually handles user sessions, so this activity is typical and not alarming.\n\nThen, I see multiple events involving 'powershell.exe'. The first one shows it being accessed, which isn't unusual since PowerShell is a common tool. However, there's an event where PowerShell creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a BinaryPath pointing to a .exe file in a path like C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum... That looks a bit concerning because creating a new service could be part of malicious activity, especially if the binary path is to an unknown or suspicious executable.\n\nMoreover, there's a command line that includes \"New-Service\" and \"Start-Service\", which are legitimate PowerShell cmdlets. But the fact that it's being used to create a new service with specific parameters might raise flags if this activity isn't expected. Also, after creating the service, there's a file creation in the Temp directory followed by its deletion, which could be an attempt to hide malicious code or test permissions.\n\nThe subsequent entries show PowerShell loading various DLLs and accessing files. While some of these are normal for script execution, others might indicate malicious behavior if they're accessing restricted areas or loading unexpected modules.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated Registry modifications from 'services.exe'. Normally, services.exe is part of Windows Service Control Manager, but multiple registry writes could be a sign of tampering with system settings, possibly by malware trying to persistence.\n\nLooking at the last two events, 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading some DLLs. The name translates to \"logical task\" in Portuguese, which isn't inherently malicious, but without knowing more about this file's origin and purpose, it could be suspicious if it's not a known process.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: creating new services with potentially harmful binaries, repeated registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell to execute scripts that might have malicious intent. These activities, especially when combined, suggest possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior in the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events related to potentially suspicious activity, such as creating a new service with 'New-Service' and starting it, along with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories which could indicate malicious script execution. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications by services.exe and the creation of a custom service named \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" with an associated binary path pointing to a non-standard location.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each with process, winlog, and file information.\n\nFirst, the events start with \"tarefa_logico.exe\" loading some .NET framework DLLs. That's normal for an executable needing those libraries to run. So that's not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Powershell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's creating a new file might be something to look into, but sometimes scripts do this as part of their setup.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where winlog shows \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That stands out because executing remote commands can be a red flag in cybersecurity—often used by attackers to execute code on remote systems. The paths in the file field point to PS1 files, which are powershell scripts. Having multiple such events could indicate repeated attempts or part of a script's execution.\n\nLooking further, there are several events with complex command lines invoking powershell.exe and importing modules from specific paths. These commands seem to be trying to import a module and then execute some functions like Invoke-entrada_principal, which isn't a standard cmdlet, so it might be custom or malicious code. The use of try-catch blocks suggests they're handling exceptions, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nI also notice that the same command is repeated multiple times. This repetition could indicate an automated script being run in a loop, which might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it continues running after reboots or interruptions.\n\nAdditionally, there are attempts to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using powershell.exe. Creating new services is another common tactic for attackers to establish persistence on a system. Services can run at startup and can be hard to detect if they're blended in with legitimate ones.\n\nThe use of specific paths like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\\" seems arbitrary, which might make it less likely to be part of standard software operation. Legitimate software often follows more conventional directory structures, so this could indicate an attempt to hide or place files where they're not commonly looked for.\n\nConsidering the combination of all these events: multiple powershell executions, remote command execution attempts, service creation, and repeated script imports from non-standard paths—it paints a picture that's concerning. These activities don't seem to be part of normal system operations. Instead, they align with behaviors often associated with malware or attack campaigns, such as persistence, lateral movement, and hiding malicious processes.\n\nI'm also noticing the lack of file writes except for specific cases—powershell is being used in a way that doesn't leave many footprints beyond logs, which might be intentional to avoid detection. The sleep command in the script suggests some form of timing or waiting, possibly to evade real-time monitoring systems.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events could be benign, the combination and repetition point towards something more malicious. This batch likely warrants further investigation because there's a high probability that these actions are part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing scripts from unusual paths, creating services, and attempting remote command execution suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries where a PowerShell command is executed. The command creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path. This seems suspicious because creating services can be a way for malware to persist on a system.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where remote commands are being executed from a file located at C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1. The fact that the same script is called multiple times makes me think it's part of an automated or malicious process.\n\nThere's also an event involving services.exe, which is associated with the Windows Service Control Manager. Malware often uses legitimate tools like this to hide its activities or gain persistence.\n\nConsidering all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell for service creation and remote command execution from a script file raises red flags. This combination could indicate malicious activity such as creating persistent backdoors or installing malware components. The volume of similar events adds to the suspicion that this isn't just normal system administration but something more nefarious.\n\nI'm confident enough, given the patterns, to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to create a service and execute remote scripts, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that every single event has the same structure. The \"process\" field is always \"None\", which might mean there’s no associated process or maybe it wasn’t captured. Then, in the \"winlog\" field, each event shows a task of 'Execute a Remote Command'. That sounds like someone is trying to run a command remotely on the system.\n\nLooking at the file paths under the \"file\" field, they all point to 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. Wait, that's a PowerShell script. I remember that malicious actors often use PS scripts for executing commands because they can be obfuscated or have persistence features.\n\nSo, if multiple events are showing the same remote command execution on the same file, this could indicate repeated attempts to run that script. Maybe it's part of a larger attack, like a script dropped by another process or an ongoing attempt to execute malicious code. The repetition might suggest something is off because legitimate scripts usually don't get executed repeatedly in such a short time.\n\nI'm also thinking about the context of 'Execute a Remote Command'. If this were part of normal operations, I wouldn’t expect so many identical events. It could be someone testing the system or trying to execute malicious code multiple times, which would raise red flags.\n\nThe path looks like it's in Portuguese: \"unidade_logico\" (logical unit), \"registro_secundario\" (secondary registry?), and \"componente_auxiliar\" (auxiliary component). Not sure if that's meaningful or just part of the filename. Either way, having a script named 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' being executed remotely could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, 14 events in a row with the same remote command execution on the same file is definitely interesting. It shows unusual activity that might indicate an attack or at least something worth investigating further. So I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because of the repetitive and potentially malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events showing repeated remote command execution on a PowerShell script, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
