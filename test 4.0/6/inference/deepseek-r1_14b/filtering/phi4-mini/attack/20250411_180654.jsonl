{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a PowerShell process creating a file named \"objeto_temporario.txt\". That caught my eye because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Creating a temporary file isn't necessarily bad, but it could be part of something more nefarious like data exfiltration or setting up persistence.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome can make changes to the registry for updates or settings, repeated writes might indicate some kind of monitoring or unwanted behavior. I should consider whether these are normal updates or if they're part of a larger attack vector.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is run with no arguments. Whoami itself isn't harmful, but running it in isolation could be a way to check user permissions or gather information about the system. If this happens alongside other suspicious activities, it might be relevant.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances where PowerShell processes are accessing registry keys and loading DLLs. This is concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for executing malicious scripts. The command lines I see reference .ps1 files in various paths, which makes me think these could be scripts meant to capture keystrokes or other system information. That definitely raises a red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple such events with slightly different file paths suggests a pattern. Attackers might use similar techniques across different locations to avoid detection. The repeated \"RegistryEvent\" tasks from chrome.exe also seem out of place and could be part of an adversarial activity trying to blend in with normal behavior.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's clear that there are multiple indicators pointing towards potential malicious activities. The combination of PowerShell executions with command-line arguments pointing to scripts, temporary file creation, registry modifications, and repeated process accesses makes this batch particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events involving powershell.exe accessing files and running potentially malicious scripts, along with chrome.exe making repeated registry changes. Indicators include the creation of temporary files, execution of whoami.exe, and several process access events which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The user has provided a list of JSONL entries, each with process, winlog, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries involve powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. Looking deeper, several processes have command lines pointing to different paths with filenames like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious—it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is definitely something a cyber attacker would do.\n\nThe tasks in the winlog entries vary, but I see things like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, and Registry value set. These are normal for Powershell as it starts up and interacts with system components, so on their own they're not too concerning. However, combined with the command lines, they might indicate that a script is being executed multiple times or in different contexts.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was deleted (File Delete logged), which could be part of cleaning up traces after malicious activity. Additionally, several File Create events from powershell.exe writing to various locations could be part of the attack process—maybe dropping files or creating temporary scripts.\n\nI'm noticing that some command lines are similar but with varying paths. For example, different directories like C:\\registro_ativo\\tarefa_temporario\\... and others are used. This might suggest that the attacker is trying to spread out their activities to avoid detection or to ensure persistence across different locations.\n\nAnother point is that there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating files in a Downloads folder. While this could be normal, especially if someone is setting up monitoring tools, the fact that it's paired with multiple Powershell events makes me wonder if it's part of legitimate admin work or something more nefarious.\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines and tasks makes me think there's a pattern here—maybe an automated script running multiple times, possibly testing different methods or locations. The Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script is particularly concerning because keystroke loggers are a common tool for attackers to gather sensitive information like passwords or other inputs.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level. While each individual event might not be highly suspicious on its own, the combination of multiple Powershell executions with potentially malicious scripts and file operations raises the risk. The confidence isn't super high because without more context (like timestamps showing rapid-fire events), it's hard to say definitively, but the indicators are enough to warrant closer investigation.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch shows a series of activities that could be part of a cyberattack involving Powershell scripts for persistence and data collection. The multiple instances and varying paths suggest possible evasion techniques or broader lateral movement within the system. Therefore, I classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which may indicate keylogging activity. File creation and deletion events suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
