{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being accessed. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The command line in one event shows that it's downloading something from GitHub. That URL looks suspicious—WinPwn.ps1 sounds like it could be part of a known exploit or malware.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, which is normal because scripts load various DLLs. But the files being loaded seem okay at first glance. However, later on, there's a FileDeleteDetected event where a temp file is deleted after running some script. That could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows whoami.exe being run without any command line arguments. While not inherently suspicious, it might be part of reconnaissance to check user privileges or system info.\n\nLooking further, there are some Registry value sets by powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Registyr changes can indicate persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. Svchost is usually legitimate but can sometimes be used by malware.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for sppsvc.exe, which might not be suspicious on its own. But considering the other events, it could be part of an exploit chain.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell running scripts from GitHub, file deletions, registry modifications—these are red flags. The repeated ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks suggest a prolonged activity, possibly setting up persistence or deploying malware.\n\nSo yeah, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation because the combination points to potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe downloading from GitHub, file deletions, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of logs to see if it's something I should look into. First off, all these events are related to PowerShell.exe activities on a system. That's already interesting because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing processes, modifying registry values, and loading images. Then I notice that in event number 3, there's a command line argument that stands out: it's trying to create a new PowerShell drive with a target of \\\\Target\\C$. This seems like an attempt to access another machine, which might be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nMoving further down, events show file creations and deletions. Specifically, the script creates a temporary .ps1 file and then deletes it shortly after. This behavior is common in malware to avoid detection by cleaning up traces. The deletion happening right after creation raises suspicion because legitimate scripts might not always delete their own files immediately.\n\nThe key moment comes in event 14: the command line clearly shows an attempt to download a script from a GitHub repository using a WebClient object and execute it with sensitive parameters like 'sensitivefiles'. This is a big red flag. The URL points to a known repository associated with malicious activities, which makes this particularly concerning.\n\nMoreover, I see multiple events (14-17) repeating the same command line. This repetition suggests that the script is being executed multiple times or in a loop, which could indicate an attempt to persist the infection or ensure the payload runs successfully despite some failures.\n\nPutting it all together: PowerShell activities with process access, registry modifications, file downloads and execution from untrusted sources, coupled with attempts to delete evidence—these are classic signs of malicious behavior. The repeated downloading and execution of a script known for malicious purposes further solidifies that this batch is indeed concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, modifying registry values, loading images, creating files, and executing scripts from potentially malicious sources. Notably, one event shows an attempt to download a script from a known repository associated with malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events show PowerShell commands downloading something from GitHub. The command line is executing an expression that downloads a script from 'https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...'. That URL looks suspicious because it's pointing to a public repository, and the script name WinPown.ps1 sounds like it could be malicious. I know that PowerShell scripts downloaded from such sources are often used in attacks, so this is a red flag.\n\nNext, looking at the 'winlog' field, some events have tasks related to 'Provider Lifecycle' and others to 'Engine Lifecycle'. These seem like system-level events but combined with the PowerShell command, they could indicate something malicious is being executed.\n\nThen there are several events where the process command line is about creating a new PS drive: \"New-PSDrive -name g...\". This seems odd because it's trying to map a drive using an auxiliary unit \"\\Target\\C$\". Using such a syntax might be attempting to access another system or volume, which could be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nAfter those, there are events where the 'process' is None and the 'winlog' task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. This makes me think that perhaps some remote execution is happening without a visible process, maybe via WMI or another method. The repetition of this event multiple times suggests it's part of a sequence.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious scripts, drive mappings to possibly external systems, and repeated attempts to execute remote commands. These are all indicators that could point towards malicious activity like script downloading, persistence mechanisms, and lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe fact that several events repeat the same command lines also raises suspicion—it might be an attempt to ensure the payload is running or part of a larger campaign. The use of GitHub for script download adds another layer because it's a common place for attackers to host malicious scripts while maintaining some level of anonymity.\n\nConsidering the confidence, I'm fairly certain that this batch shows signs of potential attack activities. The combination of downloading scripts and executing remote commands is consistent with typical intrusion behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell commands attempting to download a script from a suspicious GitHub repository, create PS drives, and execute remote commands, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system events that the user provided. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Let's break down what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, every single event has \"process\": \"None\". That suggests that there's no associated process information, which might mean the logs aren't capturing the actual executable or command being run. Then, looking at the \"winlog\" field, each one has a task of 'Execute a Remote Command'. That task usually indicates some kind of remote execution activity on the system.\n\nThe \"file\" field is also \"None\" in all cases, so there's no file path or name associated with these events. This could mean that whatever is being executed isn't tied to a specific file, maybe it's something in-memory or using another method.\n\nNow, considering all four events together, the repetition stands out. If one user executed a remote command once, seeing multiple identical entries might just be part of their workflow. But four times in a row raises a red flag. Malware often uses repeated actions to establish persistence or carry out attacks. It's possible that this could be an attempt at unauthorized access or something malicious trying to run.\n\nI'm also thinking about the context of these logs. If this is from a single user or device, it might indicate that the system is being targeted, especially since there's no file involved—malicious actors sometimes avoid writing files to evade detection. Alternatively, if these are spread across different devices, maybe it's a broader campaign.\n\nI need to assess the confidence level here. While each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the combination of four identical remote command executions is concerning. There's a reasonable chance that this activity is malicious or at least deserving of further investigation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the repeated attempts to execute remote commands without associated files or processes are red flags for potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events indicating repeated attempts to execute a remote command with no associated file or process information, suggesting possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
