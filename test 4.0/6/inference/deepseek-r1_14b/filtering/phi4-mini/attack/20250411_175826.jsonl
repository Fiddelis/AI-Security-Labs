{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting or not. I'm looking for signs of malicious behavior across all events.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That's normal since Chrome handles a lot of network activity. No red flags there.\n\nThen, powershell.exe appears several times. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines in the logs show some interesting patterns. For example:\n- There are attempts to modify file last write times using \"Get-ChildItem\" and setting dates back to 1970.\n- Files like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1\" are created and then deleted, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by removing evidence.\n- Multiple Registry modifications with SetValue might indicate attempts to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAlso, the use of \"whoami.exe\" could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation, though in this case it's just running without suspicious arguments. The repeated creation and deletion of files along with registry changes under powershell's command line are concerning. These activities often correlate with malicious scripts trying to cover their tracks or deploying payloads.\n\nThe last few entries have command lines that seem to be obfuscated or part of a larger script execution. The file paths and patterns (like \"modulo_logico\", \"registro_base\") suggest they're targeting specific system components, possibly indicating an attempt to manipulate system structures or hide malicious code within legitimate directories.\n\nTaking all these points into account, the combination of powershell's suspicious activities, file manipulation, registry changes, and repeated attempts to alter file timestamps are indicators that this batch is indeed worth investigating. The confidence level is high because multiple events point towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities, including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and attempts to set LastWriteTime on files to an old date (1\/1\/1970). These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or data tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, I've got a bunch of log events here in JSONL format. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all seem similar. They're powershell.exe processes with command lines that involve Get-ChildItem on various paths and then setting LastWriteTime to 1970. That date is a common epoch time, often used in attacks to hide file changes because it's before most systems were tracking timestamps accurately. So this could be an attempt to manipulate file times, possibly to cover tracks after modifying files.\n\nNext, there are events where svchost.exe sets registry values. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process but can be abused by malware. The fact that it's making changes to the registry might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other activities, it could indicate something fishy.\n\nThen I see Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator isn't expected to load this DLL, which is related to URL handling. It could be a sign of a process being injected or a malicious payload using legitimate processes for execution.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. This might seem normal at first glance since Defender uses PowerShell, but sometimes attackers replace genuine files with malicious ones in these directories. So this could be an attempt to masquerade as legitimate antivirus activity.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. This is concerning because startup scripts can be used to maintain persistence across reboots. Creating such a file might indicate setting up a persistent backdoor or malicious script.\n\nThere's also an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so this might not be suspicious unless it's being used inappropriately. However, given the other events, I have to consider if this tool is part of a larger attack vector.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe entries show registry modifications. While Chrome does update its settings through registry changes, doing so repeatedly without cause could indicate tampering or an attempt to modify browser settings for malicious purposes, like redirecting searches or installing unwanted extensions.\n\nPutting it all together: several instances of powershell.exe with potentially suspicious command lines, manipulation of file times and registry entries by both legitimate and suspicious processes, and unexpected DLL loads. These activities collectively point towards possible malicious behavior. The combination suggests an attacker might be attempting to execute commands, modify system configurations, hide their tracks, and establish persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of events doesn't align with normal user activity. However, I'm not 100% certain since some actions like svchost.exe or chrome.exe registry changes could be legitimate in some cases. But considering the multiple powershell activities and file manipulations, it's more likely indicative of a security event.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes with command lines that set LastWriteTime to 1970 on various files, which may indicate an attempt to manipulate file timestamps. Additionally, there are registry modifications and unexpected DLL loads, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event says.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe. Some of them show that ImageLoad was triggered for amsi.dll in the System32 folder. Hmm, amsi.dll is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface, so it's part of Windows' own security features. That doesn't immediately seem suspicious because legitimate processes might interact with it.\n\nThen there are several events where chrome.exe is setting registry values via RegistryEvent. I know that programs often write to the registry for configuration purposes, so this could be normal. But multiple such events from the same process in a row might be worth looking into—maybe it's trying to set several registry keys in quick succession.\n\nLooking at other processes: winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own directory with a .yml extension. That seems legitimate since winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log management, so creating config files makes sense.\n\nPowershell.exe created a file named 'unidade_logico.txt' which translates to something like 'logical unit'. Powershell is often used for scripting and can be both legitimate and malicious. The filename isn't obviously suspicious, but I should consider the context. If this was part of an automated process or user action, it might not be bad.\n\nWait a second—multiple chrome.exe events are modifying the registry repeatedly. That could indicate something like persistence mechanisms where malware tries to set registry entries to ensure it starts on boot. But since these are all from chrome.exe, which is a legitimate application, that doesn't add up. Unless there's a compromised Chrome instance or some extension doing this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of normal operations for Chrome, but I'm not sure how often it would write to the registry. It might be worth checking if these registry writes are related to extensions or updates.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of chrome.exe activity with both file and registry changes, plus some expected actions from other processes like winlogbeat and powershell. The potential red flag is the repeated RegistryEvent tasks by Chrome, which could suggest something malicious, but without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI think this batch might be interesting enough for further investigation because of the unusual number of registry writes from Chrome, even though other events seem normal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple RegistryEvent tasks by chrome.exe may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
