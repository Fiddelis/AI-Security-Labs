Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal; it's often used just to check user information, so not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext up are several events related to powershell.exe. The command line in some of these shows a script that uses findstr and select-string with patterns like \"pass\" across various file types. This looks like it's searching for sensitive information, which could be part of an attack to extract credentials or other sensitive data. That definitely raises a red flag.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe accesses files and loads images. The specific files mentioned, like mscoreei.dll and MpOAV.dll, seem legitimate, but the repeated access might indicate something more malicious, especially since they're part of known frameworks and security tools. Maybe the attacker is using these modules for their own purposes.\n\nI notice a file being created and then deleted in the same script path. Temporary files created and immediately deleted could be an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic in malware. That adds to the suspicion.\n\nLooking further, there are events from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That's part of their logging setup, so it's probably benign unless it's misused elsewhere.\n\nThere are also some registry modifications by svchost.exe, which is a common system process. However, changes here can be malicious if they're altering known exploit points or service configurations. Without more context, this could be something to watch but not necessarily alarming on its own.\n\nLastly, calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll are normal as these are standard processes using DLLs for functionality.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated powershell.exe activities with suspicious command lines and file operations suggest potential malicious behavior. The use of scripts searching for sensitive data and creating\/destroying temporary files are concerning signs. While some events might be legitimate, the combination points towards an attack or unauthorized activity that's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing potentially malicious commands targeting sensitive file types, combined with suspicious file creation and deletion patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: It's OfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query. That seems normal since Office applications often access online services or check for updates. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command being executed. The command line has 'findstr' looking for the word \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc., and then using Select-String with the pattern \"password\". That looks concerning because it seems like it's searching for password information. This could be an attempt to harvest credentials.\n\nThen there's a file creation by PowerShell under the user's AppData directory. It's creating a profile data file. I'm not sure if that's malicious, but combined with the previous event, it might indicate some kind of persistence or data collection.\n\nLooking at Chrome events: There are DNS queries and network connections, which aren't unusual. Also, loading system DLLs like amsi.dll is normal for Windows processes. The Registry changes could be part of normal operation too, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file, which makes sense if it's the agent logging these events. No problem there.\n\nThen I see whoami.exe being run with no arguments. That's typically used to get user information, but in isolation, it's benign unless part of a larger attack.\n\nNext is cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks. The command lines show deletion of specific task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\". This could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or clean up traces of previous activities. If these tasks were legitimate, this might be suspicious, but without knowing the context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command that deletes two more scheduled tasks. Again, this behavior is something a malicious actor might do to remove their own tools from the system or remove competition.\n\nThere are multiple events of powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes, which could be part of normal operations but also could indicate command execution for malicious purposes.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe deleting notepad.exe process. Using WMIC can be a red flag because it's often used in remote attacks to execute commands. Deleting Notepad might seem innocent, but the use of WMIC here raises concerns about potential remote control or lateral movement.\n\nPutting all this together: There are several red flags like the PowerShell command searching for passwords, deletion of scheduled tasks via cmd and schtasks, and using WMIC for process deletion. These actions could be indicative of a cyberattack where an attacker is trying to cover their tracks or escalate privileges. The combination suggests potential malicious activity rather than normal system operations.\n\nI'm moderately confident in this assessment because while some events might not be suspicious on their own, the pattern of behavior across multiple processes and commands leans towards something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as PowerShell command execution attempting to search for passwords, deletion of scheduled tasks using cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, and use of WMIC.exe which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each event has a process, winlog task, and file info. Let me try to parse through them one by one.\n\nFirst, the first event shows WMIC.exe loading a DLL file related to Windows Defender. That could be suspicious because WMIC is often used in attacks. But sometimes it's legitimate too, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several cmd.exe and powershell.exe processes. For example, cmd.exe deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". Deleting user accounts might indicate an attempt to remove traces or elevate privileges. The command lines show deletion commands, which could be part of a cleanup after some malicious activity.\n\nThere's also net.exe and net1.exe being used to delete users across the domain, which is more concerning because it affects multiple systems. These are legitimate tools but can be misused for large-scale attacks.\n\nI notice that whoami.exe is run, which is often used to check user permissions or credentials. This could be part of reconnaissance to see what user the process is running under.\n\nThere's a command deleting a service with sc.exe: 'sc delete win32times'. That might be an attempt to disable monitoring services, which would be a red flag as it could hide malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the file paths and DLLs, MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender's MP engine. If it's being loaded by WMIC.exe, that could indicate an exploit or persistence mechanism.\n\nPowershell.exe is accessed multiple times without obvious commands in these logs, but powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The fact that it's accessed several times might be part of a script execution or payload delivery.\n\nThe events also involve registry changes with RegistryEvent tasks. Modifying the registry could be setting up persistence points or changing system configurations to allow further attacks.\n\nFinally, there are attempts to delete temporary files in %temp%, which suggests some process was creating files there and then trying to clean up evidence. This is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of user deletions across systems, service deletion, potential exploit via WMIC.exe, powershell accesses without clear commands, registry modifications, and cleanup of temporary files. These activities collectively look like they could be part of an attack chain—reconnaissance, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential dumping, etc.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the combination of these events suggests malicious behavior rather than normal operations. The repeated use of command-line tools for deletions and system changes without obvious legitimate reasons adds to the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities, including user deletions across domains, service removals, potential exploit attempts via WMIC.exe, and registry modifications. These actions suggest possible malicious behavior or attack chain activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see a cmd.exe process deleting a file. That might be suspicious because legitimate programs usually don't delete files on their own, especially if it's happening in the Temp directory. So that catches my attention.\n\nThen there are multiple events involving whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but when combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger script or malicious process. The fact that whoami.exe is being created multiple times might indicate something's off—maybe an automated script running it several times.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell activity, there are several events: Process Create, accessed, Image loaded, and file operations. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious purposes like downloading files or executing commands. The fact that there are multiple ImageLoad tasks suggests that powershell is loading various modules or components, which could be part of normal operation, but in this case, combined with other events, it might indicate something more.\n\nI notice a file being created and then deleted by powershell.exe. Creating temporary files isn't unusual, but deleting them immediately after creation, especially if they have obfuscated names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1, could be an attempt to hide evidence or prevent detection.\n\nThe repeated use of processes like cmd.exe and whoami.exe, along with the powershell activities, makes me think there's a potential script running multiple commands. This could be part of a larger attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows suspicious file deletions and multiple process creations involving tools often used in attacks. The repeated attempts to create processes and the file operations might indicate an ongoing malicious activity rather than normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving suspicious activities, including cmd.exe deleting a file, whoami.exe being executed multiple times, and PowerShell processes with file creation and deletion.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm supposed to analyze them as a whole and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first two events show processes named 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe', both loading the same file: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll'. That seems a bit odd because Calculator typically doesn't need URL monitoring, but maybe it's part of normal operations? I'm not sure yet.\n\n2. The third event is about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file in a specific directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for log management, so this might be expected behavior if it's installed and running.\n\n3. Then there's an event from 'powershell.exe' accessing something without a file path. Powershell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities, but not all activities are malicious. I'll need to see if the action here is normal or suspicious.\n\n4. The next four events are all from 'chrome.exe', showing DNS queries and network connections. Browsers do this regularly when navigating, so these might just be standard user activity unless there's something unusual about the domains visited.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch together:\n\n- I see multiple entries for calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That could indicate a possible issue because having two different calculator processes both accessing the same DLL might not be normal. Maybe it's part of an exploit or persistence mechanism?\n\n- The powershell event stands out because it's accessing something without referencing a file, which is a bit vague. Powershell can do many things, so I need to think if this access is typical for the user or environment.\n\n- The chrome events are all about network activity and DNS queries. Unless these are pointing to known malicious domains, they might not be suspicious. But since I don't have the specific URLs, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it together, there's a mix of normal activities (chrome, winlogbeat) and some potentially concerning ones with powershell and multiple calc processes. The confidence level isn't super high because I can't confirm malicious intent from just these logs, but there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show unusual process activity including powershell.exe and duplicate calculator processes accessing the same file. This combination raises suspicion of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
