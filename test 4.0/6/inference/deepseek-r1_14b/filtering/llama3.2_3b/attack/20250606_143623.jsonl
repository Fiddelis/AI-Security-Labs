{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries that detail various system processes and actions. My goal is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if there's any indication of malicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe being executed. That seems pretty normal because it's often used by legitimate processes to check user information. It doesn't raise any red flags for me, but I'll keep an eye out in case other events tie back to this.\n\nNext up are a couple of powershell.exe entries where the process is accessed. Powershell can be tricky because while it's a powerful tool for system admins, it's also commonly used by attackers. The command line in one of these events shows some interesting PowerShell commands: creating a new service with specific names and paths. Let me parse that. The command is trying to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\" which translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese. That seems suspicious, especially because the binary path points to an unusual location: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. I'm not sure what that path refers to, but it looks like a custom or potentially malicious service is being set up.\n\nThen there's a series of events where powershell.exe is accessing various files and registry entries. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1) catches my attention. Creating and then deleting scripts quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection, which is a common tactic in malware. Also, the file paths for these actions are under a user's AppData folder, which isn't typical for legitimate scripts running during normal operations.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where services.exe and svchost.exe are modifying registry values. Services.exe can be part of legitimate system operations, but repeated writes to the registry could indicate an attempt to install or modify service configurations. Given that one of these processes (tarefa_logico.exe) loaded .NET framework DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell scripts, but combined with the earlier script creation and deletion, it adds up.\n\nAnother point is the setup.exe creating multiple files under the EdgeCore directory. While this could be part of a legitimate update or installation, the fact that other processes are modifying services and registry entries around the same time makes me wonder if there's more to it.\n\nPutting all these pieces together: unusual PowerShell commands, creation\/deletion of temporary scripts, multiple registry modifications, and creating a custom service with potentially malicious binaries. These activities collectively suggest possible malicious behavior. The combination of using powershell.exe for script execution, service creation with an uncommon name, quick file deletions, and registry tampering are all red flags that could indicate an attack.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of events doesn't align with typical user or system activity. The high number of process creations and modifications, especially involving known attack vectors like PowerShell, make it worth investigating further. My confidence is pretty high (around 0.8) because while some individual actions could be benign, the sequence and combination point towards potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activities such as creating a new service with unusual naming, executing powershell.exe commands that may indicate scripting for persistence or privilege escalation, and modifying registry entries.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that many entries involve processes like setup.exe and svchost.exe performing file creation and registry modifications. Setup.exe is commonly associated with software installations, so these could be normal during an update or installation. The specific files created under Microsoft Edge's directory seem legitimate.\n\nLooking at the events involving svchost.exe creating temporary files in Windows Temp and AppReadiness directories aligns with typical system operations, as svchost is a known process for various services.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe runs a command that simply writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. The use of -ExecutionPolicy Restricted suggests it's running under some controlled environment, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of system administration tasks.\n\nI don't see any overt signs of malicious activity like unusual file paths, suspicious process names, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks. All activities seem to fit within normal system operations and software installations.\n\nWhile it's always good to monitor for anomalies, the events here don't raise red flags collectively.

Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events are related to powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's being called multiple times might be significant. Looking at the command line in one of the events, there's a script that's checking for .inf files and looking for specific patterns. That could be part of system configuration changes or possibly something malicious trying to identify certain drivers or components.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad tasks, which indicate that powershell is loading various DLLs. This isn't inherently suspicious, but the combination with other actions might raise a flag. The creation of files in temporary directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp suggests that powershell is generating some scripts or modules there. Temporary script creation can be part of normal operation, but it's also a common tactic for malicious scripts to drop and execute from temp folders.\n\nThen there are events involving whoami.exe and cmd.exe with Dism commands. The Dism command being used here is interesting because it's typically used for enabling or disabling Windows features. The command \"\/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender\" stands out—it looks like someone is trying to disable Windows Defender, which could be an attempt to lower the system's security posture. Disabling antivirus can be a precursor to malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the process events, there are multiple powershell instances and also Dism.exe running with some file operations. The FileExecutableDetected tasks on Dism.exe loading those DLLs might indicate that something is being executed outside of normal processes, especially since one of them is AssocProvider.dll, which could be related to changing file associations—a common technique in persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions with specific command lines, creation of temporary files, and attempts to disable security features. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity. The use of Dism to disable Defender is particularly concerning because it's a critical security component. Additionally, the powershell script parsing .inf files could be trying to identify system configurations that might allow for further exploitation or persistence.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting due to these red flags. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context or deeper analysis of each file and process, but based on the given data, it's a clear indication of possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious activities, including disabling Windows Defender and script generation in temporary directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object with process info, Windows log details, and file info. The same process name 'Dism.exe' appears in every event, which I recognize as a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment services like DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management). \n\nThe tasks are mostly about files being created or detected as executables. Specifically, the first event is about a file creation, and the rest are executable detections. The paths all lead to temporary directories with various .dll.mui files. These seem like standard resources used by Windows for localization and dynamic content.\n\nSince DISM.exe is an expected process on Windows systems, especially during setup or updates, these events don't raise any red flags. There's no indication of unusual file names or locations that might suggest malicious activity. All the files detected are within the temporary directory structure typical for such operations.\n\nNo signs of unauthorized access, encryption, or data exfiltration are present here.

Let me start by analyzing each event.\n\nFirst, the initial events are all from 'Dism.exe' and mention \"File Executable Detected\". The file paths point to various .dll files in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. This seems like standard Windows operations since Dism is related to system image management, so these could be legitimate.\n\nThen there's an event where 'DismHost.exe' is created with a specific command line that includes a GUID. This looks like it's part of a normal process for some system operation or update. The subsequent events show this process loading additional .dll files from the same temp directory.\n\nI notice that all these activities are happening in a temporary folder, which is typical during installations or updates as software extracts necessary components there. Since Dism and DismHost are standard Windows tools used for deployment and servicing of Windows images, their activity shouldn't be suspicious on its own.\n\nNo signs of unusual file names, access to restricted areas, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate malicious behavior. Everything points to legitimate system processes.\n\nSo, considering the entire batch, these events don't raise any red flags. They seem to be part of a normal Windows operation, possibly an update or system maintenance task.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file operations by Dism.exe and DismHost.exe during a normal Windows process, such as updating or servicing the system image.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is that all these events are related to processes involving DismHost.exe and Dism.exe. I know that DismHost.exe is part of the Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool, which is used for managing image files like those in Windows PE environments.\n\nLooking at the individual events, there's a series where DismHost.exe is loading various DLLs into memory. Each of these DLLs has a path that points to a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. The filenames include things like LogProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, IntlProvider.dll, etc. This seems normal because DISM often uses these providers during image servicing operations.\n\nThen, towards the end, there are events where Dism.exe is deleting files from that same temporary directory. Each delete event corresponds to one of those DLLs and their associated .mui files for localization. So far, this looks like part of a typical DISM operation—loading necessary components into memory and then cleaning up after they're done.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity here. All the processes are running under standard user accounts, and the actions being logged (image loading and file deletions) are expected during a normal DISM operation, especially if this is part of an image servicing task or Windows update process.\n\nThe fact that all these events are happening in quick succession and target temporary files suggests it's a legitimate cleanup process. There's no evidence of unusual file paths, use of elevated privileges beyond what's typical for DISM, or any signs of persistence mechanisms that would indicate malware.\n\nWhile it's always good to be cautious with system processes, especially those involving image management which can sometimes be tricky, in this case, the pattern matches expected behavior. So I wouldn't flag these events as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process and Context:**\n   - The logs involve DismHost.exe and Dism.exe, both part of Windows' DISM tool used for image management.\n\n2. **Analyze Events:**\n   - Multiple events show DLLs being loaded into memory by DismHost.exe from a temporary directory.\n   - Subsequent events log the deletion of these files and their associated .mui files by Dism.exe.\n\n3. **Determine Legitimacy:**\n   - Loading providers is normal during DISM operations.\n   - Cleanup of temporary files after completion is expected behavior.\n\n4. **Assess for Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No unauthorized access or elevated privileges are indicated.\n   - File paths and actions align with standard DISM processes.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - These events represent a legitimate operation, likely part of image servicing or updates, without signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe logs indicate a legitimate DISM process involving the loading and subsequent cleanup of necessary components, without evidence of malicious activity. The events are normal and not indicative of a security threat.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"indicator\": {\n    \"type\": \"legitimate_process\",\n    \"description\": \"Events represent normal DISM operations.\"\n  },\n  \"confidence_level\": \"low\",\n  \"suggested_action\": \"No action required; this is expected behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system events. Each event is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst off, the process key consistently shows 'Dism.exe'. Dism is known to be related to Windows Deployment Services, so it's part of legitimate Windows operations. That makes me think these aren't malicious at first glance, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNext, the winlog field in each event indicates a file deletion was logged under the rule 'FileDeleteDetected'. This means the system detected that a file was deleted. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, it's plausible that it's performing these deletions as part of its normal operations. For example, during setup or deployment, temporary files might be cleaned up.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are located in the same directory: 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some GUID]\\en-US\\'. The filenames vary but seem to be DLLs with .mui extensions and a couple without. These look like resource files used by Windows for localization. It's common for deployment tools to create temporary files here, especially during updates or installations.\n\nSince all events are from the same process and point to similar file deletions in a temp directory, it doesn't raise any red flags. Malware typically would exhibit more varied behavior, such as deleting non-temporary files or accessing different directories. Also, Dism.exe is signed by Microsoft, which adds to my confidence that this isn't malicious.\n\nI should also consider the number of events. There are 14 entries all showing deletions from the same process. If this were part of a legitimate update or cleanup, it's reasonable. However, if there were only one or two such events, I might be more suspicious, but in bulk like this, it seems consistent with normal operations.\n\nAnother point is that each event is an individual file deletion. Dism.exe handling multiple files as part of its process isn't unusual. It's possible that during deployment, several temporary files are being cleaned up.\n\nI'm also thinking about the possibility of logspamming or other malicious activities trying to mimic legitimate processes. However, the consistency in the logs and the nature of the files involved make this less likely. Additionally, if it were a large-scale attack, I would expect more varied timestamps or other anomalies, which aren't present here.\n\nIn summary, while file deletion events can sometimes be concerning, the context provided by Dism.exe and the specific file paths strongly suggest these are legitimate actions taken during normal Windows operations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system events involves 'Dism.exe' deleting multiple files from a temporary directory. These deletions are likely part of legitimate Windows deployment or cleanup processes.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification:** The process name is 'Dism.exe', associated with Microsoft's Windows Deployment Services, indicating it's part of standard Windows operations.\n   \n2. **Event Type:** Each event logs a file deletion detected by the system under the rule 'FileDeleteDetected'. This alerts to files being removed.\n\n3. **File Paths Analysis:** All files are in a temporary directory under the user's profile, suggesting they are temporary or cached files meant for cleanup.\n\n4. **File Names:** The filenames are DLLs with .mui extensions and a couple without, typical of localization resource files used during setup processes.\n\n5. **Event Consistency:** All events share the same process and file path structure, consistent with Dism.exe performing cleanup operations in a temp directory.\n\n6. **Volume of Events:** Multiple deletions from the same process are reasonable for legitimate operations like cleaning up after an update or installation.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** The pattern aligns with normal Windows behavior, making it unlikely to be malicious.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events are likely legitimate as part of Windows deployment or cleanup processes involving Dism.exe deleting temporary files. Therefore, the activity is not considered malicious.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"step-by-step\": [\n    {\n      \"process\": \"Dism.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process related to Windows Deployment Services.\",\n      \"event_type\": \"File deletion events under 'FileDeleteDetected' rule\",\n      \"file_paths\": \"All files located in a temporary directory, suggesting they are temporary or cache files.\",\n      \"file_names\": \"The filenames are DLLs with .mui extensions and others without, typical of Windows resource files.\",\n      \"event_consistency\": \"Multiple events from the same process and path indicate legitimate cleanup operations.\",\n      \"volume_of_events\": \"The number of deletions is consistent with normal deployment or update processes.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"conclusion\": \"The activity is not malicious; it's part of standard Windows operations involving temporary file cleanup by Dism.exe.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at this JSON data that seems to be logs from a system, probably related to cybersecurity since there are mentions of processes and file paths.\n\nFirst, the initial log has an \"process\" field with a long string that looks like some kind of encoded data. It starts with 'process' containing a base64 string. That's interesting because sometimes attackers use encoding to hide malicious commands or scripts. I remember that base64 can be decoded to reveal actual content. Maybe I should try decoding it to see what's inside.\n\nI'll take the first process string: \"process\":\"{command_line\":\"powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}\"}. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no—the actual process string is the long base64 one. Let me focus on that.\n\nTrying to decode the first base64 string: 'process' field has \"U291bmRib3kuZGUgUGxhdG9yaXplZDojMjI0MzQ5NjkzNi0xMDAyLDEyNDM0OTk5MCBpZDoiMjI0MzQ5NjkzNi0xMDAyLDEyNDM0OTk5MCAjZG93bmxvYWRlZD0iV1ZhbGlkU2lyYXJ5In0='. When I decode this, it might reveal some information about the process or file.\n\nAfter decoding, I get something like \"Timestamp: '224349672-1000,124349990' and so on.\" It looks like a timestamp and possibly an identifier. Not sure if that's useful yet.\n\nThen there are logs where the process is mentioned as None or some command line with powershell.exe creating a new service. The command line includes creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". That path seems suspicious because it's using backslashes and has a long name, which is common in malware.\n\nAlso, the logs mention starting this service. Creating and starting a service can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware to ensure it runs on startup or at regular intervals.\n\nLooking at the file field, it's None except maybe where it could have been captured but isn't here. The winlog shows tasks like 'Process Create' and 'Provider Lifecycle', which are typical for system processes but could indicate malicious activity if they're unexpected.\n\nI'm thinking that this might be a case of malware using Windows services to maintain persistence. The use of powershell.exe is common for executing commands silently, especially in attacks. The path with \"unidade_logico\" and other terms seems non-standard, so it's possible the file is malicious or part of an attack.\n\nI should also check if there are any indicators of compromise (IOCs) here, like known bad processes, file hashes, or network activities. But from what I see, the main points are the creation and starting of a new service via PowerShell.\n\nTo sum up, it looks like there's suspicious activity involving the creation and execution of a service through PowerShell. This could be an attempt to establish persistence in the system, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks. The next steps would involve investigating this service further, checking its file hashes against known databases, and ensuring that all permissions and access rights are properly secured.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate potential malicious activity involving the creation of a new Windows service via PowerShell. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Process Logs**: Multiple entries show a process created using powershell.exe to execute commands. The command creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it.\n\n2. **Suspicious Command Line**:\n   - `New-Service` is used to create a new Windows service with the binary path pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - The use of `Start-Service` ensures the service runs immediately.\n\n3. **File Path Concerns**: The file path contains long, non-standard directory names (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`, etc.), which is atypical and often used to avoid detection by security tools.\n\n4. **Potential Malware Indicators**: The combination of using PowerShell for process creation and the use of non-standard paths suggests possible malicious activity, such as establishing persistence mechanisms (e.g., ensuring the service starts on boot).\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Investigate the file `tarefa_logico.exe` for malware indicators.\n- Check if \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service or should be removed.\n- Look into how this process was initiated and whether it's part of broader attack patterns.\n\nThis activity could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence on the system, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks. Further investigation is necessary to confirm the nature of the service and its implications for system security."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. I'm looking at a batch of system log events, all in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I see that most of the events involve PowerShell commands. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware often uses PowerShell to execute scripts or commands to hide its actions or make them appear more legitimate.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines:\n\n1. The first few events have a command line that creates a new service using `New-Service` and starts it with `Start-Service`. This is interesting because creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. Services are often used to ensure that malicious code runs on startup or after a system restart, making them harder to detect.\n\n2. Then there are multiple events where the command line uses `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`. This seems like a script that's being executed with restricted policies, which might be an attempt to prevent certain operations. However, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just a script running in a restricted environment.\n\n3. There are also events where the command is more complex. It retrieves files from `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` and tries to create a service with that binary path. This could indicate an attempt to install a new service on the system, which might be malicious if it's not authorized or known.\n\n4. Another set of events involve reading `.inf` files in the Windows directory using `Get-Item` and checking for specific patterns. This is suspicious because accessing INF files can relate to device drivers or system configurations. If the script is looking for certain signatures, it might be trying to detect or load unsigned drivers, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nI'm also noticing that many of these events are associated with either \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" in the `winlog` task. These terms relate to Windows' event tracking for service and driver operations. If multiple such events occur together, especially if they're not part of normal system startup or user activity, it could indicate an attempt to modify system services or drivers.\n\nThe repetition of similar commands across multiple events suggests that this might be part of a script that's iterating through different possibilities or trying multiple approaches. This kind of behavior is common in automated attacks where the attacker tests various methods to see if they can gain access or persistence.\n\nAdditionally, using `Write-Host` with 'Final result: 1' could indicate a check or verification step. If this is part of a larger script, it might be confirming whether certain conditions are met, which could be related to privilege escalation, file operations, or other malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of creating services, executing scripts with restricted policies, accessing specific files, and repeated attempts suggests potential malicious behavior.

This seems legitimate since it's querying system files, which could be part of a system audit or troubleshooting.\n\nThe 'ExecutionPolicy' is set to Restricted, which means it's running with elevated privileges but only allowing signed scripts, adding a layer of security.
