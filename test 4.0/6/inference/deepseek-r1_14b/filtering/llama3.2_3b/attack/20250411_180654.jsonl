Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The first few entries show tasks like Process accessed and Registry value set. That might be normal admin activity, but I should keep an eye on it because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.\n\nLooking at the third event, the process command line includes a script path: Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds suspiciousâ€”it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware for keylogging. The fact that this script is being executed from different paths across multiple events (like C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\etc.) suggests it's part of a campaign or repeated attempts.\n\nThere are several events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These might be related to how PowerShell initializes and runs scripts, but combined with the Get-Keystrokes script, it could indicate some automated or malicious activity.\n\nAnother red flag is the deletion of a file: File Delete logged for __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1. This looks like an attempt to remove evidence or disable certain script policies temporarily. Malware often deletes logs or temporary files to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also multiple Image Load events, which is normal when processes load libraries, but again, combined with the other suspicious activities, it adds up. The loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be legitimate, but in this context, it's worth noting.\n\nI see that some events have 'winlogbeat.exe' and 'svchost.exe', which are common system processes. Their activity doesn't seem immediately suspicious on their own, but it's part of the overall picture.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances running scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which suggests keylogging or monitoring; repeated attempts with different script paths; deletion of files that might be related to script policy testing; and a variety of tasks that could indicate process initialization or persistence mechanisms. These points collectively suggest potential malicious activity.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of events, especially the PowerShell activities with potentially malicious scripts and file deletions, indicates possible compromise or attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths, deletion of a file related to script policy testing, and other suspicious activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what they might indicate.\n\nThe first event shows that winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...\\winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is an agent used by the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect logs from Windows systems. It's pretty standard for it to create configuration files or update them. So this alone doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThe second event is powershell.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administration tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The filename \"entrada_padrao.txt\" translates to \"default entry\" in Portuguese, which doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's worth considering if this file was created as part of normal operations or if there's something unusual about its creation.\n\nLooking at both events together, they involve different processes creating files. One is from a known log collection tool and the other from PowerShell. Since these are two separate instances, I need to see if there's any correlation between them. If this was the only data, it's hard to say definitively without more context, but the combination might not be enough to trigger an investigation unless there's additional evidence of malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, since each event is a file creation that could be part of normal operations, and without indicators like unusual file paths, access times, or associated processes that are known to be malicious, I'm leaning towards these events being non-malicious. But I should also consider if the timing of these events together might hint at something more.\n\nIn conclusion, while both events involve file creation, they don't provide enough information on their own or together to suggest malicious activity. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for further investigation unless there's more context suggesting otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, which are legitimate processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
