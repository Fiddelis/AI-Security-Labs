I'm looking at a batch of events where multiple instances of powershell.exe are being executed. The command lines vary, but one stands out with an unusual PowerShell command that creates a new PS drive. That might be trying to access a remote system, which is a red flag.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs. These could be normal for PowerShell's operation, but I'm noting them just in case they're part of some malicious activity. The deletion of a temporary .ps1 file caught my attention too—malware often deletes its traces to avoid detection.\n\nI also see pipe creations and process accesses. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might not be suspicious on their own but could be part of a larger attack chain. Registry modifications are another point; attackers often use the registry to persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThe repeated ProcessCreate events with empty command lines seem odd. It's unusual for legitimate processes to have such commands, so it makes me think these might be attempts to hide what's really happening. Overall, the combination of these activities—remote drive creation, file deletion, pipe creation, and registry changes—points towards potential malicious behavior. \n\nI'm confident enough that this batch is interesting, but not entirely certain without more context or deeper analysis. The confidence level is around 0.8 because while some actions are concerning, others could be part of normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with potentially malicious command lines and activities such as file deletion, registry modifications, and process creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, several entries are from powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The tasks logged include File Delete and Image Load, which could indicate malicious activity. However, some of these might just be legitimate script execution, so I need to consider context.\n\nNext, there are multiple process creations for whoami.exe. While this is a standard system tool used to display user information, repeated executions might raise suspicion if there's no clear reason.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe is used with \/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off. This command turns off the Windows Firewall, which could be an indicator of malicious activity trying to disable security features.\n\nAdditionally, netsh.exe and svchost.exe are involved in registry changes. Svchost.exe is a common process for services, but multiple registry events without justification might suggest configuration changes for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows unusual activities: deleting files with powershell, disabling firewall, and multiple registry modifications. These could indicate a coordinated attack attempting to establish persistence and disrupt security measures.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes potentially malicious activities such as PowerShell deletions, disabling Windows Firewall via netsh, and multiple svchost.exe registry modifications which may indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, each line a separate event. There's a lot here—about 30 events or so. The first set of entries I see have \"svchost.exe\" as the process and mention that there were registry object additions or deletions. Svchost is a common system process, often associated with services, but it can be a red flag if it's doing something unusual like modifying the registry without being expected.\n\nLooking at these first 14 events: each one shows \"svchost.exe\" and involves the RegistryEvent task. That might indicate some kind of activity in the Windows Registry. While svchost itself is legitimate, repeated registry modifications could be a sign of malicious behavior, especially if they're happening without user interaction or are part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen, moving on to the next set of events: these involve \"powershell.exe\" with specific command lines. The commands look like they're trying to create a new PowerShell drive mapped to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". This is interesting because remote registry access can be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, such as lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe command line variations include \"& {New-PSDrive...\" in some logs and just \"& {}\" in others. The first one clearly shows an attempt to create a new drive, which might be part of establishing persistence or accessing another system. The second variation with \"& {}\" is less clear but could indicate that the PowerShell command was altered or perhaps an incomplete script.\n\nI also notice that the tasks associated with these events are either \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". Provider Lifecycle events in PowerShell relate to things like drives and data sources, while Engine Lifecycle relates more to the runtime of the shell. The combination of these events could suggest that the scripts are attempting to load modules or execute commands that interact with remote systems.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry without corresponding file changes might be suspicious, especially if they're not part of a known update or service restart. Then, the PowerShell activities show attempts to access or map drives, which could indicate an attempt to access another machine on the network, perhaps as part of a larger attack.\n\nThe frequency is also something to consider. Having multiple events within a short period might suggest automated or script-driven activity, which is more concerning than sporadic events. The use of both svchost and powershell.exe together raises the suspicion that these could be components of a malicious payload—using legitimate tools in unexpected ways.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these events are part of a single attack vector or separate incidents, but the combination makes it seem like they could be related. It's possible that an attacker is using svchost to make changes (like enabling remote registry access) and then using PowerShell for actual exploitation or movement within the network.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these events might be legitimate, especially if there are ongoing system updates or maintenance scripts running. But given the lack of file modifications in many events, it's harder to justify them as normal.\n\nIn conclusion, the batch shows multiple signs that could indicate malicious activity: svchost.exe making registry changes and PowerShell attempting remote drives. The combination suggests a possible attack vector, so I would classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show unusual activity including svchost.exe modifying the registry and PowerShell attempts to access remote drives. These could indicate malicious behavior such as lateral movement or persistence establishment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I'm given a batch of system events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each line represents a separate event. The key fields are 'process' which includes the command line, 'winlog' with task details, and 'file' which is None in all cases.\n\nLooking at the process field: every event shows PowerShell being executed with a specific script. The command line checks if a file named procdump.exe exists in a certain directory. If it does, it exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. This kind of check might be normal during system operations or part of an automated script.\n\nThe 'winlog' task varies between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are common Windows events related to how the event logging service operates. Provider tasks handle the registration of event providers, while Engine tasks relate to the core logging functionality.\n\nSince all file fields are None, there's no indication of file operations being logged here. The script is only checking for a file's presence, not performing any other actions like downloading or executing it.\n\nConsidering that multiple events repeat the same command and similar tasks, this might be part of a scheduled check by an application or script to ensure procdump.exe exists. It doesn't exhibit signs of malicious behavior such as repeated failed attempts, access to restricted files, or unusual times of activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider if such repeated checks could be indicative of something else. If the file in question is critical and multiple systems are checking it simultaneously, perhaps there's a configuration issue or load balancing being tested. But without more context like timestamps or originating processes, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe lack of file access events suggests that this is purely a check, not an attempt to modify or delete files. This reduces the risk of malicious intent since no actual data manipulation is occurring here.\n\nIn summary, while the repeated checks could be unusual depending on the system's baseline, there's insufficient evidence from the given data alone to classify this as malicious. It might just be normal operational behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show PowerShell checking for the existence of a file but do not indicate any malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
