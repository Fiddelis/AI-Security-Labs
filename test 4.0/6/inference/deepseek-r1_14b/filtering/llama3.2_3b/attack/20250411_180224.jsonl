{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting or not. \n\nLooking at the first event, I see cmd.exe running a command that creates a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line includes powershell.exe with -ep bypass, which is a common technique to run PowerShell in bypass mode to avoid detection. However, the script paths mentioned (c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1) don't exist according to the logs, which might mean it's trying to execute a non-existing script or perhaps those files were deleted after execution.\n\nThe second event is schtasks.exe creating another scheduled task with similar parameters. This repetition suggests an attempt to set up persistence mechanisms, possibly part of a larger attack campaign.\n\nThere are multiple instances where schtasks.exe is used both for creating and querying tasks. This activity could be legitimate admin work, but the combination with PowerShell in bypass mode raises suspicions.\n\nI notice several registry value sets from chrome.exe, which might indicate that Chrome extensions or legitimate scripts are modifying the registry. However, since this isn't unusual on its own, I'll keep it in mind but focus more on the schtasks and PowerShell activities.\n\nTwo events show winlogbeat.exe creating files, likely related to log shipping or monitoring tools. Similarly, powershell.exe is creating files named .txt, which might be innocuous if those are data files, but could also serve other purposes.\n\nThe last event shows whoami.exe being executed without any command line arguments. This is a common tool for users to check permissions, so it's not inherently suspicious unless used in conjunction with other malicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of schtasks.exe with PowerShell in bypass mode and attempts to create scheduled tasks are red flags. These behaviors are often indicative of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement in an attack. The non-existing script paths might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace or using temporary files. While some events could be benign, the combination points towards potential malicious activity that deserves investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of schtasks.exe creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell in bypass mode and non-existing script paths suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
