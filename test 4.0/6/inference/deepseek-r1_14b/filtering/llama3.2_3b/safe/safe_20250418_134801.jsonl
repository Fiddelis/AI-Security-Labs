Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are about Microsoft Edge updates. They mention file creations and changes in creation times for setup.exe files. That seems normal since Edge is updating, so it's creating temporary files as part of the update process.\n\nThen there's an event where CompatTelRunner.exe loads amsi.dll. I know that CompatTelRunner is related to Windows compatibility features, and loading amsi (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) is standard for checking scripts, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, several events are about \"Special Logon\" and \"User Account Management.\" These are typical system logon events, maybe from services or user logins. They don't indicate any immediate issues.\n\nI see a PowerShell command being executed with the command line: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted... It's using Get-Item to look for *.inf files in C:\\Windows\\inf and checking if they contain specific strings related to install sections. This could be part of some system check or update process, but since it's restricted execution policy, maybe it's a legitimate script running with limited privileges.\n\nThen there are events about taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is normal as task scheduler-related processes do that.\n\nsvchost.exe is spawning with different parameters for services like BthAvctpSvc. That's expected behavior; svchost hosts various system services.\n\nAnother CompatTelRunner event loads taskschd.dll again, which seems fine.\n\nLooking further, there are file creations by svchost.exe in the DeliveryOptimization directories. These are part of Windows updates or feature delivery, so they're standard activities.\n\nEdgeUpdate.exe is creating files related to the Edge update process. This is normal for software updates.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related DLLs is expected as it's part of Windows Defender operations.\n\nThere's a file deletion event by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a temp file in the user's Temp directory, which is standard during installations or updates when temporary files are no longer needed.\n\nThe last event is MpCmdRun creating a lock file in the Temp directory, likely to manage processes during scans, which is normal.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are related to legitimate system operations like updates, service executions, and antivirus activities. No signs of unusual behavior or malicious actions. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creations, file operations, and user account management, which are typical in a running operating system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about MpCmdRun.exe being loaded. That sounds familiar; I think that's related to Windows Defender. So it's probably a legitimate process, nothing malicious there. The second event has null values for process, winlog task, and file, which doesn't provide any useful info but also isn't suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple events involving git.exe creating files in the node_modules folder. That looks like someone is working with Node.js packages, maybe installing or updating modules. Git being used here makes sense if it's part of a development workflow. The paths seem normal for a project directory on a user's machine.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual processes, file deletions, network connections, or other red flags.

They're all within the node_modules folder of a directory named after a course: \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This makes me think this is related to a development environment, probably setting up or updating some Node.js modules.\n\nLooking at the files being created, I see various JavaScript files and package.json. These are typical when installing or updating dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Git.exe might be part of a DevOps setup where scripts run as part of version control processes, like during CI\/CD pipelines. The file paths also suggest that this is happening on a Windows system, given the backslashes in the paths.\n\nI don't see any unusual or suspicious activity here. All events are about creating files related to Node.js packages, which is standard when dependencies are being installed. There's no indication of access to sensitive files, attempts to execute binaries outside the expected scope, or any signs of data exfiltration.

This suggests it's part of a standard npm install operation or similar Git-based activity during development. Node_modules is a common directory in JavaScript\/Node.js projects where dependencies are stored.\n\nThe file paths include standard project files like package.json, README.md, license files, and configuration files like .eslintrc.

The user has given me a JSONL of events and wants me to analyze the entire batch to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all share the same process name: \"git.exe\". The task is labeled as \"File created\" with the rule FileCreate. The files being created are within the node_modules directory of a user's Downloads folder. The specific paths include modules like side-channel, signal-exit, slice-ansi, and sshpk, along with their associated files like package.json, README.md, etc.\n\nI need to consider if this batch is relevant for investigation. Since all events are from git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, it seems related to software development or module installations. Node.js modules are commonly downloaded during development, so these activities are typical when someone is setting up or working on a project that uses npm.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior here? The actions don't show anything unusual like access to restricted areas, multiple failed attempts, or changes to system files. They're all standard file creations in a known software development context.\n\nConsidering confidence level: 0.8. It's high because the activities are clearly related to legitimate software setup, but there's always a tiny chance that malicious actors might mimic such behavior, though it's unlikely here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during software development or module installations and does not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

I'm looking at each event one by one. They all have the same process name: git.exe. The task in each case is a file creation event. The files being created are located under a path that includes \"node_modules\", which makes me think this is related to a Node.js project setup.\n\nSo, what's happening here? It seems like Git is cloning or updating a repository and creating various files within the node_modules directory. This is pretty standard when you're setting up dependencies for a Node.js application. Each file created could be part of different npm packages, like sshpk and string-width, which are common in such projects.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process is straightforwardâ€”Git is handling the creation of these files as part of the project setup. There's no unusual file paths or activities that would raise a red flag. All events look legitimate and expected during development work.\n\nTherefore, I don't think this batch needs further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by understanding what each event represents.\n\nEach line is a JSON object with three main keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which tells me it's related to Git operations. The winlog task mentions \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate,\" indicating that a file was created on the system. The file paths all lead into specific locations within a directory structure, like \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\\" followed by different package names such as strip-final-newline, strip-json-comments, supports-color, and tcomb-validation.\n\nI notice that each event has a similar structure: they're all generated by git.exe creating files in the node_modules folder. Node_modules is typically where npm packages are stored, which makes me think this is part of a software development project, likely using JavaScript or TypeScript since npm is involved.\n\nLooking at the paths, these seem to be standard files that come with npm packagesâ€”things like package.json, index.js, readme.md, etc. The fact that multiple such events are happening in sequence suggests that the system is installing or updating dependencies for a project, possibly during a build process or when someone is setting up their development environment.\n\nI'm also noting the consistency in the event structure and the specific files being created. There's no indication of any unusual activity like access to sensitive directories, execution of unknown scripts, or creation of hidden files. The file paths are all within user downloads and project-specific folders, which aligns with normal development workflows.\n\nConsidering that git.exe is involved, it might be part of a CI\/CD pipeline or someone manually cloning repositories and managing dependencies. Since these events don't show any signs of deviation from expected behaviorâ€”like unexpected file creation times, access to restricted areas, or writes to unusual locationsâ€”it doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nI should also think about the frequency of such events. While I can't see the timing here, if this were happening over a short period and in high volumes without context, it might be suspicious. However, given that each event is just creating standard files for npm packages, it's more likely normal unless there are other indicators.\n\nAnother point to consider is the user context. The path starts with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\\", which suggests this is a user directory. If fiddelis is an active developer or part of the organization's development team, these activities would be expected. There's no evidence of elevated privileges or execution under different credentials, which could hint at malicious activity.\n\nI also check if any of the file paths point to scripts or executables that might execute upon creation. The files being created are package.json, readme.md, etc., which are standard and not typically executable. There's nothing like .bat files or .exe being written here, so no immediate risk indicators from the file types.\n\nFurthermore, considering the entire batch as a whole, these events seem to be part of a larger process of setting up project dependencies. It's possible that someone is initializing a new npm project within a Git repository, which would involve both cloning repositories with git.exe and installing packages via npm, leading to the creation of these files.\n\nIn summary, each event individually doesn't indicate malicious behavior, but looking at them as a whole also doesn't suggest any red flags. They're consistent with normal development activities, specifically around managing Node.js packages. Without additional context or anomalies in the data, there's no compelling reason to classify this batch as interesting for investigation.\n\nSo, after analyzing all these points, I conclude that the batch is NOT INTERESTING because it aligns with typical user activity in a development environment and doesn't exhibit any signs of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard file creation activities related to npm package installations, indicative of normal development workflows.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at these JSONL events where each line represents an event. The first thing I notice is that all the events are from the same process: git.exe. That makes sense because Git operations often involve file system interactions.\n\nEach event has a similar structure: it's a file creation event (File created) triggered by the Git process. The files being created are all under the node_modules\/tcomb\/lib directory, and each one is a different JavaScript fileâ€”like Date.js, RegExp.js, String.js, etc. This seems like standard behavior when modules are being installed or built during a Git operation, perhaps during a clone, fetch, or build process.\n\nI'm thinking about whether multiple file creation events in the same directory from Git could be indicative of malicious activity. Usually, if someone is doing something nefarious, they might try to hide their tracks or create files in less expected places. But node_modules is a common directory for JavaScript packages and modules, so it's more likely that this is part of normal software development activities.\n\nAlso, considering the paths provided, everything points to legitimate parts of a project's structure. There's no indication of unusual file names or locations outside the expected module directories. The files being created are all library files, which is typical when setting up or updating dependencies in a Node.js project.\n\nI should also consider if there's any anomaly in the number of events. Ten or more file creations in a row could be normal during an install or build process. If it were a single event or something out of place, that would raise more flags. But here, each file is part of the same module and follows a predictable naming pattern.\n\nAnother angle to think about is whether Git.exe itself is commonly used for malicious purposes. While any tool can be misused, Git's primary use is version control, so seeing it create files in its expected directories doesn't trigger red flags for me.\n\nIn summary, these logs don't show anything unusual or out of place. They align with normal development activities involving Git and Node.js modules. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, suspicious file operations, or other indicators that would suggest malicious behavior. Therefore, I'd classify this batch as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal file creation activities during a Git process, likely part of module installation or development.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
