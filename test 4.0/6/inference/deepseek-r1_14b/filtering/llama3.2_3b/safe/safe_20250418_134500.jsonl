{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a closer look at these logs. It seems like there are several entries related to the Microsoft Edge update process. The first log shows a Process Create event for \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" and includes some detailed information about the product version and build numbers.\n\nI'm noticing that each entry has three main parts: process, winlog, and file. This structure is pretty consistent across all logs, which probably makes it easier to parse. The presence of GUIDs in the file paths suggests that these are unique identifiers for specific update packages or components.\n\nThe second log includes a lot more details, like the product name \"MicrosoftEdge\" and the specific build numbers 135.0.3179.73 and 135.0.3179.66. This makes me think that Edge is going through an update process, possibly downloading and extracting new components.\n\nLooking at the third log, it seems like another file creation event for \"setup.exe\" inside a temporary directory named EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp. Temporary files are common during installations or updates because they're used to extract necessary files before they're copied to their final destination.\n\nI'm also seeing references to different GUIDs in the paths, such as {56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062} and {5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}. These are likely used by Microsoft to uniquely identify each update package, ensuring that updates are applied correctly without conflicts.\n\nThe build numbers seem to follow a pattern: 135.0.3179.73 and 135.0.3179.66. The first part is probably the major version, followed by minor versions or release channels, then the specific build number. These numbers help in tracking updates and ensuring compatibility.\n\nIn summary, these logs detail a Microsoft Edge update process where several files are being created as part of the download and installation steps. Each step seems to be logged with relevant GUIDs for tracking purposes, and the file paths indicate temporary directories used during the update.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs you provided appear to be related to the Microsoft Edge update process. Here's a breakdown of what each log might represent:\n\n1. **First Log Entry:**\n   - **Process:** `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is created with specific version information (`FileVersion: 135.0.3179.73`, `ProductVersion: 135.0.3179.66`). This likely indicates that the Edge update process has started.\n   - **WinLog:** The event type is \"Process Create,\" which is a standard Windows log entry when a new process is created.\n\n2. **Second Log Entry:**\n   - **Process:** `MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` is created. This suggests that Edge itself is being updated, as the process name includes \"X64\" (indicating a 64-bit version) and specific build numbers.\n   - **WinLog:** Again, this is a \"Process Create\" event.\n\n3. **Third Log Entry:**\n   - **File Created:** A file named `setup.exe` is created in the path `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp`. This likely indicates that Edge is being installed or updated, as `setup.exe` is a common installer filename.\n\n### Summary:\nThese logs show the creation of processes and files related to Microsoft Edge updates. The presence of GUIDs (e.g., `{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}`) suggests that these are unique identifiers for specific update packages or components.\n\nIf you're concerned about these logs, it's likely normal activity from Edge updating itself. However, if you notice unusual behavior or unexpected files, you might want to investigate further or run a antivirus scan to ensure there is no malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of three JSONL events to analyze for potential malicious behavior. Let me look through each event and see if anything stands out.\n\nFirst event: It's from the process MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe, which is related to Microsoft Edge. The task is a file creation time change rule (FileCreateTime). The file path is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{GUID}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\setup.exe. That seems normal because Edge updates often create temporary files and might adjust their timestamps.\n\nSecond event: Process is null, which probably means it's a system-level activity. The task is File created (rule: FileCreate) for C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl. That looks like standard Windows update logging, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThird event: Process name is winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as part of the Elastic WinLogBeat tool used for log shipping. The task is File created (rule: FileCreate), and the file path is within a user's Downloads directory with a .yml.new extension. This seems like a configuration file being written by WinLogBeat during its setup or update.\n\nPutting it all together, all events are related to legitimate system activitiesâ€”browsing, Windows updates, and log management tools. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual process behavior, or signs of malware.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities including Edge update, Windows logging, and WinLogBeat configuration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
