{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user provided a series of JSONL events and wants me to determine if they're interesting or not based on cybersecurity expertise.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. Chrome doing a DNS query is normal.\n2. whoami.exe running without any flags seems routine for process creation.\n3. Powershell being accessed multiple times could be a red flag, but sometimes it's just legitimate use.\n4. Winlogbeat creating files is expected if it's part of the logging setup.\n5. Another powershell access and registry change—this might indicate something suspicious, as scripts often manipulate the registry.\n6. cmd.exe with certutil commands to encode\/decode calc.exe sounds malicious because calc is a common file used in exploits. Using certutil for encoding suggests trying to hide payload.\n7. More powershell accesses and cmd.exe registry writes reinforce that there's potentially malicious activity.\n8. Certutil being used multiple times with different command lines—this seems like part of an attack, possibly creating files or executing them.\n9. File creation and executable detection by certutil could be setting up a malicious file on the system.\n10. Processes like rundll32.exe and SDXHelper.exe loading DLLs might not be suspicious alone, but in combination with other events, they could indicate something's off.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of powershell, cmd.exe, and certutil being used to manipulate files and registry entries suggest potential malicious activity. The use of certutil to encode\/decode calc.exe is a strong indicator of an attack, as this is a known technique for creating malicious payloads. Therefore, the batch shows signs of suspicious behavior that should be investigated.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe with potentially malicious command lines, including use of certutil.exe to encode\/decode files, indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connection detections. Chrome is a common browser, so it makes sense it would make network connections. But having several in a row might be worth noting, but I'm not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen, there's an event where powershell.exe created a file called componente_auxiliar.txt in the user's Downloads folder. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. Creating files directly in user directories could be normal or it might be part of malicious activity.\n\nNext, I see several events where chrome.exe is setting registry values. Again, Chrome does modify the registry for settings and extensions, so this might not be unusual unless these entries are unexpected or repeated excessively.\n\nThere's an event from SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a known system file, so that seems normal.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so this looks legitimate.\n\nBack to powershell.exe events: there are two where it sets registry values and two more where it accesses processes. Accessing processes could be part of script execution or legitimate admin tasks, but it's another point that might raise an eyebrow if combined with other actions.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple Chrome network connections and registry modifications, along with PowerShell creating a file in Downloads, accessing processes, and setting registry values—these could indicate possible malicious activity. However, without more context, like timestamps or additional events showing actual suspicious behavior (like downloading malware), it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because there are multiple potentially concerning actions from different processes, especially the combination involving PowerShell which is often targeted by attackers.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show unusual activity including repeated network connections and registry modifications by chrome.exe, file creation in Downloads by powershell.exe, and process access. These could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
