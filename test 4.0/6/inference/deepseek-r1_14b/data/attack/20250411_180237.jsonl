{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180237.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. There are instances where powershell sets registry values (RegistryEvent), which could be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see that some commands might be trying to list processes using tasklist.exe and whoami.exe. These tools can be used by attackers to gather information about the system. However, they're also common for regular system monitoring, so it's not immediately clear if they're malicious.\n\nThere are entries where files are being created or accessed, like entrada_logico.txt. Creating new files could be part of dropping malware or establishing persistence. The path seems arbitrary, which might be suspicious.\n\nI notice that winlogbeat.exe is involved in creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is legitimate for log management, but the creation of this specific file could indicate configuration changes, possibly by malicious actors to tamper with logs.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe also sets registry values. This process is usually part of Windows' background services, so unexpected registry activity might be a red flag.\n\nOverall, while some actions are normal, others like multiple powershell executions and suspicious file creations could indicate potential malicious behavior. The combination suggests possible recon, persistence setup, or lateral movement, making the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe performing registry modifications and creating files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
