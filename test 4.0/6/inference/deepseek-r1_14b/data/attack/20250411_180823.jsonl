{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial entries, there are multiple instances where `chrome.exe` is making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome usually handles a lot of network traffic for browsing. No red flags here yet.\n\nNext, I see events from processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. The tasks mentioned—like registry value sets or process accesses—are standard operations. Not too concerning on their own.\n\nThen, there's an entry with `calc.exe` loading a specific DLL file (`urlmon.dll`). I'm aware that legitimate processes can load various DLLs, but sometimes malicious actors might abuse familiar tools like calc.exe for payload execution. This could be a potential indicator, but it's not definitive yet.\n\nMoving further down, I notice multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`. The command line arguments in these events catch my attention. For example:\n- `cmd.exe \/c schtasks \/create \/tn \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" \/sc onlogon \/tr \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\"`\nThis looks like a scheduled task being created that runs calc.exe at logon. Similarly, other tasks are set to run calc.exe on startup or under specific user contexts.\n\nThe repeated use of schtasks.exe with command lines creating tasks that execute calc.exe is suspicious. Typically, legitimate usage of schtasks wouldn't involve such repetitive creation, especially with the same payload (calc.exe). This pattern suggests possible persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access and execute malicious code at system startup or user logon.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple RegistryEvent entries from various processes like svchost.exe. While svchost is a common Windows process for services, frequent registry writes could indicate installation of malicious software components, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or for creating backdoors.\n\nConsidering the overall batch, the combination of multiple scheduled tasks pointing to calc.exe execution and unusual file creation events (like `File created` under specific paths) adds up. These behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activities aimed at establishing persistence and ensuring code execution on compromised systems.\n\nWhile not all events individually are alarming, their collective nature raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or malware activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious process creations and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity. Notable patterns include repeated use of schtasks.exe to create new tasks executing calc.exe, which could indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by understanding each event.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from different processes like svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and others. The tasks being logged vary but mostly involve registry value sets and some file operations.\n\nI notice that svchost.exe is involved in multiple events where it's setting registry values. That's a bit concerning because svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but it's commonly used by malware to hide their activities. So repeated registry modifications could be suspicious.\n\nThen there are entries from cmd.exe and conhost.exe also setting registry values. Those are typically command-line tools, so if they're making changes to the registry without clear justification, that might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe, I see it's involved in both setting registry values and creating files. PowerShell is powerful but often misused by attackers for scripting tasks, including downloading and executing malicious code. The file created here is named unidade_ativo.txt, which doesn't immediately raise a red flag, but the combination of creating files and modifying registries with powershell.exe might be concerning.\n\nThere's also an entry from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe setting registry values. Those are standard system processes, so it's unusual for them to modify the registry in this context.\n\nAnother point is the file path involving \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\". The name seems suspicious, possibly related to Portuguese terms like 'pacote' meaning package or update. This could indicate a malicious script or process creating scheduled tasks which might be harmful.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so unless it's running with elevated privileges or interacting with unexpected files, this might not be too alarming on its own.\n\nLastly, chrome.exe has several registry set events and loaded images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While those are legitimate system files, the repeated registry access could suggest some form of persistence mechanism being set up, which is common in malware.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple processes are performing suspicious tasks: modifying registries, creating files, especially with names that seem off or related to known malicious activities. The use of tools like powershell.exe and svchost.exe adds to the suspicion. It's possible that this batch shows signs of a potential attack where different parts of the system are being compromised or configured maliciously.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if each event is definitively malicious, but collectively, they create a concerning pattern. The volume of registry modifications across various legitimate-looking processes stands out as unusual behavior that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, file creation in user's downloads folder, and potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are seven events where the process is chrome.exe and the task is a Registry value set. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings, so these might be normal user activity. Nothing too suspicious here unless the same event repeats an unusual number of times, but seven seems within expected bounds for a browser's operation.\n\nNext, there are two events from powershell.exe. The first one under ProcessAccess could be legitimate since PowerShell is commonly used for scripting and system administration. However, malicious actors might also abuse it, so I need to consider the context here. But looking at these logs alone, without more details on what PowerShell is doing, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThen there's an event from whoami.exe being executed. This command is typically used to display user information, which can be part of legitimate system administration tasks or reconnaissance by attackers to gather info about the current user. The presence of whoami might raise an eyebrow, but again, without more context on how it was triggered or what followed, it's hard to assess its intent.\n\nI also notice that none of these events have a file associated with them (file: None). So there's no indication of files being accessed or modified in these logs. That makes me think they're process-related actions rather than file operations, which could be more telling.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows some activity from legitimate processes like Chrome and PowerShell, along with a single whoami.exe execution. While whoami can be part of malicious activities, without additional context or unusual patterns (like multiple failed attempts, odd timestamps, etc.), I'm leaning towards this not being indicative of a breach but rather normal or possibly exploratory user actions.\n\nTherefore, my classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because while some events could be red flags, the lack of further details and repetition makes me uncertain. But if there were more indicators like unusual files accessed or repeated failed attempts, I'd reconsider.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal user activity such as Chrome registry interactions and legitimate PowerShell usage. The single whoami.exe execution might be exploratory but lacks additional indicators of malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
