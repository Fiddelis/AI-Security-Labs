{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That doesn't immediately seem suspicious because Chrome does a lot of network activity as part of its normal operation. I don't think those alone would raise flags unless they were unusual in some way, but nothing here stands out yet.\n\nThen, there are several events from powershell.exe. The first thing that catches my eye is the command lines. For example, one event shows a command line starting with powershell.exe followed by a call to Start-Process, which runs another batch file located at \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". This is interesting because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. The use of multiple backslashes and the \"..\\\" suggests that the path might be trying to navigate up directories, which could indicate an attempt to access files outside intended locations.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes, sets registry values, loads images like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET Framework. While these can be part of normal operations, loading multiple system DLLs might be a sign that something is being injected or running malicious code. Also, the fact that there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a script (ps1 file) in the Temp directory could indicate that an attacker is trying to execute a script temporarily to avoid detection.\n\nThe command lines in some events are obfuscated with multiple backslashes and paths leading to .bat files. This makes me think it's attempting to run scripts from unusual locations, possibly outside the standard directories, which could be a tactic to hide malicious activity or bypass certain security measures.\n\nAdditionally, there are Provider Lifecycle tasks, which might indicate that something is trying to load or unload drivers or other components, potentially for persistence mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple network connections from Chrome (but not alarming on their own), and PowerShell activities including script execution via batch files, registry modifications, loading system DLLs, creating temporary files, and deleting them quickly—all of these are red flags. These behaviors could be indicative of malicious activity such as script injection, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of using PowerShell with obfuscated command lines, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and multiple system DLL loads points towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events show potential script execution attempts, including creating and deleting a temporary .ps1 file. Obfuscated command lines and registry modifications are suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being executed with command lines that start other .bat scripts. The paths in these commands are a bit long and seem to navigate up directories using \"..\", which could indicate they're trying to access files outside their current directory. This might be suspicious because attackers often use such techniques to hide file locations.\n\nNext, there are several entries where the task is \"Registry value set\". Registry modifications can be normal for applications, but when combined with other activities like PowerShell executions, it raises a red flag. Malware often uses registry keys to maintain persistence or execute malicious scripts on startup.\n\nI also see that some events involve files being accessed or loaded. For example, one event shows that powershell.exe is loading MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While these are legitimate Windows files, the way they're accessed alongside other suspicious activities could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nThere's an instance where cmd.exe is used to execute a .bat script. This is concerning because command-line scripts can be used to run arbitrary commands, including those that might execute malicious code. The path in this case points to \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat\", which again seems like an unusually long and potentially malicious file location.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where the same .exe files (like chrome.exe and conhost.exe) are modifying registry values. While these applications can perform such actions during normal operation, the frequency and combination with other activities might suggest they're being misused.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to execute scripts from various directories, coupled with frequent registry modifications and file accesses, indicates potential malicious behavior. This batch shows a pattern that's often associated with attacks or unauthorized access attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity, including executing scripts from various directories and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by analyzing each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several instances where different processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and svchost.exe are performing tasks such as setting registry values. These activities alone might seem normal since these processes can have legitimate uses, but I should consider the frequency and context.\n\nThen, a lot of events come from chrome.exe, specifically multiple Registry value set tasks. Chrome is known to interact with the registry for settings and extensions, so this could be part of its normal operation. However, the number of such events (eight in total) might raise an eyebrow—could there be malicious activity using Chrome?\n\nLooking at other entries, like powershell.exe creating files, I know that PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. The creation of .txt files in user directories might not be suspicious on its own, but it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory—svchost is typically for system services, so this could be normal unless there's something unusual about the file path or content.\n\nAnother point is winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That seems straightforward if winlogbeat is running as intended to collect logs.\n\nConsidering all events together, I don't see clear indicators of malicious activity like multiple failed logins, unexpected network connections, or known malicious process behaviors. Most activities are within the realm of normal operations for legitimate processes.\n\nThe high number of registry writes by Chrome stands out, but without additional context suggesting suspicious behavior (like persistence mechanisms beyond usual settings), it's hard to classify this as malicious. The other events don't add up to a pattern that clearly points to an attack.\n\nSo, after reviewing each event and considering their collective context, I'm leaning towards the batch being not particularly interesting for investigation. However, there's some uncertainty because unusual frequencies could hint at potential issues.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe and other processes may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
