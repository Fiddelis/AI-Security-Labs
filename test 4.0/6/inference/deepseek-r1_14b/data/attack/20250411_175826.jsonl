{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That's normal since Chrome does a lot of networking. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, powershell.exe appears several times with different tasks. It started a process, accessed other processes, modified registry values, and loaded various DLLs. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. The command line in one event looks like it's trying to set file modification times, which might be an attempt to hide activity or tamper with logs.\n\nThere are also events where files were created and then deleted by powershell.exe. Creating temporary files and immediately deleting them is a common tactic for malicious scripts to avoid detection. The specific path mentioned (__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1) sounds like it's part of some script testing, which might be related to persistence or evasion techniques.\n\nOther processes like whoami.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are also present but don't seem out of the ordinary unless they're being used in an unusual way. Notepad modifying registry values is another pointâ€”though not impossible, it's less common and could indicate unauthorized changes.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with suspicious activities like file creation\/deletion and registry modifications stands out. These behaviors are often indicative of malicious scripts trying to hide their tracks or establish persistence. The combination suggests possible command and control activity or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nI'm confident enough that this batch shows signs of potential malicious behavior, so I'll classify it as interesting with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe showing suspicious activities such as process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and network connections. These behaviors could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell.exe accessing something with a task named \"Process accessed.\" Not too alarming yet. Then there's a series of events where PowerShell is modifying file timestamps using command lines that look like they're setting LastWriteTime to an old date, January 1, 1970. This seems suspicious because altering file times can be part of hiding or obfuscating activities.\n\nLooking further, multiple entries show similar command-line patterns targeting different files across various directories. This repetition suggests a script might be running, possibly trying to change multiple file timestamps in a patterned way. Such behavior could be an attempt to cover tracks by making files look older than they are.\n\nThen there's an event where svchost.exe sets registry values twice. SvcHost is often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might indicate malicious configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\nOther events include Calculator.exe and conhost.exe also accessing or modifying files, which could be part of a broader campaign. The event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads folder seems unrelated unless it's part of data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell instances with potentially malicious scripts altering file times across various directories, along with svchost.exe making registry changes. These activities could be signs of a cyberattack aiming to hide evidence or establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file timestamps in an unusual pattern, potentially indicating attempts to obscure activity. Additionally, svchost.exe and conhost.exe registry modifications may suggest malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes. ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both show registry value sets. That's a bit unusual because those apps typically don't make many changes to the system's registry unless something is wrong or malicious. Then, I see powershell.exe with two different tasks: one for setting a registry value and another for process access. PowerShell can be used for legitimate admin tasks, but it's also commonly abused by attackers for command execution.\n\nLooking further down, there are several entries from chrome.exe. Most of these involve registry changes and some pipe creation. While Chrome might need to create pipes for inter-process communication, the sheer number of registry writes could be suspicious. Registry events alone aren't always bad, but in large volumes, especially when combined with other activities like process access or file creations, they can indicate something malicious.\n\nThere's also a file created event from winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of their data collection process. Not too concerning on its own. Then, another file creation by powershell.exe for a file named 'unidade_logico.txt'. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but creating files can be part of malicious activities like storing payload or stolen data.\n\nOne event from chrome.exe shows an image load into AMSI.DLL and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender components, so that seems normal. But in the context of other suspicious activity, it could be worth noting.\n\nThe majority of events are registry writes by chrome.exe. This is a red flag because web browsers don't usually make many changes to the system's registry during normal operation. If Chrome is making numerous registry modifications, especially without user interaction, it might indicate a compromised process or malicious extension.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm noticing several points of interest:\n1. Multiple processes (powershell.exe, chrome.exe) modifying the registry.\n2. Powershell.exe accessing processes and creating files.\n3. A high volume of registry writes by Chrome, which is unusual.\n\nThese activities could indicate a potential compromise or malicious behavior. The combination suggests possible persistence mechanisms, file creation for data storage, and process manipulation. While each event might not be overtly suspicious on its own, the collective actions across different processes raise concerns about potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe and PowerShell activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
