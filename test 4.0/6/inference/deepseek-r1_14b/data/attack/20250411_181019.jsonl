{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs from a system. Each event has process info, winlog data, and sometimes file details.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful for scripting and can execute commands. The events show things like 'Process accessed' and even a 'Registry value set', which could be signs of malicious activity since attackers might try to hide their actions in the registry.\n\nThen there are entries with 'cmd.exe' and command lines that create services, like sc.exe. Commands like creating a service with a binPath pointing to a script (even if it's NonExistingScript.ps1) might indicate someone trying to set up persistence or execute malicious scripts on startup. The use of 'sc create' and 'sc qc' suggests they're configuring services, which could be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the Registry value sets across various processes—services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe—it seems like there's a lot of activity in the Windows registry. Malware often modifies the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations, so this could be suspicious.\n\nThere are also entries where normal user tools like notepad.exe and calc.exe are accessing the registry, which is unusual because regular users don't typically do that. For example, 'calc.exe' loading urlmon.dll might not be a big deal on its own, but combined with other events, it could raise flags.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events—many similar processes creating services or modifying the registry—is concerning. It doesn't look like normal system behavior. Typically, you wouldn't see so many service creations and registry modifications in a short period unless something is trying to set up multiple persistence points or execute malicious scripts.\n\nI also notice that some command lines are obfuscated with escaped characters (like \\\/c), which is a common tactic to bypass detection by antivirus software. This makes me think that these commands were crafted to avoid being easily recognized as malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell access, service creation via cmd and sc.exe, registry modifications across multiple processes, and obfuscated command lines suggests possible malicious activity. These are red flags often seen in cyberattacks where attackers try to establish persistence and hide their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe access, service creation with suspicious commands, and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's likely part of the logging setup or configuration. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, there are several events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and multiple instances of powershell.exe all setting registry values. Registry writes can be part of legitimate software operations, like configuring settings during runtime. However, I should keep an eye out because malicious actors might use the registry for persistence or other activities.\n\nThen, I notice a lot of events from chrome.exe accessing registry keys and loading system32 files. Chrome often does this when running extensions or plugins, so those could be normal operations unless something unusual is happening with how it accesses them.\n\nLooking closer, there's an event where powershell.exe accesses another process, which could be suspicious because PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. But without more context on what exactly was accessed, it's hard to say if this is harmful.\n\nI'm also checking the file paths mentioned, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are known legitimate system files used by Windows Defender. The fact that chrome.exe loaded them doesn't raise immediate red flags.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they don't point to any clear signs of malicious behavior. They mostly involve common processes performing typical actions like writing to the registry or loading system libraries. While some activities could be concerning on their own, in this batch, there's no evidence of unusual patterns or multiple indicators that would suggest an attack.\n\nHowever, the repeated RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe and powershell.exe might warrant closer monitoring over time. But for a single batch analysis, I wouldn't classify it as definitely suspicious yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing legitimate operations such as file creation, registry modifications, and loading standard system files. No signs of malicious behavior are present in this batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
