Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is the execution of whoami.exe. That's a common utility used to find out user information. It doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's worth noting since it can be part of privilege escalation or info-gathering in attacks.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities. I see several instances where powershell.exe is accessing the registry (Registry value set), which could be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\nLooking closer at one event, the command line shows a script that's using findstr to search for the word \"pass\" in various file extensions like .xml, .doc, etc. This seems suspicious because it looks like it's searching for sensitive information or credentials. The use of select-string with an error action silenced might be trying to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1). Creating and then deleting files can be part of removing traces, which is typical in malicious activities. This could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or delete evidence after execution.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line for powershell.exe. Repeated process creations with the same script might suggest a loop or repeated attempts to execute code, possibly to ensure persistence or avoid detection.\n\nThe files being loaded by PowerShell include various .NET and Microsoft DLLs, which is normal, but combined with other activities, it raises suspicion about what the script is doing.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows powershell.exe executing scripts that search for sensitive information, creating and deleting temporary files, and multiple process creations. These are red flags because they can be signs of data exfiltration, credential harvesting, or persistence mechanisms commonly used in attacks. The combination of these activities makes the batch highly indicative of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts searching for sensitive data, combined with file creation and deletion activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. My goal is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The command line includes 'findstr' looking for \"pass\" in various file types like *.xml, *.doc, etc., followed by a select-string command searching for \"password\". That seems suspicious because PowerShell scripts are often used for malicious activities, especially when combined with commands that search for sensitive information.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is legitimate, but the creation of a new .yml file might be worth noting if it's unexpected or part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there are entries related to processes like notepad.exe setting registry values and svchost.exe doing similar actions. Registry modifications can indicate malicious activity, but they're also common in legitimate software installations. Without more context, it's hard to say, but multiple such events could be concerning.\n\nI see several ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll, which is a known Windows system file, so that doesn't raise red flags on its own. However, when combined with other suspicious activities, it might contribute to the concern.\n\nThere are multiple RegistryEvent tasks across different processes like svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, and others. Again, while registry changes can be normal, frequent or unusual ones might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the process names, I also spot conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe making registry changes. These are typically legitimate system processes, but their involvement in multiple events could warrant closer inspection.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that several of these events involve powershell.exe accessing different files and registry entries. The repetition of similar commands across multiple logs might suggest a script running multiple times or part of a larger campaign.\n\nTaking all this into account, while some individual events aren't necessarily malicious on their own, the combination—especially the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands that search for sensitive data and the multiple system process accessing files and registry entries—raises concern. This pattern could indicate potential unauthorized access, data exfiltration attempts, or other malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell processes with commands searching for sensitive information and system processes modifying registry values, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a task to analyze a batch of system log events and determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each individual event to understand what's happening. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first few events all have 'chrome.exe' as the process name and involve registry value sets. There are a lot of these—six in total before moving on. That seems normal because Chrome interacts with the Windows registry for various settings, so frequent writes might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file. Winlogbeat is likely a log collection tool, so it creating configuration files makes sense and shouldn't raise any flags.\n\nNext, there are two events related to loading images in Chrome: one for 'amsi.dll' and another for 'MpOAV.dll'. These are legitimate system files used by Windows Defender and other security features. Loading these is normal and not concerning.\n\nAfter that, I see several more registry writes from Chrome—nothing unusual so far.\n\nThere's an event where 'powershell.exe' creates a file named 'objeto_logico.txt' in the Downloads folder. This catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Creating a file could be part of script execution, which might be suspicious depending on other indicators.\n\nFinally, there are more network connection events from Chrome—this is expected as Chrome handles multiple connections for browsing.\n\nThe last event has no process name but logs a DNS query. That's a bit odd because it's unusual to have an event without the process context, but DNS queries themselves are common and not necessarily malicious unless they point to known bad domains.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch contains mostly normal activities from Chrome, such as registry writes and network connections, along with legitimate operations by winlogbeat and loading of system files. However, the creation of a file by PowerShell could be a red flag since it's a common tool for attackers. Additionally, the last event without a process is unusual but not conclusive on its own.\n\nI need to assess whether these events collectively indicate malicious behavior or if they're just normal. While there are some points that stand out, like the PowerShell activity and the missing process in one event, they don't provide enough evidence of an attack. It's possible that the user was simply performing routine tasks, using Chrome normally, and perhaps running a script with PowerShell.\n\nTherefore, while I'm cautious about the PowerShell file creation, without more context or additional indicators of compromise (like known malicious domains in DNS queries or unusual registry edits), it's hard to conclude that this batch is definitively malicious. The confidence level isn't extremely high, but there's enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry writes and network connections from chrome.exe, which may indicate unusual activity, along with PowerShell creating a file in the Downloads folder.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. I'm looking at each JSON object to understand the overall activity.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. That seems normal since it's likely part of the log rotation or configuration. The next event is powershell.exe creating a file named estrutura_ativo.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be interesting.\n\nThere's an empty event with \"None\" values, which might just be noise or an error. Then winlogbeat.exe creates the same .winlogbeat.yml.new again. Consistent with logging processes but something to note if it happens too frequently.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe accessing a process and then whoami.exe being run without any arguments. Whoami is typically used to get system information, so unless there's malicious intent here, it's not suspicious on its own. But seeing multiple instances of process access in PowerShell could hint at potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe cmd.exe command catches my attention. The command line shows a deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks. Deleting tasks can be part of cleaning up after an attack or persistence mechanisms. This is a red flag because legitimate admins might use such commands, but in the context of multiple deletions and combined with other events, it raises concern.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event setting registry values stands out. Modifying the registry can be part of creating persistent backdoors or altering system configurations maliciously. The fact that svchost.exe is also modifying registry objects adds to this suspicion, as svchost is often used by malware for its legitimate processes but could indicate something more if combined with other activities.\n\nMultiple schtasks.exe creations and deletions are happening here. Scheduled tasks are common for both system operations and malicious purposes like creating persistent tasks. The fact that these commands are being executed from different processes (cmd, schtasks.exe) might be an attempt to remove traces or establish new persistence points.\n\nThere's a conhost.exe event modifying the registry as well. Conhost is often associated with command-line tools, but again, combined with other activities, it could indicate something more nefarious.\n\nPowerShell accessing processes multiple times without clear purpose and setting registry values further solidifies the idea that someone might be using PowerShell for malicious scripting, such as downloading additional tools or executing commands to compromise the system.\n\nPutting this all together: we have a series of events involving process creation, file operations, and registry modifications across several legitimate but commonly abused processes like PowerShell, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and whoami.exe. These actions could be indicative of an attacker performing reconnaissance, establishing persistence, or executing malicious activities.\n\nWhile each event alone might not be suspicious enough to warrant investigation, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The use of multiple tools, deletion of scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and repeated process accesses all point towards possible compromise attempts.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the sequence and types of events don't align with typical user activity patterns but instead resemble tactics used in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including file creation, process access, registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence level.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event step by step.\n\n1. **Event 1**: cmd.exe is being executed with a command line that tries to delete notepad.exe using wmic. This looks suspicious because deleting processes via command line can be a tactic used in malware or malicious scripts. The fact that it's redirecting output to nul might indicate an attempt to hide the process.\n\n2. **Event 2**: powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers for its powerful scripting capabilities. Access alone isn't bad, but combined with other events could be a red flag.\n\n3. **Event 3**: cmd.exe again, this time setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that malware uses to maintain access.\n\n4. **Event 4**: WMIC.exe is creating a process and deleting notepad.exe. WMIC is another tool often used for remote commands and can be abused by attackers. Using it to delete processes could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or terminate legitimate tools like antivirus.\n\n5. **Events 5,6,7**: These show WMIC loading various DLLs. Loading system DLLs is normal, but specific ones might be loaded maliciously. For example, if these are part of a larger attack chain, they might be indicators of compromise.\n\n6. **Event 8**: powershell.exe accessing something again. This repetition with other events could suggest scripting or automated behavior.\n\n7. **Events 9-14**: These show multiple processes accessing or creating entries in the registry and deleting user accounts via cmd.exe and net.exe. Deleting users, especially admins like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and others, is concerning. Such actions are often part of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\n8. **Events 15-20**: More instances of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and other tools being used to delete users or modify registry entries. The repeated use of these commands across multiple events suggests a concerted effort, possibly by an attacker trying to remove user accounts as part of a cleanup operation after compromising the system.\n\nPutting this all together, I notice several red flags:\n- Use of cmd.exe with wmic to delete processes.\n- Multiple instances of deleting user accounts using net.exe and cmd.exe.\n- Repeated access to powershell.exe and other tools that are often used in attacks.\n- Registry modifications which could be part of persistence or malicious configuration.\n\nThe combination of these activities over multiple events suggests potential malicious behavior, possibly indicating a compromise where an attacker is attempting to delete traces of their activity or escalate privileges. The confidence level is high because the pattern of using multiple tools and commands aligns with common attack tactics.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including deletion of processes, user accounts, and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting attacks. The command lines are not shown for some of these, so that's concerning. Then there are several cmd.exe processes deleting users like \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\". Deleting user accounts, especially ones with Admin suffixes, might indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable accounts.\n\nI also see a few net.exe, net1.exe, and sc.exe commands being used. These tools are typically for network and service management but can be misused. For example, deleting the 'win32times' service could disrupt system operations, which is suspicious in a batch of logs. Additionally, services.exe interacting with the registry might suggest tampering with system configurations.\n\nThe log shows multiple RegistryEvent tasks across various processes. Unusual registry modifications are often part of malicious activities, like creating or deleting keys to maintain persistence or alter system settings. The combination of these events makes me think there's a coordinated attack happening, possibly involving credential theft, service disruption, or system configuration changes.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of administrative tools and multiple registry changes without clear legitimate context raise red flags.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a legitimate system tool used to display user information. It doesn't seem suspicious on its own, but repeated executions could be worth noting if it's out of the ordinary for the system.\n\nThen, I notice several events involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers because it can execute commands and scripts. The tasks include accessing processes, setting registry values, and loading images. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious but could be indicators depending on their frequency or context.\n\nThere's a command line in one event: \"cmd.exe \/c del %temp%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt >nul 2>&1 & del %temp%\\\\estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe >nul 2>&1\". This seems like a command to delete specific files in the temp directory. Deleting files can be part of normal cleanup, but if these files are related to malicious activities, it might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nLooking at the file paths, one deletion is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\". The filename includes \"calc\" which sometimes is a hint that it's trying to obfuscate or relate to legitimate tools. Decoding 'tarefa_secundario' translates to something like 'secondary task' in Portuguese, suggesting maybe this file was part of some malicious process.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the repeated use of 'powershell.exe & {}' in command lines, which seems odd. Typically, you wouldn't have an empty script block like that unless it's part of a larger command or used to execute something else, possibly malicious code.\n\nThe events also show registry value sets. Malware often manipulates the registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations, so multiple writes could be suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these points together: repeated powershell executions with various actions, attempts to delete specific files that might have been malicious, andregistry modifications—this batch seems to indicate potential malicious activity. The combination of process creations, file deletions, and registry changes is common in attack patterns, like during payload execution or cleanup phases.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear signs that this is a legitimate system operation, especially since the same processes are being accessed and modified multiple times, which might be unusual for normal user activities. Therefore, it's likely that this batch of events should be classified as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated PowerShell executions, registry modifications, and attempts to delete files potentially related to malicious processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script injection. The initial events show ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs, which could be part of normal operations, but combined with other actions might indicate something more malicious.\n\nNext, there are file creation and deletion events from the same user (fiddelis). Specifically, a file is created in the Temp directory and then deleted shortly after. This pattern seems suspicious because it's common for attackers to create temporary files and delete them to avoid detection.\n\nThen, I see multiple instances of Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations, which is concerning.\n\nThere are also several Process Create events for whoami.exe. While whoami is a legitimate tool, its repeated use without clear purpose could indicate it's being used to gather information about the user's permissions or environment, possibly as part of reconnaissance.\n\nAdditionally, there are numerous ProcessAccess events related to powershell.exe and other processes. This could mean that one process is accessing another's memory space, which might be a sign of process injection or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the file paths, especially the temporary PowerShell script file, it suggests some scripting activity. The fact that the script is deleted after creation adds to the suspicion of attempting to hide traces.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file and registry manipulations, along with process creations and accesses, indicates potential malicious behavior. It's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell for command execution or lateral movement within the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe loading DLLs, creating\/deleting files in Temp directory, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access could be suspicious. But looking closer, the task associated with these events is 'Process accessed', which might just indicate that another process interacted with it, not necessarily malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several instances of whoami.exe being run. Whoami is a standard tool to display user information, and seeing it multiple times isn't unusual unless it's part of a larger pattern. However, in this case, it seems isolated to just process creation events without any other concerning actions.\n\nI also see RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. Runtime Broker is related to Windows User Account Control, so some registry activity from it might be normal, depending on what exactly was changed. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nNotepad.exe and Calculator.exe are both standard system tools. Their involvement in registry events or loading DLLs could be part of legitimate operations. Notably, Calculator.exe is known to sometimes load URLMON.DLL for certain functionalities, which doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nThere are entries from svchost.exe modifying the registry multiple times. Svchost is a generic host process for services, and while some malware can abuse it, repeated registry changes alone don't confirm malicious activity without additional indicators like unusual service creation or network traffic.\n\nLooking at the winlogbeat.exe entry, it's creating a file in its own directory, which seems related to log shipping or monitoring. This is more likely benign unless there are signs of tampering with the logs themselves.\n\nThe Chrome.exe events show DNS queries and network connections, which are typical behaviors for a browser. However, multiple network connections could be concerning if they're connecting to known malicious domains, but without that information, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting all these together, while some activities individually might raise eyebrows, collectively there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern of malicious behavior. The events are mostly standard system processes performing their usual tasks or legitimate operations. There's no evidence of unusual file creation, deletion, or network communication with known bad domains. Therefore, the batch as a whole doesn't indicate something interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of normal system processes and activities without clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
