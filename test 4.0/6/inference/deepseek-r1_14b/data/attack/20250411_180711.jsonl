One event shows PowerShell accessing process information, another modifying the registry, which is common but worth noting. The critical point is the command line in one of the events: it's using a script that XOR-encodes some data and sends it to example.com. This looks like an attempt to encode and send sensitive information, possibly exfiltrating data.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load events from PowerShell, which might be part of legitimate operations but could also indicate loading malicious modules. The creation and deletion of a temporary .ps1 file in the Temp directory is concerning—it suggests the execution of a script that's then cleaned up to avoid detection. This behavior is often seen in malware or attack scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the combination of PowerShell activity with encoded data transmission and file manipulation raises red flags.

It looks like they're encoding some plaintext into ciphertext using XOR encryption with a static key. They're also making an HTTP POST request to example.com.\n\nXOR cipher isn't very strong, so it might be part of obfuscation tactics. Repeated similar commands could indicate scripting or automated behavior, which is suspicious.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is being executed with a command line that includes some encoded data. The command seems to be encoding plaintext into ciphertext using XOR encryption. The plaintext contains \"Path\" followed by a path to a user directory. Then it sends this encrypted data via an HTTP POST request to example.com. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and sending potentially sensitive information over the network without proper context might indicate exfiltration.\n\nNext, there are events where `powershell.exe` loads various DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. These are legitimate Windows components, so that's not inherently bad, but combined with other actions, it could be part of a larger malicious script execution.\n\nI notice multiple instances where different processes (like RuntimeBroker.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe) are modifying the registry or creating files. Some of these might be normal system operations, but others could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is likely related to log shipping and not malicious. However, it's good to check if any anomalies exist in that context.\n\nLooking at the frequency: powershell.exe appears multiple times with similar command lines. Repetitive execution of the same script could be part of a loop or scheduled task, which might indicate a persistent threat.\n\nThe DNS query event is for example.com, which could be a domain used for command and control (C2) communication. If this domain is known malicious, that would raise red flags.\n\nThe fact that multiple processes are accessing the registry and files could be signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network, common in advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\nConsidering all these points together: suspicious PowerShell activity with encoding and data exfiltration, repeated process executions, and potential C2 communication. While some events might be benign on their own, the combination suggests possible malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing encoded commands and sending data to example.com, along with other suspicious activities like registry modifications and file creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are from different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe all performing Registry value set tasks. That catches my eye because these standard system processes shouldn't be making registry changes unless something is amiss. Typically, legitimate software doesn't modify the registry in such a way, especially across multiple processes.\n\nThen there's an event from chrome.exe creating a pipe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but I'm not sure if this is normal behavior for Chrome. It also has several Registry value sets and image loads, including loading a DLL which could be suspicious if it's unexpected or known malicious software.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessed and performing registry operations. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and persistence, so repeated access and registry modifications are red flags. There's even an event where powershell.exe deletes a specific file using a command line argument that includes removing a .bat script from a temporary directory. This deletion could be part of cleaning up traces or evading detection.\n\nAnother process, whoami.exe, is run without any arguments. While whoami is usually harmless, its use without parameters might not be standard and could indicate testing user privileges or lateral movement.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's downloads directory. If this is part of legitimate log shipping, it might be normal, but if it's unexpected behavior, it could signal data exfiltration or logging for malicious activities.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple processes making registry changes, powershell.exe being used with potentially malicious commands, deletion of specific files, and an unusual use of whoami. These collectively suggest possible malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms, credential dumping, or file deletion to cover tracks. The combination of events across different processes and the nature of their actions raises concerns about a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including registry modifications by non-standard processes, PowerShell command execution, file deletion attempts, and potentially malicious image loads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, several entries are from powershell.exe with tasks like Image loaded and File created. These could be normal operations since PowerShell often loads various DLLs when running scripts. The files mentioned seem to be standard .NET framework components and Windows Defender modules, which don't immediately raise red flags.\n\nThere's a file creation of 'estrutura_temporario.txt' by powershell.exe. Temporary files are common, so this might not be suspicious unless the filename or path is unusual. Here, it looks like a temporary structure file, which could be part of legitimate processes.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome does modify the registry for settings and extensions, doing this repeatedly in quick succession might be worth noting, but on its own, it's not necessarily malicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nLooking further, I see a series of FileDeleteDetected events by powershell.exe, deleting specific .bat files. The command lines show that these are scripts being removed from various paths. This could indicate script execution or cleanup, but without context on what the scripts did, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe last few entries again have powershell.exe removing files with long command lines specifying different batch files. Each removal targets a specific script in various directories. The use of \"-Force\" and \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" suggests that these are intentional actions, possibly part of a script execution or cleanup process. However, this behavior could also be indicative of malicious activity trying to remove evidence.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe loading standard DLLs, creating temporary files, deleting specific scripts after creation—this might be part of a legitimate script's operation. But the repeated deletions across different paths and the use of forceful deletion without errors could hint at something more nefarious. Additionally, multiple chrome.exe registry writes in quick succession might indicate unusual activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards it being interesting because while some actions are normal, others like the deletions after creation and the repeated registry changes don't fit typical user behavior. There's a potential for malicious intent here, so further investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes loading various DLLs, creating temporary files, and deleting specific scripts shortly after their creation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell and cmd.exe processes being executed. Specifically, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is running with command lines that involve removing files. For example, the commands like Remove-Item are used to delete specific .bat files in different directories. That could be suspicious because deleting scripts might indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable certain functionalities.\n\nThen, I see several events where cmd.exe and sc.exe are used. The command line for one of the cmd.exe processes is \"\/c sc.exe stop objeto_temporario>nul 2>&1 & sc.exe delete estrutura_secundario>nul 2>&1\". This looks like it's stopping and deleting a service named \"objeto_temporario\" and another called \"estrutura_secundario.\" Using sc.exe to manage services can be part of legitimate administration, but in this context, especially after seeing the PowerShell deletions, it raises flags. It might be an attempt to remove services or disable them as part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are events where processes like conhost.exe and whoami.exe are created. Conhost.exe is often used by PowerShell for its console host, so that's not unusual on its own. However, paired with the other activities, it might contribute to obfuscating the process or creating a more persistent backdoor.\n\nAnother point is the use of Registry events across multiple processes. Both powershell.exe and cmd.exe are modifying the registry—setting values and adding\/removing objects. This could be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations in a way that's hard to track, which is common in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events in PowerShell's StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Creating files here might be an attempt to store malicious scripts or configurations that run every time PowerShell starts, making it harder to detect and remove.\n\nConsidering all these events together:\n1. Multiple deletions of .bat files using PowerShell.\n2. Use of cmd.exe with sc.exe to stop and delete services.\n3. Registry modifications across various processes.\n4. File creation in a non-standard location for PowerShell profiles.\n\nEach individual event could be innocent, but the combination suggests a pattern of malicious activity aimed at removing evidence, stopping services, modifying system configurations, and potentially establishing persistence. The fact that these actions are spread across different processes and tools (PowerShell, cmd.exe, sc.exe) makes it harder to detect each step in isolation but raises concerns when viewed as a whole.\n\nI'm also thinking about the confidence level here. While not all events are conclusive on their own, the sequence and combination of process creations, file deletions, service modifications, and registry changes point towards potential malicious activity. However, without more context or additional indicators like known malicious IPs or timestamps showing a rapid sequence of suspicious actions, the confidence isn't 100%. But given the nature of the commands and their implications, it's definitely in the realm of possibilities that this batch is related to an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing Remove-Item commands to delete .bat files, use of cmd.exe with sc.exe to stop and delete services, registry modifications across processes, and file creation in non-standard locations suggest potential malicious activity aiming to remove evidence or establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is accessing processes and modifying registry values. That could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's being accessed repeatedly might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThen, there's a cmd.exe process deleting a file in the Temp directory. Deleting files can be part of normal operations, but the way it's done here—using del with specific flags and redirecting output to null—might suggest an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after some activity. This is worth noting because sometimes attackers delete logs or other files to avoid detection.\n\nNext, I see conhost.exe accessing registry values. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process, but any unusual activity from it could be concerning. It's another layer that might be part of malicious behavior, especially if combined with other events.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution stands out because it's commonly used to check user privileges or gather information about the system. If this is being run without a clear purpose, it could be an early step in reconnaissance for potential attacks.\n\nLooking further down, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, which show various DLLs being loaded. This might not immediately seem suspicious, but when combined with other activities like file creation and deletion, it could indicate that PowerShell is executing scripts or loading modules as part of a malicious payload.\n\nThen, I notice the creation of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1) followed by its deletion. This pattern is often seen in attempts to bypass certain security policies or test execution policies. The quick creation and deletion could be an attempt to avoid detection or remove evidence, which raises the alarm.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of PowerShell accessing resources, deleting files, running whoami for system info, and creating\/deleting a temp script—these behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity.

This could be legitimate, but I should note that PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, so repeated events might be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's an ImageLoad event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from a Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Defender uses PowerShell for some scans.\n\nAnother FileCreate event by powershell.exe in the user profile's Startup folder catches my eye. Creating files here could indicate attempts to persist across reboots, which is a red flag.\n\nThere are several RegistryEvent tasks where both powershell.exe and cmd.exe set registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes for malicious activities.\n\nA ProcessAccess event on whoami.exe by powershell.exe might show information gathering. Whoami is often used to check user permissions, which could be a step in an attack.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command deleting modulo_base.exe from the Temp folder. This deletion might be trying to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity.\n\nOther events include more ProcessCreate and RegistryEvent tasks, but it's hard to tell without more context if they're part of normal operations.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious actions like registry modifications, file creation in startup folders, process access on whoami.exe, and deletion of a potentially malicious file.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user has provided a series of events in JSONL format, each with process details, Windows log information, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve powershell.exe, which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell to execute commands or scripts that can't be easily detected.\n\nLooking deeper, several entries show the command line as \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This seems suspicious because it's trying to remove files from the TEMP directory. Attackers might delete log files to cover their tracks or erase evidence of their activities.\n\nThere are multiple instances where the same command is executed, which could indicate a script being run repeatedly. Repeating commands can be a sign of automated malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1\" in the TEMP directory. This is concerning because it suggests that PowerShell is executing scripts in the temporary folder, which is a common tactic for evading detection. The script might be testing permissions or performing actions that are logged, hence the file's deletion afterward.\n\nThe events also show various system activities like image loading and registry access. These could be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with the other suspicious indicators, they add to the concern. For example, accessing the registry and loading multiple DLLs might be part of a broader malicious process.\n\nAnother point is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks in the logs. This repetition could indicate that a script or service is being started or stopped multiple times, which might not be normal user behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands, file deletions, and multiple system interactions—it's highly likely that this batch of events indicates malicious activity. The combination suggests an attack where the actor is trying to execute commands stealthily, possibly attempting to remove logs or evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file deletions and repeated command executions suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. But I need to analyze the specific actions here.\n\nThe first event has a command line that deletes a file called key.log in the TEMP directory. Deleting files isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it might be suspicious. It's using powershell.exe with a command to remove an item and ignoring errors, which could mean they're trying to hide if the file doesn't exist.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe is loading different DLLs. This is normal for PowerShell as it runs scripts that might require various libraries, but sometimes attackers load malicious modules or use reflective DLL injection. I don't see anything obviously malicious in the paths provided, though.\n\nThere's a file creation event in the StartupProfileData directory. That seems related to PowerShell's profile, which can be used for persistence. If an attacker adds their script there, it would run every time PowerShell starts. The fact that this is happening multiple times could indicate some automation or malicious activity trying to establish persistence.\n\nAnother event shows a registry value being set. Again, setting registry values with powershell.exe is common but can also be used for persistence mechanisms like adding a run key or modifying system settings to allow unsigned scripts. This might be part of an attempt to maintain access after reboot.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe execution. Using such tools could be part of reconnaissance to gather information about the current user and privileges, which is often a step in early attacks before moving laterally.\n\nI also notice multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs. While this is normal, attackers sometimes load malicious modules or use legitimate ones in unexpected ways. The specific paths here seem okay, but I should be cautious.\n\nA file named __PSScriptPolicyTest was created and then deleted. This might be a test script to bypass certain policies, which could indicate an attempt to check if the system allows execution of unsigned scripts. If this is part of a larger script, it might be trying to ensure persistence by testing the environment's restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, there are PipeCreated events, which could be used for communication between processes. Malware sometimes uses pipes for command and control or to inject code into other processes.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated powershell.exe activity, file deletions in TEMP, attempts to create files in startup directories, registry modifications, whoami execution, and script testing. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious activity.

Let's look through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events where the process is powershell.exe with command_line showing something like 'powershell.exe & {}'. The task in winlog is either Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle. This seems normal because PowerShell often interacts with these components for proper functioning. But I should check if repeated calls without a clear purpose might be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe accesses files, creates files, and modifies the registry. For example, one event shows MpClient.dll being loaded, which is related to Windows Defender. Another creates a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory. These could be legitimate activities if part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for scripting malicious actions.\n\nThen I notice events involving conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost is typically used by command-line tools like PowerShell, so that's not unusual on its own. The whoami.exe process creates are straightforward since it's a system utility to get user information, which could be part of legitimate scripts or checks.\n\nThere are multiple Process Create events for both powershell.exe and whoami.exe. While this is common in environments where scripts run frequently, the volume might raise an eyebrow. Especially if these processes don't correlate with known scheduled tasks or user activities.\n\nLooking at file operations, there's a FileCreate event by winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That makes sense since it's likely part of log shipping or monitoring tools setting up their configurations. No red flags here.\n\nThe Registry value set events could be for configuration purposes, but again, without knowing the specific changes made, it's hard to say if they're malicious. Sometimes attackers use registry modifications for persistence.\n\nI'm also noticing that many events don't have a file path or show None for files. This might mean that the activities are process-related and not directly accessing files, which could be normal but could also indicate script-based activity without persistent storage changes.\n\nConsidering all these points together: repeated PowerShell executions with various tasks, some legitimate-looking file and registry interactions, and occasional whoami.exe runs. It's a bit of a mix, but nothing screams obviously malicious. However, the volume and types of activities might suggest potential lateral movement or recon if not explained by normal system operations.\n\nSince there are no clear indicators like failed logins, known malicious file hashes, or unusual network activity mentioned, I'm leaning towards it being NOT INTERESTING.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the initial events are all about powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. So multiple accesses might raise some flags. But looking deeper, they don't have any command lines or file accesses mentioned—just that it was accessed.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run with the default path. Whoami is usually benign and just shows user info, so that seems normal unless it's part of a larger sequence.\n\nI also see events where powershell.exe accesses the registry. That can be tricky because powershell scripts often interact with the registry for legitimate reasons, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity trying to modify system settings.\n\nAnother thing is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for log management, so that's expected and probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting this all together: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed without any clear indication of what it's doing beyond just the process start. The registry access could be concerning, but without more context like actual writes or deletions, it's hard to say.
