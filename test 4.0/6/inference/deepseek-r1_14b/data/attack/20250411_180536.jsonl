{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few lines are all from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity, especially DNS lookups and connections as part of browsing.\n\nThen there are multiple events where the process is None and winlog task is None. Those might be noise or system-level events that aren't meaningful on their own.\n\nNext, I see 'powershell.exe' being accessed and creating processes. PowerShell can be legitimate but it's also commonly used in attacks because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines aren't provided here, so I don't know the exact commands run. However, just accessing it without malicious commands might not be suspicious.\n\nLooking at 'whoami.exe', that's a standard tool for checking user information, so that doesn't raise flags unless used inappropriately.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value sets by various processes like 'services.exe' and others. These could indicate legitimate system operations or they might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access. It depends on what exactly is being set in the registry.\n\nI also notice several process creations for 'cmd.exe' and 'sc.exe'. They're commonly used for command-line tasks, but again, if they're creating services (as seen with sc.exe), this could be a sign of setting up malicious services for persistence. The command lines show creating and starting services, which can be part of installing malware.\n\nThe last few events are about images being loaded by various executables into memory. These DLLs seem related to .NET framework components, which are legitimate. However, sometimes attackers might load malicious libraries that mimic or use existing legitimate ones.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The PowerShell and Registry activity could be concerning, especially if combined with the service creation using sc.exe. These might indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or deploy malware. However, without more context like unusual command lines or file accesses, it's hard to say definitively. But given that multiple processes are involved in creating services and registry modifications, I would classify this as interesting due to possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving process creations, PowerShell access, and Registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event is tarefa_logico.exe loading mscorlib.ni.dll. That seems normal because those are common .NET libraries. Next, estrutura_principal.exe loads clrjit.dll, which I recognize as part of the .NET framework too. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there are several cmd.exe and other executables like conhost.exe accessing registry values. Registry access is common for configuration, but when multiple different processes do it, especially in quick succession, it might be worth noting. But on its own, it's not necessarily malicious unless combined with other behaviors.\n\nLooking at the next entries, I see winlogbeat.exe creating a file related to its configuration. That makes sense if it's an agent running. The same goes for powershell.exe accessing registry and process events. Now, multiple instances of powershell.exe doing similar actions could be concerning because PowerShell is often used in scripting or attacks.\n\nThere are also entries where calc.exe and Calculator.exe load urlmon.dll. Urlmon is a legitimate Windows component, but sometimes attackers use known processes to hide their activities. The repeated use of these executables might warrant closer inspection.\n\nAdditionally, svchost.exe accessing registry multiple times. Svchost is a common host process for services, but again, when it's doing a lot of registry activity, especially unusual ones, it could be an indicator of something malicious like persistence mechanisms or service manipulation.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several normal activities like .NET loading and legitimate processes accessing the registry. However, the multiple PowerShell executions and repeated calc.exe\/Calculator.exe with urlmon.dll might indicate potential script execution or lateral movement. The svchost.exe actions could be part of a broader attack vector, such as installing backdoors or creating persistence.\n\nWhile each event individually isn't necessarily malicious, the combination—especially the PowerShell and multiple registry accesses across different processes—raises flags. This could signal an ongoing attack where attackers are setting up persistence points, using legitimate tools inappropriately.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry access events by various processes including powershell.exe and svchost.exe may indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.
