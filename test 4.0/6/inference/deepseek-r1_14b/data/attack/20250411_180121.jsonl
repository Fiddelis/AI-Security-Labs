{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. So first, I'll go through each event one by one and look for patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of network activities. But then I notice that after a few of these, there's an entry from powershell.exe creating a new process. The command line looks suspicious: it's using DownloadFile from a WebClient object to fetch something from GitHub.\n\nHmm, why would PowerShell be downloading files? Legitimate uses are possible, but the URLs point to repositories like 'modulo_temporario' and 'unidade_base', which I don't recognize as standard or common names. Also, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various image files. That's a bit concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother red flag is the creation and deletion of temporary files in the AppData directory. The file paths like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1\" seem arbitrary, which is common when trying to avoid detection. And then there are multiple events where powershell.exe is downloading different files from various GitHub repositories. This could be a sign of script execution or module dropping.\n\nI also notice that the command lines in some events don't have the 'name' field for the process anymore; instead, they only show the command line directly. That might be an attempt to obfuscate or hide the process name, which is another tactic used by attackers.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple network connections from Chrome are normal, but the powershell.exe activities with file downloads and deletions, along with registry modifications, suggest potential malicious behavior. The repeated downloading of files from different GitHub repositories adds up to a higher risk. So overall, this batch does look interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including file downloads from external sources and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, I notice several events where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that download files from GitHub repositories. The URLs are pointing to different branches and files like LICENSE.txt. That catches my attention because PowerShell scripts downloading files can be a red flag for malicious activity, especially if they're fetching code directly from random GitHub repos.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field, most of these events are under 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. The fact that multiple powershell.exe processes are involved and each is performing a DownloadFile operation suggests possible automated or script-based behavior. It's not typical user activity, which makes me suspicious.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost.exe is often used by command-line tools, but combined with the other events, it might be part of some malicious process execution.\n\nAnother point is that some processes are creating files in specific locations, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads. Writing to user directories without explicit permission could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry value sets from chrome.exe and conhost.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes for its settings, doing so repeatedly might be unusual unless it's part of a broader attack vector trying to maintain persistence across sessions.\n\nThe DNS query event is a bit generic, but when combined with the file downloads, it adds to the narrative of potentially malicious behavior as attackers often use domains that aren't commonly visited.\n\nLastly, an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file might be benign if this tool is installed, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, given all the other suspicious activities, it's another piece of the puzzle.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances downloading files, several registry modifications, and file creations in user directories—this batch seems indicative of potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high because these behaviors are common in attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing script downloads from GitHub repositories, combined with registry modifications and file creations, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this analysis. I've got a batch of system log events to look through. The goal is to determine if these logs are interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious activities like executing scripts and commands. The presence of multiple 'powershell.exe' processes might raise some flags, especially since it's appearing so frequently.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes: there are file creations, process accesses, and registry modifications. For example, one entry shows that powershell.exe accessed a process, which could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system. Another event has powershell.exe setting a registry value—this is concerning because attackers often use registry keys to maintain persistence.\n\nThen there's 'cmd.exe' showing up multiple times with specific command lines. One cmd.exe instance runs SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F, which deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". This could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity or prevent the task from executing again. Another cmd.exe entry has the command-line \"\/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1\", which is similar—again targeting the same task.\n\nThe 'schtasks.exe' process also appears, creating a new scheduled task. This could be part of an attack chain where attackers create or modify tasks to run malicious code at specific times, achieving persistence on the system.\n\nOther notable entries include 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'Calculator.exe', and 'whoami.exe'. While these are standard processes, their involvement in registry modifications or unexpected actions could indicate they're being exploited as part of a larger attack. For instance, 'whoami.exe' is typically used to display user information, but if it's being executed from an unusual location or with other commands, it might signal something malicious.\n\nThe fact that multiple different processes are making changes to the registry and file system, especially in a coordinated manner, suggests potential malicious activity. Attackers often use a combination of techniques—like deleting scheduled tasks, modifying registry entries, and using legitimate tools like SCHTASKS— to cover their tracks or establish persistence.\n\nWhile I don't have all the context about the environment these logs are from, such as whether 'powershell.exe' is commonly used there, the frequency and nature of these events do raise red flags. The combination of process creation, file operations, registry modifications, and task deletions points towards possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\n\nIn summary, this batch of logs shows multiple signs that could be indicative of an attack: repeated use of powershell.exe for potentially malicious tasks, deletion of scheduled tasks to avoid detection, and registry modifications which are often part of persistence mechanisms. Therefore, the events are likely interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe suggest potential malicious activity such as process creation, file operations, and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what they're telling me.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of entries involving conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe. These seem like common tools but could be used for malicious purposes if combined in certain ways.\n\nLooking at the tasks mentioned: \"Registry value set\", \"Process accessed\", \"Process Create\", and others. The Registry operations are especially interesting because attackers often use them to maintain persistence or modify system settings.\n\nI see multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed, sometimes with command lines that don't look standard. For example, one line has \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems unusual—maybe it's trying to execute some code in a way that's not straightforward. Also, there are several events where the task is \"Provider Lifecycle\", which might indicate some PowerShell-specific activity.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe command deleting registry entries: \"REG DELETE...\". This could be an attempt to remove traces of other processes or to disable certain system features. Additionally, reg.exe is used to delete and modify registry keys, which is another red flag because attackers often manipulate the registry for persistence.\n\nThe events involving whoami.exe might be used to gather information about the user, which is common in reconnaissance activities. The repeated use of powershell.exe could be part of a script or automated process, potentially trying to hide malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several signs that these processes might not be normal user activity. Multiple instances of the same tools being used with specific tasks could indicate an attack. However, without more context on the baseline behavior of the system, it's hard to be certain. Still, the combination of registry modifications, process creations, and unusual PowerShell commands is concerning enough to merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with potentially suspicious command lines, along with registry modifications and process creations that may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve powershell.exe. That's a common tool but can also be used maliciously. The events show powershell.exe loading various .NET framework files, which isn't unusual on its own since PowerShell often uses these for scripting. There are multiple ImageLoad tasks, which just means the system is tracking when images (DLLs or EXEs) are loaded.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 in the Temp directory. This seems like it could be a test script, maybe checking policy settings. But then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's interesting because creating and deleting temporary files can be part of malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are events related to Pipe Created and Engine Lifecycle for PowerShell. These might indicate some communication between processes or module loading, but without more context, it's hard to tell if they're suspicious.\n\nAnother event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so that seems benign unless there's something unusual about the path or permissions.\n\nThere are also instances where other processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe are created. Using these tools can be normal but could also be part of an attack chain. For example, cmd.exe being run with \/c might execute a command and then terminate, which is common in scripts or malicious activities to avoid persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Registry value sets by both PowerShell and cmd.exe. This could be for persistence mechanisms, modifying system settings, or other configurations that might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances loading various DLLs, creating a temporary script which is then deleted, and using command-line tools like whoami and cmd with \/c suggest possible malicious activity. The combination of these events could be part of an attack where the script tests system policies, creates persistence mechanisms via registry changes, and uses pipes for communication without leaving evidence by deleting the temp file.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show suspicious activity including temporary file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and command-line tool usage indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. So, the first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated instances could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. **cmd.exe** setting a registry value. That's not unusual on its own since many system processes modify the registry.\n2. **conhost.exe** doing the same as cmd.exe—also normal, especially for console applications.\n3. **powershell.exe** accessing process information. This is a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used to gather information about running processes, which might be part of reconnaissance.\n4. **whoami.exe** being executed. Again, not inherently malicious, but could indicate an attempt to identify the current user, which might be part of privilege escalation or data collection.\n5. More instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. The repetition here raises suspicion as attackers often use persistence mechanisms involving these activities.\n6. Powershell creating and then deleting a file in the Temp directory. This seems like it could be related to script execution, possibly testing permissions or trying to bypass certain security policies.\n7. Registry modifications by ApplicationFrameHost.exe might not stand out, but combined with other powershell activity, it's worth monitoring.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple process creations and accesses, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory—all are indicators that could point towards malicious behavior. Powershell is a favorite tool for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands directly. The repeated use here might be part of an attempt to establish persistence or spread within the system.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because of the combination of events, especially the powershell activities that could indicate malicious script execution or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe activity including registry modifications and file operations suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nFirst event is Calculator.exe setting a registry value. Not too unusual on its own, but sometimes normal apps do that.\n\nNext is powershell.exe creating a pipe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused. Creating pipes could be part of communication between processes, which might be malicious.\n\nAnother one from powershell.exe setting a registry value. This seems repetitive—multiple events with similar actions from the same process. That's something to note.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accessing another process. Process access can indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nChrome.exe creating a pipe and multiple registry writes. Chrome is a browser; it might write to the registry for updates or settings. But seeing this so many times (seven events) seems excessive—maybe something's amiss.\n\nAnother Calculator event, then two more from chrome.exe writing to the registry. Again, lots of registry activity which could be suspicious.\n\nThen there are processes like conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost is usually benign but sometimes used in command-line attacks. Whoami is typically for user info, so seeing it might not be bad unless part of a larger sequence.\n\nLooking at the last events, powershell.exe creates a process with a command line that includes removing a file in %TEMP%. That's interesting—deleting files could be to cover tracks or as part of some malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe doing various actions like creating pipes, accessing processes, writing to the registry. The deletion script is concerning. Also, chrome.exe making many changes might indicate a compromised extension or exploit. Overall, this batch shows signs of potential malicious behavior, especially with powershell's involvement and file deletions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications, process access, and file creation\/deletion.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user wants me to analyze all the events together and decide whether the whole batch is something that needs attention.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. Each line is a JSON object representing an event, which includes details about a process, Windows log task, and a file path or other info.\n\nStarting with the first few events: they all involve powershell.exe loading various DLLs. That's normal because PowerShell often loads different components when it runs scripts. The files mentioned are system-related, likeclr.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. So these initial events don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, I see an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the TEMP directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1\". Then, almost immediately after, there's a File Delete logged event for the same file. This looks like PowerShell is creating and then deleting a script file, which could be part of some automated process or testing. However, in some cases, this might be a way to execute malicious scripts without leaving a trace on disk. But since it's named PSScriptPolicyTest, it might be related to PowerShell's own scripting policies, so maybe not inherently bad.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is removing files from the TEMP directory using Remove-Item cmdlets. Each of these commands targets different zip files like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. This seems like someone or something is cleaning up temporary files. But it's a bit concerning because deleting multiple temp files could be part of data exfiltration or covering tracks after an attack.\n\nAnother point is that the command lines for these Remove-Item calls are similar but with different file names each time. The use of \"&\" in the command line suggests chaining commands, which is normal in PowerShell scripting. However, the fact that it's removing specific files might raise an eyebrow if these files were created by other processes or if their presence is unexpected.\n\nThere are also events involving chrome.exe loading DLLs and making registry changes. These seem standard for a browser process and don't indicate any malicious activity on their own. They're probably just Chrome's normal operations, maybe updates or configuration changes.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, powershell.exe is involved in multiple file deletions from TEMP, which could be suspicious. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting, it's also a favorite tool for attackers due to its extensive capabilities and how it can execute code without leaving obvious traces. The combination of creating a script file only to delete it and then deleting several other temp files might suggest some malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider if these actions are part of a legitimate process. For instance, during system cleanup or automated testing, scripts might remove temporary files. But the specific names like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" could hint at something related to policy testing, which is more of an internal process and not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe confidence level here is about 0.7. That's because while there are red flags like multiple file deletions and script creation\/deletion, there's no concrete evidence of malicious intent. It could be a benign automated process or part of a legitimate script execution flow.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involving file deletions in the TEMP directory may indicate potential malicious activity or attempts to remove traces.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, all these events are from a system log and they involve different processes, mostly PowerShell and some others like conhost.exe and whoami.exe.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that remove files in the TEMP directory. For example, \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\tarefa_base.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This seems suspicious because deleting files from the TEMP directory could be part of malicious activity to clean up traces. Malware often uses PowerShell for such tasks because it's a common tool and can fly under the radar.\n\nAlso, there are several events where Registry values are being set by PowerShell. Changing registry settings is another red flag because attackers might modify system configurations to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. The repeated attempts to set registry values could indicate an attacker trying different methods to ensure their changes stick.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script file in the TEMP directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\". Creating a temporary script might be part of executing malicious code, and then deleting it quickly suggests an attempt to avoid detection. The fact that the script was created and then deleted shortly after raises questions about its purpose.\n\nLooking at the processes, whoami.exe is used to get user information. While this can be legitimate, in the context of other suspicious activities like file deletions and registry changes, it might be part of a larger attack chain, such as reconnaissance before an actual breach.\n\nThe image loading events for various DLLs by PowerShell are normal since PowerShell often loads these libraries when running scripts or commands. However, combined with the other activities, it adds to the overall suspicion that something isn't right.\n\nI should also consider the frequency and combination of these events. Having multiple instances where files are being deleted and registry changes made, along with script creation\/deletion, seems coordinated rather than random background noise. This pattern is more indicative of an attack rather than normal system operations.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the repeated and varied malicious activities across different processes and tasks point towards potential malicious behavior that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file deletions, registry modifications, and temporary script creation\/deletion suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few entries are all from powershell.exe with command lines removing files in the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and deleting files can be part of an attack. The files being deleted have names like \"registro_auxiliar.txt\" which might not look harmful at first glance, but I should consider why they're being removed.\n\nLooking further, there are events where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the data directory. That seems normal if it's part of log management, but I'll keep an eye out for anything unusual with that process.\n\nThen there are several entries from chrome.exe making registry changes. While Chrome does interact with the registry, multiple such events could indicate something malicious, especially if they're frequent and not part of regular updates or extensions.\n\nThe whoami.exe processes creating new instances might be checking user permissions or system info, which is a common tactic for attackers to gather information about the system.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe accesses other processes and creates files. This could be an attempt to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell deletions, file creations by different processes, registry modifications from Chrome, and process access events stands out. These activities don't seem like normal user behavior and could indicate a potential attack or unauthorized system activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell deletions, file creations by different processes, registry modifications from Chrome, and process access events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' with the task being 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be a red flag because it's commonly exploited in malicious activities. The fact that it's accessed multiple times could be suspicious, especially if these accesses aren't part of normal user behavior.\n\nThen there are several instances where 'whoami.exe' is executed. Whoami is typically used to display information about the current user and can help determine if an account is being impersonated or if privileges have been escalated. The command line path seems standard, but repeated use might warrant investigation, especially if it's not a usual activity for that user.\n\nLooking at another entry, 'winlogbeat.exe' created a file in a data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack used for log management, so this could be normal if the system uses such tools. However, I should consider whether this activity aligns with expected behavior based on the organization's setup.\n\nThere's also a 'File created' event by powershell.exe pointing to 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename translates to \"active package\" in Portuguese, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of some script or process. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of PowerShell and whoami.exe stands out. While each event on its own might not be alarming, the combination suggests possible command and control activity or lateral movement within a network, which are common indicators of malicious behavior. However, without additional context like timestamps or source IPs, it's challenging to definitively classify these as malicious. They do raise enough flags to merit closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe access and whoami.exe execution suggest potential unauthorized activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
