{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's not unusual because browsers often interact with the Windows Registry. There are multiple events where chrome.exe is making changes, but without context on what exactly is being set, it's hard to say if that's suspicious. It could be normal updates or configurations.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. This is a legitimate system tool used to get user information. Unless it's being run in an unusual context or with elevated privileges, this might not raise red flags on its own. But combined with other events, it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe real focus here seems to be on powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administration tasks and malicious activities. I see several instances where powershell.exe is accessing files and processes. The command lines show that it's executing scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which sounds concerning because such a script name suggests it might be logging keystrokes—something a malicious actor would do to capture sensitive information.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe, which indicates it's being spawned multiple times. The command lines in some entries show that these PowerShell instances are executing scripts from specific paths on the system. This is a red flag because executing scripts, especially ones named after keylogging or similar activities, can be signs of malicious behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. While this is normal during script execution, the combination with the suspicious scripts adds to the concern. The multiple ProcessAccess tasks on powershell.exe suggest it's being accessed by other processes or perhaps interacting with itself in a way that could be obfuscating its activities.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated registry changes by chrome.exe (though not inherently bad), legitimate use of whoami.exe, and several suspicious PowerShell activities including executing potentially malicious scripts. The fact that the same script paths are referenced in different events suggests coordinated behavior, possibly indicating a campaign or an ongoing attack.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because while some actions aren't outright malicious on their own, the combination—especially the PowerShell activities—points towards potential malicious intent. The repeated use of scripts named for keystroke logging is particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), registry modifications, and file accesses indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that reference different paths ending in Get-Keystrokes.ps1. These scripts are designed to log keystrokes, which is a common indicator of malicious activity because such scripts can capture sensitive information like passwords.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the TEMP directory named key.log. This suggests data is being written, potentially to store stolen information.\n\nLooking further, I see that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and creating temporary files. The creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 file might indicate an attempt to bypass script execution policies by testing them first before executing the main payload.\n\nThere are also events where conhost.exe and svchost.exe are involved, which could be signs of process injection or running malicious scripts under different names. Additionally, one event shows a remote command being executed, which is another red flag as attackers often use such techniques to maintain persistence or spread malware.\n\nThe presence of multiple Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts across various paths suggests a pattern of activity that's likely part of an attack campaign. The repeated attempts and the nature of the commands make it clear that this batch of events isn't just isolated incidents but part of a coordinated effort, possibly aimed at compromising user data.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I'm confident that this batch shows malicious behavior that requires investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines referencing keystroke logging scripts, creation and deletion of temporary files associated with such activities, and evidence of script execution policy testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs. I'm looking at three separate events here, each involving file creation activities on a Windows system.\n\nFirst, the processes involved are svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and powershell.exe. Svchost is known as a legitimate process used by various services in Windows, so it's not inherently suspicious unless it's doing something out of the ordinary. Winlogbeat.exe is associated with the Elastic Stack, particularly Filebeat or Logstash, which are tools for log management, so that's also usually benign.\n\nThe third process is powershell.exe. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, making it a point of interest when anomalies are detected. Since one of the events involves this process creating a file, I need to pay closer attention.\n\nLooking at the files created:\n1. The first event creates 'keyValueLKG.dat' in a specific network service directory. That's an unusual name and path for such a file. Malware often uses encrypted or obfuscated filenames to hide their tracks.\n2. The second event is creating '.winlogbeat.yml.new' which seems related to the configuration of winlogbeat, so that might be normal if someone is setting up log management tools.\n3. The third event creates 'entrada_padrao.txt', a name that translates to something like 'default entrance'. It's an arbitrary name and could be anything.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe writing to the network service directory with an odd filename, powershell creating a file with a suspicious name, and winlogbeat creating its own file. While two of these could be normal, the combination—especially involving svchost.exe and powershell.exe—raises flags. It's possible that malicious activities are being masked under legitimate processes, or perhaps it's just coincidental.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the potential for malicious behavior, particularly with how svchost.exe is handling the file creation and the use of powershell.exe in an unusual context. The confidence isn't super high (maybe around 0.6) because there's no clear indication of immediate malicious intent, but the combination is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file creation events involving processes like svchost.exe and powershell.exe creating files with unusual names in unexpected locations.
