{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I see that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Powershell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities, but it's also common for legitimate use.\n\nLooking deeper, some of the events show that powershell.exe accessed registry values and created files in temporary directories. Creating a file like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1 might be part of script testing, which could be malicious if it's trying to bypass policy checks. Also, deleting that same file shortly after is interesting—maybe an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of New-PSDrive in the command line, which can map network drives. This could indicate lateral movement within a network, a common tactic in attacks. The multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could suggest the script is loading malicious modules.\n\nThe whoami.exe processes are less concerning on their own, as they're typically used to check user information. However, when paired with powershell's actions, it adds context that could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nConsidering all these together, there are several indicators that point towards potential malicious activity. The combination of file creation\/deletion, registry access, and network drive mapping using powershell suggests a possible attack. While some activities might be benign, the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including file creation, deletion, registry access, and network drive mapping suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each with process info, winlog task, and file details.\n\nLooking through the events, I notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times. That's common because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Each time it's accessed or created, it could be either normal admin work or something more nefarious.\n\nThe other thing I spot is several ImageLoad events from different DLLs. These are typical when an application starts up and loads necessary libraries. Not suspicious on their own, but combined with the PowerShell activity, they might indicate some scripting or module loading.\n\nThere's a file creation event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1 in the Temp directory. That's unusual because script files created temporarily could be part of testing policies, but it's also a red flag since attackers might create and delete scripts quickly to avoid detection. Then there's a FileDeleteDetected event for that same file, which makes me think someone is trying to remove evidence.\n\nThe command line in one of the events shows \"& {}\" for powershell.exe, which could be an attempt to obfuscate or execute commands without saving them as a script, making it harder to trace.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple PowerShell instances, creation and deletion of a script file, unusual command lines—it seems like there's potential malicious activity. The pattern fits with common attack techniques, so I should flag this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and created, along with file creation\/deletion activities in temporary directories, indicate potential malicious behavior or script execution.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few entries are about processes being created for PowerShell and whoami.exe. Not too unusual since these can be legitimate scripts or commands. Then there's a lot of registry activity from powershell.exe—setting values in the registry. That could be concerning because attackers often modify system configurations to maintain access.\n\nLooking further, I notice multiple ImageLoad events from various DLLs, includingclrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. These are standard for PowerShell scripts running .NET code, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries. The fact that these loads happen within powershell.exe is a red flag.\n\nThere's also a file creation of a temporary script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1) which was later deleted. Creating and immediately deleting files can be an attempt to avoid detection, common in malware. Additionally, there's a pipe created, which could allow communication between processes—a tactic used by malicious actors for command and control.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent entries indicate persistent changes, possibly to enable persistence or elevate privileges. Combined with the script execution and file deletions, this batch shows behavior that's hard to justify as normal user activity. It seems like someone is attempting to execute a PowerShell script that makes significant system changes, which is often part of an attack.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as INTERESTING due to these indicators, with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple Registry modifications and file operations indicative of potential malicious activity, including script execution and file deletions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems pretty normal because whoami is a standard system tool used to identify user information. It doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nNext, there's PowerShell being accessed. That catches my attention a bit because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and also has a history of being abused by attackers. So I'll keep that in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThen, svchost.exe creates a file. Svchost is another common process name often used by legitimate services like Windows services. However, it's also sometimes used by malware to hide their activities. The file path here looks a bit long and specific, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple events of PowerShell being accessed and creating files. This repetition makes me think there might be some automated process or script running. Since the user name \"fiddelis\" is mentioned in some file paths, maybe this is a routine admin task, but it's still something to watch because scripts can sometimes have unintended consequences.\n\nThere are several Image Load events from PowerShell. These are normal as part of how PowerShell loads its modules and components. But again, given that attackers might use these features, it's worth noting.\n\nThe creation and then deletion of a file in the Temp directory by PowerShell is interesting. Creating temporary files can be part of legitimate operations, but deleting them shortly after could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity. The fact that the script policy test was run (__PSScriptPolicyTest...) suggests some form of scripting, which could be for testing policies or potentially trying to bypass them.\n\nPutting this all together: there are multiple instances of PowerShell being used, file creation and deletion, and a script being tested. While each event on its own might not be alarming, the combination—especially the repeated use of PowerShell and the creation\/deletion pattern—could indicate suspicious activity. This could be an attempt to execute commands without leaving too much trace or testing for something malicious.\n\nI'm also considering that sometimes attackers use legitimate tools in a way that's not malicious, so it's tricky to determine intent. However, the frequency and specific actions taken (like creating files and then deleting them) are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion and script execution suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few entries are from powershell.exe. It starts with an image load and then creates a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That seems normal, but I know that sometimes attackers use PowerShell for command execution and persistence.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where PowerShell accesses processes. This could be part of legitimate scripting or it might indicate some process manipulation. Then there's whoami.exe being run twice; that's a common tool to check user permissions, so nothing suspicious on the surface.\n\nBut then I see cmd.exe with a command line \"\/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". Oh, that's turning off Windows Defender Firewall. That's a red flag because disabling the firewall is often part of malicious activity to lower system defenses.\n\nFollowing that, there's a netsh.exe command also trying to disable the firewall. This reinforces the idea that someone is attempting to shut down the firewall, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe is involved in several registry events: value sets and object additions\/deletions. Svchost.exe is commonly used by malware because it's a legitimate Windows process. Malware often uses it to hide their activities, so these registry changes might indicate malicious behavior like creating persistent backdoors or altering system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of disabling the firewall using both cmd and netsh, along with svchost.exe making multiple registry changes, suggests that there's potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell is also concerning as it's a common tool for attackers. The high number of registry events from svchost.exe adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm confident enough to say this batch is interesting because it shows signs of possible unauthorized system modifications aimed at compromising security.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of potentially malicious activities, including disabling Windows Defender Firewall and suspicious registry operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. All the events are in JSONL format, each with a process named \"svchost.exe\", a Windows log task indicating that a registry object was added or deleted, and no file information.\n\nFirst off, I know that svchost.exe is a common Windows process used by various services. Sometimes it's legitimate, but it can also be abused by malware. The fact that each event shows activity related to the Registry makes me think about what that could mean. Malware often manipulates the registry for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nLooking at these events, there are 25 entries all showing similar behavior: svchost.exe modifying the registry. Now, I should consider whether this is normal or not. Legitimate processes do use the registry, but repetitive modifications by the same process might be suspicious. Especially if it's happening multiple times in a short period.\n\nI wonder about the timing of these events. If they're all from different times spread out, maybe it's part of some legitimate activity. But with 25 entries, that could indicate something more systematic or automated, which might be malicious.\n\nAlso, since there are no file-related events mentioned, it's hard to tell if files are being accessed or modified alongside the registry changes. This absence might mean that the focus is solely on registry manipulation, which can be a sign of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether svchost.exe is known for such behavior in legitimate contexts. I recall that svchost.exe usually hosts Windows services, and sometimes these services do interact with the registry. But if it's doing so repeatedly without any other indicators, like file writes or network activities, it might still be concerning.\n\nI should also think about how many events are typical for such activity. If this is part of a system update or configuration change, maybe one or two entries would make sense. Twenty-five seems excessive unless there's a legitimate reason, but I can't think of any at the moment.\n\nMoreover, the combination of all these events together suggests a pattern. It's not just one occurrence; it's a batch of identical registry changes by the same process. This could be an attempt to create or modify multiple registry keys, which might be setting up persistence points for malware.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because while svchost.exe can have legitimate uses, the volume and nature of these events raise red flags. However, without additional context like timestamps, user activity, or other logs, it's hard to be 100% certain. But given that all the entries are identical and numerous, it's more likely than not that this batch is worth investigating further.\n\nSo, overall, I think the batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level because of the repetitive registry modifications by svchost.exe without any associated file activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are in JSONL format, with each line containing a single JSON object. There are multiple events here, so I'll need to look at them collectively rather than individually.\n\nLooking at the first set of entries (lines 1-16), each event shows that 'svchost.exe' is involved, and the task is either adding\/deleting a registry object or setting a registry value. 'Svchost.exe' is a known system process that hosts various services, so it's not inherently suspicious on its own. However, repeated changes to the registry could indicate potential malicious activity, but without more context, this alone might not be enough.\n\nThen, from line 17 onwards, there are events involving 'powershell.exe'. The command line shows a PowerShell script that creates a new PSDrive mapped to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". This is concerning because it suggests an attempt to access another system over the network. Such activity could indicate remote access attempts, which might be part of lateral movement in a network, a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\nThe combination of these events makes me think: multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and then PowerShell commands trying to connect to other systems. This sequence could be part of an attack chain where the attacker first configures something (like enabling a service or creating persistence points via registry modifications) and then attempts to spread to other machines.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of these events. There are 16 similar svchost.exe events followed by several PowerShell commands. The repetition might indicate自动化 or script-driven behavior, which is often a hallmark of malicious activity rather than legitimate user actions.\n\nMoreover, while isolated registry changes can be benign (like installing software), the fact that they're followed by network access attempts raises the suspicion level. Attackers often use such techniques to move within a network after gaining initial access.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might not be alarming, together they present a pattern that could indicate malicious behavior. However, without more context (like timestamps or additional logs), there's some uncertainty about the exact nature of these activities. Still, the combination is notable enough to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and PowerShell commands attempting network access indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the majority of these events involve powershell.exe being executed multiple times. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement and executing malicious scripts. The command lines in most events are either empty or contain basic commands like checking if a file exists. However, one event stands out: it uses New-PSDrive to create a mapped drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This could indicate an attempt to access another system's C drive, which is suspicious.\n\nThe other events involve checking for the existence of procdump.exe in specific paths. Procdump is a legitimate tool used for debugging and process dumping, but its presence or absence might be part of a larger malicious script to ensure certain tools are available after execution. The fact that it's being checked multiple times suggests automated behavior.\n\nThe WinLog task alternates between 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle', which are common events during PowerShell operations. However, the combination with specific command lines makes this batch more concerning than typical PowerShell usage.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's a pattern of potentially malicious activities: mapping a drive to another system, checking for tools, and repeated attempts that might indicate persistence or lateral movement. This raises my confidence that the batch is indeed interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious commands, including mapping a remote drive (\\\\Target\\\\C$) and repeated checks for procdump.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I'm given a batch of two events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at each event individually: both have a process command line that runs PowerShell with a specific script. The script checks if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a certain directory and exits accordingly. The file field is None in both cases.\n\nNow, analyzing the combination of these events. Since both are identical, it might indicate repeated attempts to check for the presence of procdump.exe. This behavior could be part of reconnaissance or establishing persistence, which are red flags in cybersecurity. However, without additional context like multiple failed attempts or other suspicious activities, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nI should consider the possibility that this is a legitimate process, perhaps a script checking for necessary tools before executing something else. But the use of PowerShell and specific file checks often associated with malware makes it worth noting.\n\nGiven these points, the batch doesn't definitively show malicious activity but does raise an eyebrow. So, I'd classify it as \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate repeated attempts to check for the existence of a file (procdump.exe) using PowerShell.
