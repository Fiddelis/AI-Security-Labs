Powershell is often used in scripting and can be a red flag because it's commonly exploited in attacks. Also, multiple instances of 'Registry value set' tasks across different processes suggest some kind of automated activity.\n\nThen, I see 'cmd.exe' being used with a command line that deletes notepad.exe processes. That's unusual because cmd isn't typically used for such actions unless someone is trying to cover their tracks or automate something malicious. The use of wmic to delete processes adds another layer; wmic is often associated with remote attacks and can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThere are also instances where Calculator.exe and WMIC.exe load system32 DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. While these DLLs are legitimate, their loading by such processes might indicate some form of tampering or attempts to bypass anti-malware measures (like AMSI).\n\nFurthermore, the process 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's directory could be suspicious if it's unexpected, possibly indicating log tampering. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks across various processes reinforce the idea that something might be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags: multiple process creations, registry modifications by different executables, deletion commands via cmd and wmic, and DLL loadings.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is WMIC.exe loading a DLL file. That could be suspicious because WMIC is often used for remote commands, so maybe it's trying to do something malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of processes like Notepad.exe, cmd.exe, Chrome.exe, and conhost.exe setting registry values. While these are common applications, the repeated Registry value sets might indicate some automated process or script altering system settings, which could be part of an attack.\n\nI notice a lot of PowerShell.exe entries accessing processes. This is concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The access to other processes might be part of lateral movement in a network.\n\nThere are commands executed via cmd.exe like copying files and deleting scheduled tasks. Specifically, the command \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\" stands out. This is trying to delete a task named win32times, which could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or disrupt system operations.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe being used similarly, which adds another layer to the potential malicious activity, as attackers often use scheduled tasks for persistence.\n\nI also see repeated process creations and accesses. This pattern might indicate someone trying to establish persistence or escalate privileges within the system.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to show a coordinated effort involving multiple processes and scripts possibly setting up backdoors, deleting security tools, or evading detection.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first line has schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. Schtasks is typically used for scheduling tasks, and taskschd.dll is a legitimate Windows file. No red flags there.\n\nNext up is svchost.exe with a registry change. SvcHost is a common process that can be associated with various services, so some registry activity isn't unusual. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe setting a registry value. I know cmd is often used for legitimate tasks and also by attackers because it's a standard tool. But just seeing it access the registry isn't enough to raise an alarm unless it's doing something malicious.\n\nConhost.exe also sets a registry value. Conhost is usually related to console windows, so this might be part of normal operations or maybe some script execution. Not alarming on its own.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with different log entries: ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. However, it's also commonly used by admins for legitimate tasks. The fact that it's accessed and used to set registry values could be a red flag, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nWhoami.exe running with no command line details seems normal since it's typically used to get user information.\n\nI notice cmd.exe being run with \"\/c\" in some events. That usually means it's executing a command and then terminating, which is common for scripts or batch files but could be part of malicious activity if the command is bad.\n\nChrome.exe shows up several times, both loading DLLs and making registry changes. The first one loads amsi.dll, which is related to anti-malware scanning, so that's normal. The other entries are about MpOAV.dll, which is also a legitimate file from Windows Defender. So no issues there.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple instances of cmd.exe and powershell.exe accessing registry values could indicate suspicious activity, especially if these commands are chaining together to execute malicious scripts or establish persistence. However, without seeing specific malicious commands or known bad file paths, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nI'm also considering that some events might be part of legitimate operations, like system updates or user scripts running. But the repeated use of powershell and cmd with registry interactions leans towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nSo, my classification would be INTERESTING because while there are legitimate uses, the combination of multiple instances accessing sensitive areas like the registry and using powerful tools like PowerShell could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe accessing registry values may indicate potential malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL logs, each containing process information and Windows log tasks.\n\nFirst event: whoami.exe is executed. That's usually benign because it's a common system command used to display user information. Not a red flag on its own.\n\nNext, multiple entries show powershell.exe being accessed, with various tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and so on. I know that PowerShell can be both legitimate for administration and potentially malicious because it's powerful. The fact that there are multiple instances where the same process is accessing different parts of the system—like registry modifications and file operations—might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking closer, powershell.exe creates a temporary script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1) and then deletes it shortly after. This behavior could be indicative of testing or attempting to bypass certain security policies. The creation and deletion of such files can sometimes be part of malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also several events where the command line for powershell.exe is \"& {}\". That seems a bit odd because typically, you'd expect a more specific command. This might indicate that the process is being used in a way that's not straightforward, possibly invoking other scripts or commands without clear parameters, which could be an evasion technique.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks for powershell.exe. These events relate to how PowerShell starts up and manages its environment. Repeated engine lifecycles might suggest that the process is being spun up and torn down frequently, possibly as part of a loop or automated routine.\n\nAnother point is the loading of several .NET framework DLLs by powershell.exe. While this isn't inherently suspicious, it's worth noting because attackers sometimes abuse legitimate processes to hide their activities. The fact that these are all related to PowerShell might contribute to the overall suspicion.\n\nThe final events involve winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file and another instance of powershell.exe opening a pipe. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so its activity here doesn't seem concerning on its own. However, when combined with the other suspicious PowerShell activities, it adds context but isn't directly indicative.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with non-standard command lines and temporary file operations could be a sign of malicious behavior, such as script testing, persistence mechanisms, or attempting to execute arbitrary code discreetly. While there's no smoking gun here, the combination of events suggests potential compromise or suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion of temporary scripts, and repeated process creations.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, a lot of these events are from powershell.exe. That's common because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities. The tasks include things like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Provider Lifecycle. \n\nLooking at the file paths, there's one where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal. But then there are multiple events where powershell.exe checks for specific .bat files in various directories using Test-Path. The command lines look like they're testing if certain scripts exist and exiting based on that.\n\nAlso, some events show conhost.exe accessing the registry, which is a bit unusual since it's typically used for console windows but could be part of malicious activities. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe creates new processes (Process Create), which might indicate script execution or lateral movement.\n\nThe repeated use of Test-Path in PowerShell commands makes me think they're checking for the presence of certain files to either execute them or perhaps ensure their absence, which is a common tactic in malware to clean up traces after execution. The paths referenced, like \"modulo_base_script.bat\" and others, don't seem to be standard Windows components, so it's suspicious.\n\nI also notice that some events have no file path associated, but they involve registry changes and process access, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated PowerShell activity with specific file checks, use of conhost.exe, and multiple process creations suggest possible malicious behavior. This could indicate an attack where scripts are being executed conditionally based on file presence, which is a common method for attackers to ensure their tools aren't detected or to stage further attacks.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of these events shows potentially malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file checks and process creations suggest potential malicious activity.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so anything involving it needs careful analysis. I notice several instances where files are being created and deleted, which could indicate script execution or file manipulation.\n\nLooking closer, there are multiple FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events from powershell.exe. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. That's suspicious because it might be part of a script checking if certain files exist before proceeding maliciously.\n\nAnother point is the creation of elemento_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. While not inherently malicious, creating new files could be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are ImageLoad events for various DLLs. Powershell loading these might be normal, but sometimes attackers use reflective DLL injection to hide their processes, so it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThere are also Registry value sets from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Browsers modifying the registry isn't unusual, but if these changes are part of a larger pattern, they could indicate persistence or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe command lines for powershell.exe show scripts testing paths like modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo and others. These paths don't seem to be standard system directories, which makes me think it's trying to check for specific files that might not exist, possibly as a way to avoid detection or execute malicious code conditionally.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated file creation\/deletion by powershell.exe, creation of non-standard files, and registry modifications. These behaviors could be indicators of script execution, potential malware activity, or attempts to establish persistence on the system. The combination suggests possible malicious intent, so this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe activities including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications suggest potential script execution or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each event has three main parts: process info, Windows log info, and file info.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that the process is \"powershell.exe\". That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware tends to use it for script execution and lateral movement.\n\nThe command lines in these events are creating new items (files) and setting content. For example, \"New-Item\" creates a file, and \"Set-Content\" writes to a file. The paths mentioned like \"..\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base...\" seem complex, indicating that files are being created in various directories, possibly trying to avoid detection or create persistence.\n\nThe Windows log tasks include things like \"Process Create\", which makes sense since PowerShell is starting up. There's also a lot of \"Registry value set\" and \"Image loaded\" events, which could indicate that the script is loading additional modules or interacting with system components, potentially for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're targeting locations like C:\\Windows and ProgramData, which are common targets for malware to establish persistence or modify system behavior. The fact that multiple files are being created in different directories suggests a pattern of activity that might be trying to spread across the system, possibly indicating an infection or payload deployment.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" task in later events. This could indicate that the script is interacting with Windows providers, which might be part of establishing persistence mechanisms or loading malicious drivers.\n\nPutting it all together, the consistent use of PowerShell to create and modify files across various directories raises suspicions. The activities described don't seem to be part of normal user behavior; instead, they appear more like what a script would do during an attack—creating scripts for execution, possibly setting up persistence mechanisms, or preparing for further malicious actions.\n\nI'm also considering whether these activities could be legitimate. While PowerShell is powerful and sometimes used by admins, the specific command lines and repeated file operations seem unusual for routine tasks. The paths don't follow standard conventions, which might indicate an attempt to hide or evade detection.\n\nSo, taking all this into account, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple red flags indicating potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating files and modifying registry values, possibly indicative of malicious script execution and persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's a PowerShell process with a command line that creates and sets some files in different paths. The task is 'Engine Lifecycle', which seems normal for PowerShell starting up.\n\nThe second event shows a file being created, but then the third event deletes it. This could be part of a script cleanup routine or something malicious trying to remove traces.\n\nThere are multiple events where PowerShell is creating files and registry entries. For example, creating batch files in various directories. Creating files with .bat extensions might indicate scripting activity—potentially for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nI notice that there are several instances of 'Registry value set' tasks. Modifying the registry can be a sign of persistent malware trying to maintain access or change system configurations.\n\nSome events involve 'Process Create' and 'Process Access', which could be part of process injection techniques, common in attacks likeDLL injections or spawning new processes for malicious activities.\n\nThe repeated creation of files named with 'script.bat' seems suspicious. It's possible that these scripts are being created to execute commands later on, maybe as part of a persistence mechanism or to execute additional payloads.\n\nThere's also an event where a script is tested via 'Test-Path', which suggests some conditional logic—maybe checking if certain files exist before proceeding with something else.\n\nThe events show multiple interactions with the file system and registry, which are common in both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, each representing some log entry from a system, likely related to PowerShell scripts and other processes. My task is to analyze all these events together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first six events are similar: they all involve `powershell.exe` being executed with a command line that checks if a specific batch script exists in certain directories. If it does, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. This kind of check is pretty common in scripts to ensure dependencies exist before proceeding.\n\n2. The seventh event shows PowerShell loading `MpOAV.dll`, which is part of Windows Defender. That's normal and not unusual since many processes load system DLLs.\n\n3. The eighth event creates a file in the Temp directory named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1`. This seems like it's related to PowerShell script policy testing, which could be part of configuration checks or security policies enforced by PowerShell.\n\n4. The ninth event deletes that same file, which makes sense after checking its existence, so nothing suspicious there yet.\n\n5. The tenth and eleventh events again involve `powershell.exe` with similar command lines as the first six but under different task categories (Engine Lifecycle instead of Provider Lifecycle). Again, these seem like part of normal script execution checks.\n\n6. The twelfth event is another image load by PowerShell, this time `MpClient.dll`, which is also a legitimate Windows Defender component.\n\n7. The thirteenth event involves `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting Windows logs, so this is expected behavior as it sets up its configuration files.\n\n8. The fourteenth and fifteenth events show PowerShell accessing a file in the StartupProfileData directory and making a registry change. These are standard operations when starting or using PowerShell, especially related to user profiles and configurations.\n\nNow, looking at all these together, most of them involve normal operations of `powershell.exe` performing checks on files, loading legitimate system DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files as part of its script policy testing, and other routine actions like registry modifications. The use of multiple batch paths in the command lines could be part of a script ensuring various components are present across different directories, which is common in setup or deployment scripts.\n\nI don't see any overt signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file accesses, no network connections, no known indicators of compromise (IoCs), and all activities are within the bounds of what PowerShell does during normal operations. The repeated checks on batch files might seem suspicious at first glance, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively. However, given that these are all standard operations and there's no evidence of anything beyond that, I would classify this batch as not particularly interesting for further investigation.\n\nConfidence-wise, since none of the events raise red flags and they all fit within normal system behavior, my confidence is high that this isn't malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis concludes that the log entries do not indicate suspicious or malicious activity. The actions are typical of PowerShell operations, including file checks, loading legitimate DLLs, temporary file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and configuration tasks. These activities are within normal system behavior, with no evidence of security threats.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nClassification: **Not Interesting (Benign)**\n\nConfidence Level: High (95%)  \n\nJustification:\n- The events involve routine PowerShell operations such as file checks, loading system DLLs, temporary file management, and configuration tasks.\n- No unusual or malicious patterns are present, like unexpected file accesses or network connections.\n- Activities align with standard behavior for script execution and system tools like Winlogbeat."}

Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is a process named \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's usually a benign command used to display user information, but sometimes it can be part of malicious activities if executed from unexpected places or in combination with other actions.\n\nNext up are several events related to powershell.exe. I notice that some have task 'Process accessed' and others 'Provider Lifecycle'. The command lines look like they're checking for the existence of certain files using Test-Path. That's a bit unusual because why would multiple checks be happening? It might indicate someone is probing the system, perhaps trying to see if specific binaries exist before executing them.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations, which raises some red flags. It's worth keeping an eye on what exactly is being changed, but with limited info here, I'm cautious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Image Load tasks for various DLLs related to .NET and the CLR. This is normal when running PowerShell scripts since they rely on these libraries. However, the number of such events might be a bit high; maybe the script is loading multiple modules or the environment is being set up extensively.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows repeated attempts to check for file existence in different directories and some registry activity. These behaviors could indicate someone trying to establish persistence or deploying malware components. The use of powershell.exe, which is often used in attacks due to its scripting capabilities, adds more concern. While each individual event might not be malicious on its own, the combination suggests potential malicious intent.\n\nI'm also thinking about possible scenarios where a legitimate script might perform such checks and registry modifications, but given the volume and specific paths referenced (like \"modulo_ativo\", \"registro_temporario\"), it feels more like an attacker trying to set up something persistent or verify the presence of tools on the system.\n\nSo overall, while there's no definitive proof of malicious activity, the pattern is concerning enough to warrant closer investigation. My confidence level isn't 100%, but it's high enough that I'd mark this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are accessing files and registry, possibly indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

I'm looking at a batch of system logs that all seem to involve PowerShell and other processes. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. There are multiple events where powershell.exe is involved, including actions like Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, and various Registry and Process accesses. Some of these events have command lines that check for the existence of certain files or executables.\n\nI notice that some command lines in PowerShell scripts are testing if specific files exist. For example:\n- `Test-Path \"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\registro_temporario\\\\registro_secundario\\\\bin\\\\componente_secundario.exe\"`\n- `Test-Path \"C:\\\\objeto_auxiliar\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\componente_principal\\\\bin\\\\entrada_auxiliar.exe\"`\n\nThese look like they're checking for the presence of files in specific directories. If the file exists, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. This kind of behavior could be part of a legitimate process to check if certain components are installed or available.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where whoami.exe and cmd.exe are executed. These are common tools used for various purposes, including checking user information or running commands in the command prompt. The cmd.exe command I see is using `\/c` which runs the command and then exits, similar to the PowerShell scripts.\n\nLooking at the files being accessed or created, like `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`, these are related to Microsoft Defender, so that's normal system behavior. The temporary files in the user's AppData folder also seem routine for script execution.\n\nThe registry accesses and value sets could be part of legitimate operations, such as configuration changes by scripts or applications running during their execution.\n\nI'm trying to see if there's any pattern indicating malicious activity. Common indicators might include repeated failed attempts to access restricted resources, unusual file creation in unexpected locations, or the use of tools typically associated with attacks (like certain PowerShell commands). However, in this case, the activities seem consistent with scripts checking for file existence and performing routine operations.\n\nAlso, the fact that these events are spread out across multiple processes but don't show signs of escalation or failure indicates it's more likely benign. There's no evidence of known malicious scripts or unusual process trees.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch doesn't exhibit clear signs of malicious behavior.

This repeated use of PowerShell could be suspicious because attackers often use it for malicious activities like script execution or lateral movement.\n\nThe events show several instances where the same command is run, which might indicate a script being executed multiple times or perhaps part of some automated process. The file paths in the Test-Path commands are varied but follow similar naming conventions, suggesting they might be part of a structured directory setup that an attacker could use to check for certain files as part of their payload.\n\nAdditionally, the events with \"Registry value set\" and image loading tasks indicate that PowerShell is accessing system resources, which is another red flag. Such activities can be indicative of malicious behavior, especially when combined with repeated process creations.\n\nThere's also a mention of mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components being loaded by powershell.exe.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events are related to PowerShell.exe processes. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate scripting and for executing malicious commands. Malware often uses PowerShell to avoid detection since it's common and can execute code directly in memory.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged: Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, Engine Lifecycle, Process Create, Registry value set, and Process accessed. These events are typical when a process is starting up or interacting with files, but I need to see if there's anything unusual about them.\n\nOne event stands out where the file path includes \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". That script name suggests it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic for keyloggers used in malware. If an attacker is using such a script, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of Test-Path commands in the command lines of PowerShell.exe processes. These are checking if specific files exist. This behavior might be part of a larger payload to ensure certain files are present before executing further actions. It's a common technique used by malware to check for indicators or to ensure its persistence mechanisms are in place.\n\nI also see multiple entries where files are being created and then deleted, which could be an attempt to clean up evidence after malicious activity. For example, the file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\" is created and then deleted. This kind of pattern can help avoid detection by log analysis tools.\n\nThe events involving registry value sets and process accesses could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or interact with other processes. These actions are often part of establishing persistence or privilege escalation, which are signs of potential malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of PowerShell usage, file creation\/deletion patterns, key scripting names, and repeated checks for specific files creates a concerning pattern. While not all individual events are necessarily malicious on their own, the batch as a whole shows behaviors that align with common attack vectors and indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe processes creating, deleting, and accessing files, including a script named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', which suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the majority of these events involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate scripting tasks and for malicious activities, so its presence in logs always warrants attention.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see several instances where powershell.exe is being executed with inline scripts or if statements checking for specific script files. For example:\n- The first event has a command line checking if \"C:\\\\registro_base\\\\entrada_base\\\\objeto_principal\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" exists.\n- Another event checks for \"C:\\\\unidade_temporario\\\\registro_temporario\\\\elemento_secundario\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\".\n\nThe pattern here is that the script is attempting to exit with 0 if the file exists, else it exits with 1. This kind of behavior could be part of a script verification process, ensuring that certain malicious scripts are present before proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe creates and then deletes a temporary file:\n- A file is created at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\".\n- Then, the same file is deleted shortly after.\n\nThis activity is reminiscent of how some malware operates: creating temporary files to execute scripts and then deleting them to avoid detection. The fact that this happens multiple times with different paths suggests a possible attempt to evade standard detection mechanisms by checking for the presence of certain files across various locations before proceeding with malicious activities.\n\nMoreover, there are several ImageLoad events related to .NET framework components and Windows Defender DLLs. While these might seem benign, in the context of powershell.exe processes, they could be part of obfuscation techniques or attempts to load necessary libraries for executing malicious code.\n\nThe use of multiple paths like \"C:\\\\registro_base\", \"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario\", \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\" suggests that the attacker is trying different locations to check for the presence of a script, possibly indicating an attempt to locate and execute it from various directories. This behavior could be part of a larger attack where the script is attempting to establish persistence or spread across the system.\n\nThe final event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which seems unrelated but might indicate that this process was monitoring the logs as they were being generated, potentially for exfiltration or log tampering purposes.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the combination of multiple powershell.exe processes checking for specific scripts across various directories, creating and deleting temporary files, loading numerous DLLs, and possibly involving log monitoring tools raises concerns about potential malicious activity. This batch of logs indicates behavior that could be indicative of a script attempting to verify its presence or execute malicious code, making it worthy of further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes check for specific scripts across different paths.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe doing various tasks like creating files and accessing processes. Powershell is often used in scripting but can also be a vector for malicious activities. However, seeing it create a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path might indicate persistence mechanisms or data collection.\n\nNext, whoami.exe being executed could be part of reconnaissance to gather system information. If this is run without any output redirection or unusual command-line arguments, it might not be suspicious on its own but in combination with other actions, it's worth noting.\n\nThere are also several instances where svchost.exe is modifying registry values and making network connections. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often exploited by malware to hide malicious activities. The repeated network connections could indicate communication with external servers, which might be part of command-and-control (C2) activity.\n\nAdditionally, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems unusual. While some legitimate processes load system DLLs, the combination here with other suspicious activities like svchost's network traffic raises flags.\n\nThe extensive number of NetworkConnect events from chrome.exe and svchost.exe could be an attempt to establish multiple connections, possibly for data exfiltration or communication with multiple C2 servers.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe activity, whoami.exe execution, suspicious file creation, registry modifications by svchost.exe, unusual DLL loading, and excessive network traffic. These collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, such as persistence, information gathering, and command-and-control communication.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, whoami.exe execution, suspicious file creation, registry modifications by svchost.exe, unusual DLL loading, and excessive network traffic.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a process named chrome.exe with a DNS query task. That seems normal because browsers do perform DNS lookups regularly, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed and then creating a new process. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access might be something to look into. But on its own, it's not enough.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe running without any command line arguments. That's usually harmless as it just outputs the current user, but again, it's better to keep an eye on it when combined with other events.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe is accessing and modifying registry values. This could be part of normal administration tasks or potentially setting up persistence mechanisms for malware. The fact that this happens multiple times is a red flag.\n\nI notice several Image Load events from PowerShell, which are common when scripts execute within the shell. However, the specific DLLs being loaded don't immediately raise any alarms unless they're known malicious ones.\n\nThere's a file created in the Temporary folder by PowerShell, named __PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. The fact that it's created and then deleted shortly after is concerning because it could be an attempt to test script execution policies or erase evidence of malicious activity.\n\nThe Pipe Created event from PowerShell might be for legitimate communication between processes, but in some cases, it can also be used by malware to create covert channels.\n\nMultiple Provider Lifecycle events linked to the same command line invoking PowerShell with a script that uses ls, get-childitem, and gci commands. These are typical directory listing commands, but when chained together like this, they might indicate an attempt to gather system information or possibly traverse directories recursively for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell with specific command lines, the creation and deletion of temporary files, registry modifications, and multiple events tied to the same script execution pattern suggest potential malicious activity. While each event individually could be benign, their combination points towards a possible attack vector, especially since the script might be attempting unauthorized access or persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts, including file creation and deletion in temporary directories, along with registry modifications. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments suggests possible exploitation for malicious purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see... There are multiple events here, each with process info, windows log details, and file info.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. The command lines in some of them look suspicious: \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\", which are cmdlets used to list items recursively. That's not inherently bad, but when combined with another command like \"gci -recurse\", it could indicate someone trying to enumerate files or directories.\n\nAlso, there are entries where the task in winlog is related to file creation or registry changes. For example, one process creates a file in the Downloads folder named 'estrutura_secundario.txt'. That filename seems out of place and might be an attempt to create a secondary structure or persistence mechanism. The path looks like it's from a user's downloads, which isn't unusual, but coupled with other PowerShell activity, it raises flags.\n\nAnother thing I see is the repeated use of 'powershell.exe' across multiple events. While legitimate scripts can use PowerShell, continuous activity without clear purpose might be malicious. Plus, some entries have tasks like 'Registry value set', which could be part of creating a persistence point or altering system configurations to allow unauthorized access.\n\nThere's also an entry where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in its data directory. That seems normal unless there's something else indicating tampering with logs, but I don't see that here directly.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands with recursive directory listings could be part of lateral movement or data gathering. The creation of specific files and registry changes might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or alter system settings maliciously. The frequency of these activities over the log entries suggests possible coordinated behavior, which is concerning.\n\nI'm a bit uncertain because some of these actions could be from legitimate scripts or tools. However, considering the combination of PowerShell usage, file creations in user directories, and registry modifications, it's more likely than not that this batch shows potentially malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands with potential enumeration and file creation activities, along with suspicious file paths and registry changes, suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
