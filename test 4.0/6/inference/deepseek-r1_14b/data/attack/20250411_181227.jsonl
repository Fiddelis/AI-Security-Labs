{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from powershell.exe processes. The command lines in some events show that PowerShell is creating scheduled tasks using Register-ScheduledTask. Specifically, these tasks execute calc.exe on startup. Using calc.exe isn't inherently malicious, but scheduling it with administrative privileges and at logon could be a red flag because attackers often use such methods for persistence.\n\nThe fact that multiple similar events are present—each registering a different task name like unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.—indicates possible automation or批量部署。这可能意味着攻击者正在设置多个启动任务，以便在系统启动时执行恶意代码。\n\nAdditionally, some events show registry value sets and process accesses related to powershell.exe. These activities are common in attacks as they can be used to maintain persistence or alter system configurations stealthily.\n\nThere's also an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and modifies the registry. While Chrome is a legitimate application, unexpected registry changes could indicate tampering or malicious activity, especially if other events point towards compromise.\n\nTaking all these into account—the use of PowerShell for creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, registry modifications, and image loads—this batch shows signs of potential malicious behavior. The repetition and combination of these actions increase the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with administrative privileges, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. First, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used for malicious activities. The fact that it's loading different files like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll might indicate some kind of script execution.\n\nThen there are events showing a file being created and immediately deleted by powershell.exe. This temporary file deletion could be an attempt to hide traces of malicious activity, which raises my suspicion level. The command line in one event shows scheduled task creation with calc.exe as the action. Scheduling tasks can be legitimate but in this context, it might be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry writes from chrome.exe. While Chrome does update the registry for extensions and settings, multiple such events without any other signs of anomaly might not be suspicious on their own. But combined with the PowerShell activities, it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe last few entries show \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks but no process or file involved. This could mean remote execution is happening, which is often malicious, especially if there's no legitimate reason for such commands in this context.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe with potentially suspicious activities, temporary file creation\/deletion, scheduled task setup, and remote command executions. These patterns suggest possible malicious behavior, making the batch definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe loading various files and creating\/ deleting temporary files, along with suspicious scheduled task creation and remote command execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. The user is asking me, as a cybersecurity expert, to analyze the entire batch and decide whether it's worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. Let's start from the top:\n\n1. There are multiple events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. These could be legitimate admin tasks or signs of remote access attacks. Since they're repeated so often, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\n2. Then there's an event involving powershell.exe creating a scheduled task. The command line shows some PowerShell code that creates a scheduled task called \"unidade_comum\". The action is to execute calc.exe at logon, with highest privileges. That seems odd because using calc.exe as the payload isn't common in real attacks but could be a test or a beacon.\n\n3. Next, WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll – that's normal since it's part of Windows Management Instrumentation.\n\n4. Multiple svchost.exe events setting registry values and creating files. SvcHost is a common process for services, but unusual activity here could be malicious.\n\n5. More 'Execute a Remote Command' events follow, which adds to the suspicion.\n\n6. There's another powershell.exe event creating a file in the StartupProfileData folder. This might be storing some configuration or scripts on startup, which can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\n7. Conhost.exe and chrome.exe also show registry writes, but I'm more cautious about conhost since it's often used by malicious scripts to interact with the console.\n\n8. Chrome loading various DLLs seems normal unless they're flagged as suspicious elsewhere.\n\n9. Winlogbeat creating a config file is probably unrelated unless there's something wrong with its operation.\n\n10. Lastly, another powershell.exe creating a file named 'entrada_principal.txt' in downloads. The name translates to \"main entrance\" or similar, which might be obfuscation.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple remote command executions, scheduled task creation using powershell, and files created by powershell scripts could indicate malicious activity. The repetition of certain tasks and the use of highest privileges for a simple calc.exe execution raises flags. These behaviors don't align with normal user activities and could be signs of an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nSo, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because it shows potential indicators of compromise, like remote command executions, scheduled task creations, and file writes by potentially malicious scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities, such as repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks and suspicious PowerShell operations creating scheduled tasks and files. These could be indicators of compromise or attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are eight events where the process is 'chrome.exe' with tasks indicating that a registry value was set. Registry changes can be normal for applications but could also be signs of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to hide traces.\n\nThen, I notice another event from 'winlogbeat.exe' which created a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this might just be it setting up its configuration file, which seems benign unless the path looks suspicious, but in this case, it doesn't stand out.\n\nThe next event is from 'powershell.exe', and it's also creating a file. PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities. Creating a new file could be part of malicious activities like downloading or writing files for later use. The filename here is 'objeto_auxiliar.txt', which doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with the other events, it might warrant closer investigation.\n\nPutting it all together, having multiple instances where Chrome is modifying registry settings and then seeing file creation from both winlogbeat and powershell could be concerning. While each event on its own isn't necessarily malicious, the combination—especially the repeated registry changes and PowerShell activity—could indicate potential suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, a powershell file creation, and possible log shipping activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or investigation-worthy events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
