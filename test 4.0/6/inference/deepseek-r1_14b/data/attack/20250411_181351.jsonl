{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. The command lines in some events show script blocks using Add-Type from System.Windows.Forms, which suggests they're trying to capture the screen. That sounds suspicious because screen capturing can be part of data exfiltration or surveillance.\n\nLooking at other processes, whoami.exe is there, but it's usually benign and just reports user information. However, seeing svchost.exe in one event with a Registry value set might be concerning since svchost is often associated with legitimate services but can sometimes be abused by malware.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe accesses the registry (RegistryEvent). Unusual registry activity can indicate malicious behavior, especially if it's setting or modifying values that could enable persistence or other malicious functions.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various .DLL files when running powershell.exe. While loading these libraries is normal in some contexts, the specific combination and frequency might be worth investigating. The paths mentioned seem legitimate, but combined with other behaviors, it raises concerns about potential exploit activities.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command lines that involve screen capture scripts stands out. This pattern could indicate an attempt to take screenshots, which is a technique often used by attackers for persistence or data theft.\n\nPutting all these together, the consistent and repetitive actions involving powershell.exe, especially with commands that don't seem necessary or are unusual in typical system operations, suggest potential malicious activity. The screen capture attempts are particularly worrying as they can be used for surveillance or exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with suspicious command lines that attempt to capture the screen, along with registry access and file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes running with command lines that involve capturing the screen and saving images to the TEMP directory. The command lines have similar structures, using Add-Type to load the System.Windows.Forms assembly and then taking screenshots which are saved as .png files in different locations under %TEMP%. This is a bit unusual because such actions could be part of a script trying to capture visual data from the system.\n\nLooking at the task names in winlog, several entries mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" and others like \"File created\", \"Pipe Created\", etc. The fact that multiple events are tied to PowerShell suggests they might be part of a script execution or automated process. The creation and deletion of a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1 in the user's TEMP folder is interesting—it could indicate a test script being run, perhaps checking permissions or system policies.\n\nThere are events where PowerShell creates and deletes this specific file, which might be part of a persistence mechanism. The repeated execution of these scripts and the associated file operations could be red flags for potential malicious activity. Additionally, some events mention \"Execute a Remote Command\" and \"Executing Pipeline,\" which might imply that commands are being run over the network or in a way that's not typical user activity.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple instances of PowerShell running similar script-based actions, file creation\/deletion in TEMP, and remote command execution tasks make me think this could be indicative of malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because while some events might look innocent on their own, the combination suggests a possible attack vector or unauthorized system access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes executing similar script-based actions capturing screen elements and saving images to TEMP directory. Also includes file creation\/deletion in TEMP and remote command execution tasks, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are several entries involving powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event shows a command line that runs a PowerShell script which captures the screen and saves it as an image in the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious—screen capturing could be part of a persistence mechanism or to gather information. So, this might indicate some sort of malicious activity.\n\nThen, there's a file creation by powershell.exe under the Windows PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here, but creating files in such directories can sometimes be part of script initialization, which could be either benign or part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry value sets from various processes like conhost.exe and others. Registry modifications are another red flag because attackers often use them to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nI also notice several events from chrome.exe accessing the registry and making DNS queries. While Chrome is a common application, frequent registry accesses might be out of the ordinary, especially if they're not tied to known legitimate activities. The DNS query could indicate communication with external servers, which might be malicious.\n\nThere are ImageLoad events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll from chrome.exe. These are legitimate system files used by Windows Defender and AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), so that's probably benign.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of PowerShell executing commands to capture the screen, creating files in user-specific directories, and multiple registry modifications across different processes could indicate malicious behavior. The high number of registry writes from chrome.exe is also concerning as it doesn't align with typical browser activity. While some activities might be legitimate, the combination here raises enough flags to warrant further investigation.\n\nI'm not entirely certain about all aspects—for example, whether the specific file creations and registry changes are part of a known malicious campaign—but based on the information given, there's sufficient evidence to classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities including PowerShell executing commands that capture the screen, creating files in non-standard locations, and multiple registry modifications. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
