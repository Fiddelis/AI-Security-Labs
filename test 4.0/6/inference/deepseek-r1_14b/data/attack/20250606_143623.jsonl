I see multiple entries where PowerShell is being used, especially with command lines that include creating a new service and starting it. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, there are several instances of 'Process Create' events for powershell.exe, which suggests it's being executed multiple times. The fact that one of the command lines is obfuscated with escaped characters (like \\\\\\\" and \\\\n) makes me think it's trying to hide its true purpose—maybe executing malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation and deletion events related to a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1). This pattern is common when attackers test if their actions are allowed or try to avoid detection by quickly deleting traces of their activity. The quick creation and deletion could indicate an attempt to bypass file persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe events also show that PowerShell loaded several DLLs, which isn't unusual, but combined with the other suspicious activities, it adds up. There's a sequence where services.exe is modifying the registry multiple times—this could be an attempt to create or modify system services, possibly for persistence or to gain elevated privileges.\n\nPutting it all together, these events display behavior that's indicative of potential malicious activity.

Services.exe is a common Windows process that handles services, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry frequently. I don't see any red flags here yet.\n\nNext, I notice multiple events from \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Each of these is an ImageLoad event, which means the process is loading other DLL files. The paths listed are all within standard Microsoft.NET Framework and Windows system directories, which seems legitimate. No suspicious file paths here—these look like normal .NET components.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell-related event where it creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory under the user's AppData folder. This could be concerning because attackers might use PowerShell for malicious activities. However, without additional context, this single FileCreate event isn't enough to raise an alarm on its own. It might just be part of normal script execution.\n\nAfter that, there are more Registry value sets from services.exe and svchost.exe. Svchost.exe is another common Windows process used by various services, so registry writes here aren't unusual either.\n\nThe last event is a file creation in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. This seems entirely normal as part of system updates or maintenance logging.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are standard system activities. The only potentially suspicious point is the PowerShell FileCreate event, but without more data on what's happening with PowerShell, I can't classify this batch as definitely malicious.

That seems like standard installation or update activities.\n\nI notice that some events involve file creations and image loading of taskschd.dll, which is related to Task Scheduler—another normal activity. The RuntimeBroker also makes registry changes, which isn't unusual either.\n\nThere's no indication of failed logins, access denials, or suspicious files. All the paths look legitimate.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. These are all common Windows processes, with svchost being a known process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware because it's part of the Service Host process for various services.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks in these events: there are several entries where the task is \"Registry value set\" or \"Registry object added or deleted\". Registry modifications can be tricky because they're common during normal system operations, like installing software or configuring settings. However, frequent registry changes without a clear purpose could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event where setup.exe creates a file at 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge_proxy.exe' and another for pwahelper.exe. Additionally, there are pipe creation events and the creation of shortcut files in various system directories like AppData and ProgramData. The creation of these files could be part of a legitimate installation process, but it's worth checking if Microsoft Edge is being updated or installed.\n\nI recall that sometimes malware uses registry modifications to persistence, so seeing multiple such entries might raise a flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. The fact that setup.exe is creating files and registry entries could be part of an update process for Microsoft Edge. It's also possible that these are just regular system updates or legitimate software installations.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency of these events. There are several entries from svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe all performing registry operations. This clustering around registry activity might warrant closer investigation because attackers often use the registry for persistence mechanisms.\n\nOn the other hand, if these activities align with known update cycles or legitimate processes, they might not be suspicious at all. But given that there's a mixture of registry modifications and file creations in system directories, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nSo, putting this together, I would classify this batch as INTERESTING because while some of these activities are normal, the combination of multiple registry changes across different processes and the creation of specific files could indicate potential malicious behavior. My confidence is moderate because there isn't enough concrete evidence yet, but the pattern does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe, along with file creations in system directories, may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from \"setup.exe\" performing Registry operations and creating pipes. Setup.exe is commonly used for software installations, so these activities might be normal during an update or installation. The repeated Registry writes could indicate that the application is configuring settings, which isn't unusual.\n\nThen, I notice \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" also doing a Registry write. Runtime Broker is part of Windows' User Account Control and is often involved in launching elevated processes, so it's not inherently suspicious unless it's doing something out of the ordinary. Here, it's just writing to the Registry, which fits its usual operations.\n\nNext, there are several entries from \"svchost.exe\" creating files in temporary directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp and also one in AppReadiness. Svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services. The creation of multiple temp files with varying names might be part of normal service operations, especially if it's dealing with updates or app readiness.\n\nThe file paths look like temporary files with random-looking filenames. This could be related to the installation or update process of some application. It's not uncommon for legitimate software installations to create and delete temporary files during setup.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual processes or actions that are typically associated with malicious activities, such as writes to unexpected locations, multiple failed attempts, or operations without proper permissions. All events seem consistent with normal system operations, specifically related to setup and updates.\n\nGiven all these observations, the batch doesn't raise any red flags. However, it's still somewhat concerning because the repetition of certain tasks might warrant closer monitoring. But on a scale from 0 to 1, I'd say the confidence is around 0.2. There's a slight chance that something could be off, but it's more likely just normal system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal system processes such as setup operations and file creation in temporary directories, which do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where 'svchost.exe' is creating files in the Windows AppReadiness directory. The paths look like they're related to user profiles or system initialization. I remember that svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, often used by services, so these file creations might be part of normal operations.\n\nNext, there are several instances where 'svchost.exe' is setting registry values. Again, since svchost.exe handles services and can interact with the registry, this doesn't immediately raise red flags unless the specific keys being modified are unusual. But without more context on what's being set, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's an entry for 'RuntimeBroker.exe' making a registry change. Runtime Broker is related to User Account Control (UAC) and app container management, so its activity in the registry isn't uncommon. I don't see any signs of malicious behavior here.\n\nThe next few events involve 'powershell.exe'. The first one shows it being executed with a command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which suggests it's being run in a more controlled environment—often seen in enterprise settings for compliance reasons. The command itself seems benign, just outputting text.\n\nFollowing that, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are typical .NET framework components that PowerShell would need to run scripts or execute commands. No anomalies here in terms of unexpected file paths or versions.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe's activities seem routine for system processes and services. The powershell.exe execution is straightforward with a simple command, no signs of malicious scripting or payload downloads. All the file and registry accesses are within expected bounds for these processes. There's no evidence of unusual network activity, dropped files, or other indicators that might suggest an attack.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't indicate any suspicious behavior. It looks like normal operational logs from system processes and PowerShell running legitimate tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal process activities such as file creations by svchost.exe, registry modifications, and legitimate PowerShell execution with a benign command.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful for scripting and can execute commands. The fact that it's being called several times might be a red flag, but I need to look deeper into what each event shows.\n\nLooking at the events, many of them are about images loaded, files created, and processes accessed. For example, one event shows powershell.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems suspicious because why would PowerShell need to load defender-related DLLs? Maybe it's trying to hide or mimic legitimate processes.\n\nAnother point is the creation of temporary files in C:\\Windows\\Temp with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_*. These look like they're part of script testing, which could be a way to bypass certain policies. The command line in one event shows that PowerShell is executing some code related to checking INF files for specific patterns. That might indicate an attempt to detect or interact with system components, which could be malicious.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe was executed. While it's a legitimate tool for checking user information, when combined with other powershell activities, it could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nThe repeated loading of various DLLs by PowerShell might be indicative of attempts to load malicious payloads or inject code into processes. The multiple file creations in temporary directories could be signs of script staging or creating persistence points.\n\nOverall, the pattern here is a series of actions that are commonly associated with post-exploitation activities. Attackers often use powershell for such tasks because it's built-in and can perform both legitimate and malicious operations under the radar. The combination of process creation, file handling, and DLL loading, especially in a batch like this, suggests potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm not seeing any direct evidence of exploit code or payload execution, but the activities are consistent with those an attacker might perform after gaining initial access. Therefore, these events merit closer investigation to rule out any malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes performing file operations and loading various DLLs, including attempts to create temporary files and execute commands that may indicate potential malicious activity or post-exploitation behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's Powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll. That seems normal because Windows Defender uses these files. But I should keep an eye out for any anomalies here, like unexpected commands.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process running a command with Dism. The command looks suspicious—it's trying to disable Windows Defender and remove it without restarting. Disabling Defender could be a red flag since it's a key security component. I wonder why someone would disable it; maybe they're trying to hide something or install malicious software that doesn't like being detected.\n\nThen, another Powershell.exe event but no file info. Not too concerning on its own, but combined with the cmd command, it might be part of a larger script.\n\nThe following events are all from Dism.exe. It's creating files and accessing various DLLs in a temporary directory. The paths look legitimate at first glance, as Dism is a known system imaging tool. But the fact that multiple files are being accessed and created in a temp folder could indicate something malicious unpacking or deploying components.\n\nThe repeated File Executable Detected events on these temporary files make me think that the system is flagging them as potential threats. If Dism.exe is executing these DLLs, it might be part of a payload delivery. The naming conventions like \"DismHost.exe\" and \"DismProv.dll\" seem crafted to blend in with legitimate processes.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe disabling Defender, Powershell activity, and Dism creating numerous temporary files that trigger file execution warnings. This sequence could be an attempt to remove defensive measures (like Windows Defender) and deploy malicious software using a known tool like Dism as a front. The consistent use of temp directories suggests a possible installation or payload drop.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because the combination of disabling antivirus, Powershell usage, and suspicious file creation points toward potential malicious activity. However, I need to ensure there's no benign reason for these actions, such as legitimate system maintenance. But considering the specific command used to disable Defender and the subsequent file activities, it seems more likely to be an attack vector.\n\nSo, the batch should be classified as INTERESTING with high confidence because of the potential attack indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show suspicious activity including disabling Windows Defender, Powershell executions, and multiple file creations by Dism.exe in temporary directories, which may indicate malicious intent.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always 'Dism.exe', which I recognize as the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool in Windows. It's used for servicing Windows images, like adding or removing features. So Dism.exe is a legitimate system process.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every event says the task is \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule name \"FileExecutableDetected\". This makes me think it's related to some kind of monitoring or antivirus software detecting an executable file. But since it's happening multiple times, maybe it's just part of normal operations.\n\nThe file paths are all under C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\<some GUID>\\en-US\\*. The files being detected are various .dll.mui files, like DismCore.dll.mui and others. I know that .mui files are usually resource files for Windows components, containing localized strings or other resources. These are legitimate parts of the operating system or its updates.\n\nSo each event is Dism.exe executing and triggering a detection of one of these MUI files. Since all the paths point to temporary directories under AppData, it's likely part of some update or servicing process where these resource files are being accessed or extracted temporarily.\n\nNow, considering that this happens 14 times in a row, each time with Dism.exe and a different MUI file. It seems consistent and not indicative of malicious activity. Malware usually doesn't use legitimate system tools like Dism.exe for such purposes, unless it's attempting to hide its activities. But the files being accessed here are standard parts of Windows updates or servicing packs.\n\nI don't see any red flags like unusual file paths, access to sensitive areas beyond the temp directory, or multiple different processes involved. All events point back to a single legitimate process and standard system files.\n\nTherefore, these events are probably just part of normal Windows operations during an update or servicing process. They don't seem suspicious or malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\n- **Process:** The process name 'Dism.exe' is legitimate, used for servicing Windows images.\n- **Event Task:** \"File Executable Detected\" indicates monitoring but isn't unusual in this context.\n- **Files Accessed:** All files are .mui resources, standard in Windows updates or servicing.\n- **Conclusion:** These events are part of normal system operations and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"interesting\": false,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The events are related to legitimate system processes involving Dism.exe accessing standard MUI files during servicing.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I see that each line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process key always shows 'Dism.exe', which I know is related to the Deployment Image Service Installer in Windows. It's used for servicing Windows images, like adding or removing features, drivers, etc. So, Dism.exe running normally isn't something malicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, each event has a task named 'File Executable Detected' with a rule called 'FileExecutableDetected'. This suggests that the system detected an executable file being accessed or created. These kinds of events are usually triggered when the OS identifies something that might be potentially dangerous but isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThe file paths all start with C:\\Users\\... and point to various .dll files in a temporary directory under '33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89'. The filenames like SmiProvider.dll.mui, SysprepProvider.dll.mui, etc., seem to be related to different providers or components within the OS. These are typical system files that might be part of updates, servicing packages, or configuration changes.\n\nSince all these events are generated by the same process (Dism.exe) accessing various DLLs in a temporary directory, it's likely that this is part of a legitimate Windows update or servicing operation. Dism is often involved when installing updates or performing system configurations because it handles the extraction and installation of package files.\n\nI should consider if there's any reason to think these events are suspicious. If Dism.exe were being run from an unexpected location or with unusual permissions, that might raise a red flag, but in this case, all file paths seem normal. The temporary directory is also standard for such operations since they often extract files into temp locations during servicing.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise like unusual process behavior, writes to unexpected directories, or associated network activity mentioned here. Each event simply notes that an executable was detected, which is expected when system processes are handling DLLs.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the same process (Dism.exe) accessing known system-related files in a temporary directory as part of file detection events. This looks like standard Windows servicing operations rather than malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is likely not suspicious.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries are coming from \"Dism.exe\" and later from \"DismHost.exe\". Dism is known as the Deployment Image Service Installer, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating systems. It's commonly used during setup or updates to install, remove, or update components on a Windows image.\n\nThe events show that Dism.exe is detecting several files with extensions like .dll in temporary directories. The file paths are all under the same temp folder: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\. These files include ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, and others. The fact that Dism.exe is processing these files as part of its normal operation suggests this is standard activity.\n\nThen there's an event where \"DismHost.exe\" is started with a specific command line parameter. This seems like it's the main host process for Dism, which would typically load various provider DLLs. The subsequent events show that several DLLs are being loaded by DismHost.exe from the same temporary directory.\n\nI recall that during normal Windows updates or servicing operations, temporary files are created in such directories, and legitimate processes like Dism and its associated tools will handle these files. There's nothing unusual about the file names or paths provided; they all seem to align with standard components used by Dism for deployment and servicing tasks.\n\nAlso, the events don't show any signs of unexpected behavior, such as multiple failed attempts, access from unknown sources, or deviations from typical patterns. Everything follows a logical sequence expected during a servicing operation.\n\nIn conclusion, these logs represent normal operations performed by legitimate Windows tools during an update or servicing process. There's no indication of malicious activity or anything outside the expected behavior for Dism and its components.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Names:** The events are generated by \"Dism.exe\" and \"DismHost.exe,\" both legitimate Windows tools used for deployment and servicing.\n\n2. **Understand Temporary Paths:** All files are located in a temporary directory, which is standard for such operations to avoid affecting the system until completion.\n\n3. **Recognize DLLs Loaded:** The .dll files listed are known providers used by Dism during servicing tasks, indicating normal operation.\n\n4. **Analyze Event Sequence:** The sequence starts with Dism.exe processing files and then launches DismHost.exe, which loads necessary components—typical for a servicing process.\n\n5. **Check for Red Flags:** No signs of anomalies like unauthorized access or unexpected failures are present in the logs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe log entries represent standard activity by legitimate Windows tools during a servicing operation.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most are from 'DismHost.exe' and relate to image loading tasks. These seem normal because DismHost is part of the Windows deployment tools and typically handles such operations during setup or updates.\n\nThen, there's an event where 'DismHost.exe' terminates its process, which isn't unusual since processes often end after completing their tasks.\n\nAfter that, I see several events from 'Dism.exe' logging file deletions. The files being deleted are all DLLs located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. These include various providers like 'AppxProvider.dll', 'AssocProvider.dll', etc. Since Dism is related to servicing and deployment, it makes sense that it would clean up these temporary files after use.\n\nThe paths of the deleted files are all within a single temp directory, which suggests they were created together for a specific operation, such as an update or setup process. The fact that multiple DLLs from the same temp folder are being deleted indicates this is part of a routine cleanup rather than malicious activity.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious behavior across these events.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at what each event shows.\n\nAll the events are from a process named \"Dism.exe\". That stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, which is used in Windows for servicing operating system images. It's usually legitimate software used by sysadmins or IT pros for managing OS images, so that's not inherently bad.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most of these events are related to file deletions (File Delete logged) and one mentions a change in file creation time. The files being deleted are all under a temporary directory path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ followed by various GUID-like identifiers, and then different DLLs like DismCore.dll, DismHost.exe, etc.\n\nNow, the paths look pretty standard for temp files created during some operation. The fact that Dism.exe is deleting these files might just be part of its normal cleanup process after performing an image servicing task. It's not unusual for such tools to create temporary files and delete them once done.\n\nI should consider if there's anything suspicious about the number of deletions or the specific files being deleted. There are multiple events showing deletions of various .dll files, some in English language resource directories (en-US). Since Dism.exe works with system components, deleting these could be part of its operation, especially during updates or servicing.\n\nThe only non-delete event is one where the file creation time changed. That's a bit more concerning because changing timestamps can sometimes indicate tampering, but again, it might just be part of the normal process for Dism.exe managing files.\n\nI also need to think about whether these actions happening in sequence are unusual. If Dism.exe is performing multiple operations as part of a legitimate task, then seeing several file deletions and one timestamp change could be normal.\n\nLooking at the confidence level: I'm pretty confident that this isn't malicious because Dism.exe is a known legitimate tool, and its behavior here aligns with expected actions during servicing. However, if these events happened outside of an expected update or deployment context, it might raise more flags. But based on the given information, there's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The batch doesn't seem to indicate any suspicious activity beyond what would be expected from a legitimate tool performing its tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer**\n\n1. **Identify Process**: The events involve \"Dism.exe,\" a legitimate Windows system tool used for servicing OS images.\n\n2. **Analyze Event Types**: Most events are file deletions, with one indicating a change in file creation time. These actions are typical during cleanup after servicing operations.\n\n3. **Examine File Paths**: Temporary files under a standard path suggest normal operation rather than malicious activity.\n\n4. **Assess Frequency and Nature**: Multiple deletions of various DLLs and resource files align with Dism.exe's known behavior, supporting the conclusion that these actions are legitimate.\n\n5. **Consider Context**: Without additional context indicating unauthorized use, the events appear non-suspicious.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch is not considered suspicious. The activities described are consistent with the normal operations of \"Dism.exe\" in managing and servicing operating system images, including creating and deleting temporary files.

I see that each event is logged in JSONL format, so there are 14 separate entries here.\n\nEach entry has three main parts: process information indicating it's Dism.exe, a Windows log task about a file deletion, and the specific file path being deleted.\n\nFirst off, Dism.exe is known as the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. It's used for servicing Windows images and can be involved in tasks like installing updates or creating recovery images. So, when I see it executing, especially deleting files, it might not always be malicious, but it's something to look into.\n\nLooking at the file paths being deleted: all of them are within a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a long GUID-like folder name. The files being deleted have names like IBSProvider.dll.mui and others, which seem to be resource files for various Windows components. These are likely language-specific files (the en-US part) that might not be needed after an installation or servicing operation.\n\nThe repeated nature of the events—each one deleting a different .dll.mui file from the same temporary directory—suggests this is part of a normal process. Dism.exe often creates temp directories during its operations and cleans them up afterward. So, in this case, it's possible that these deletions are part of a legitimate update or servicing operation.\n\nHowever, there are a few red flags to consider:\n\n1. The number of events: Deleting 14 different files might be excessive unless it's part of a bulk operation.\n2. The process is running as fiddelis, which is the user account name. If this isn't an expected activity from that user, especially if they're not administering the system or deploying updates, it could raise suspicion.\n\nBut on the other hand:\n\n- Dism.exe is a standard Windows tool and having it run during updates or servicing is normal.\n- The files being deleted are known resource DLLs, which are commonly part of system operations.\n\nI should also consider whether these events were logged over a short period. If they all happened within a few seconds or minutes, that might be more concerning than if spread out. However, without the timestamp information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle is checking if there have been any recent system updates or installations that would trigger Dism.exe. If so, these deletions could very well be part of that process. Conversely, if no such update was installed and this activity occurred unexpectedly, it might indicate unauthorized access or malicious software using legitimate tools for its operations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the events themselves don't definitively prove anything, they warrant closer examination in context. Monitoring for additional suspicious activities and correlating with system updates could help determine if this is normal behavior or a potential threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of 14 JSONL events indicates repeated file deletions by `Dism.exe` within a temporary directory. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- **Process**: Each event shows `Dism.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility for servicing images.\n- **Files Deleted**: All files are `.dll.mui` resources from various components, located in a temporary folder under the user profile.\n- **User Account**: The activity is attributed to the `fiddelis` user.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Legitimate Use**: `Dism.exe` often deletes temporary files during servicing operations like updates or image deployments. If this occurred post-update or servicing, it's normal.\n2. **Excessive Deletions**: Deleting 14 files might seem excessive, but it could be part of a bulk cleanup operation after a significant servicing task.\n3. **User Context**: If `fiddelis` is an account performing administrative tasks, this activity would be expected. Otherwise, it's unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the events don't confirm malicious intent on their own, they should be monitored in context. Check if they align with known system updates or servicing operations. If not, investigate for potential unauthorized access or misuse of `Dism.exe`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"indicator\": {\n    \"name\": \"Dism.exe\",\n    \"description\": \"Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool used for servicing Windows images.\",\n    \"reputation\": \"Generally legitimate but can be misused.\"\n  },\n  \"activity\": {\n    \"count\": 14,\n    \"temp_directory\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE982-...\\\\en-US\",\n    \"files_deleted\": [\"IBSProvider.dll.mui\", \"...\"],\n    \"user\": \"fiddelis\"\n  },\n  \"risk_assessment\": {\n    \"score\": \"medium\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Potentially legitimate but requires context to confirm.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events that were provided. Each event is a JSON object with three main keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, the process key consistently shows 'Dism.exe'. I know that Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services, used for tasks like image deployment and updates. It's a legitimate Microsoft tool, so seeing it as the process name doesn't immediately raise red flags unless it's doing something unusual or outside its normal operations.\n\nThe winlog key across all events mentions 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. This indicates that each event is logging a file deletion and that there's a specific rule in place to detect such deletions. The fact that this task is logged suggests it's being monitored, which might imply some level of concern if these deletions are unexpected.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them point to files within 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89'. The filenames vary but end with .dll. This temporary directory is a common place for applications to store files during operations, and it's expected that some files might be deleted once they're no longer needed.\n\nNow, considering all events together: we have multiple file deletions by Dism.exe from the same temporary folder. While Dism.exe's normal operation might involve creating and deleting temporary files as part of deployment or update processes, having so many .dll files being deleted in sequence could be significant. Each deletion is logged, which might indicate that this activity was monitored because it's outside normal user behavior.\n\nHowever, without additional context about whether these deletions are part of a legitimate update or if they're happening at an unusual time (like outside business hours), it's hard to say definitively. But the sheer number and the fact that each is being logged could suggest something is amiss. Maybe Dism.exe was instructed to delete multiple files as part of a malicious payload, or perhaps it's a legitimate operation but triggered inappropriately.\n\nGiven that all these events are very similar and involve deletions from a temporary folder by a known Microsoft process, I lean towards the possibility of them being legitimate. However, the fact that they were detected by a FileDeleteDetected rule suggests that there might be some oversight or concern about why Dism.exe is deleting so many files at once.\n\nIn conclusion, while each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious, the volume and context could indicate something worth investigating further. It's possible that these deletions are part of a larger malicious activity, but without more data, it's challenging to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events shows multiple file deletions by Dism.exe from a temporary directory. While each event individually might not be suspicious, the volume and context suggest potential concern. The consistent use of Dism.exe and the logging indicate they may be legitimate but possibly triggered inappropriately. Further investigation is recommended to determine if these deletions are part of normal operations or malicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"inconclusive\",\n  \"details\": {\n    \"process\": \"Dism.exe\",\n    \"file_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\",\n    \"files_deleted\": [\n      \"Provider.dll\",\n      \"SetupPlatformProvider.dll\",\n      \/\/ ... other files\n    ],\n    \"recommendation\": \"Investigate if these deletions are part of legitimate operations or potential malicious activity.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this JSON data that seems to be logs from some system, maybe related to cybersecurity. There are multiple entries here with keys like \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". Let me try to parse each entry one by one.\n\nThe first few entries don't have a process name but mention \"None\" for the file. The winlog tasks vary, like \"Process Create\" or \"Registry value set\". Then there are some where the process is named, like \"services.exe\" and \"sppsvc.exe\", which might be Windows services or system processes.\n\nLooking further down, I see several entries with a command line that runs powershell.exe. The command creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" using a binary path pointing to a specific .exe file in a directory called \"unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\". After creating the service, it starts it.\n\nThis seems suspicious because:\n1. Creating services with powershell is common for persistence.\n2. The path \"C:\\unidade_logico\" might be a custom or non-standard location, possibly where malicious files are stored.\n3. Repeated entries of the same command line suggest automated or script-based execution, which could be part of an attack.\n\nI should check if these processes are legitimate or related to known malware. The file path and service name don't ring any bells immediately, so I might need to look up if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is associated with any malicious activities. Also, the fact that multiple entries attempt the same task could indicate a script trying to ensure the service is created and started, possibly as part of an infection process.\n\nI think these logs could be indicating a potential system compromise or an ongoing attack where an adversary is setting up persistence mechanisms using PowerShell to create and start services. It's important to verify if \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service on the system or not.\n<\/think>\n\nThe JSON data you provided appears to contain logs related to process creation, system events, and file operations. Each entry has three fields: `process`, `winlog`, and `file`. Here's an analysis of each field:\n\n### 1. Process Field:\n- This field contains information about the process that was created or modified.\n  - If `process` is `None`, it means no specific process was associated with the event.\n  - For example, in one entry, the `process` is `'services.exe'`, which is a legitimate Windows service process.\n\n### 2. Winlog Field:\n- This field contains information about the type of system event or task that occurred.\n  - Common values include:\n    - `'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'`: Indicates a new process was created.\n    - `'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'`: Indicates a registry value was modified.\n    - `'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'`: Indicates a DLL or EXE file was loaded into memory.\n    - `'Windows Update Agent'` or `'Provider Lifecycle'`: These are related to system services or updates.\n\n### 3. File Field:\n- This field contains information about the file associated with the event.\n  - If `file` is `None`, it means no specific file was associated with the event.\n  - For example, in one entry, the `file` path is `'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll'`, which is a legitimate Windows file.\n\n### Analysis of Entries:\n1. **Entry 1**:\n   ```json\n   {\"process\":\"None\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n   ```\n   - This indicates that a new process was created, but no specific process or file is associated with this event.\n\n2. **Entry 2**:\n   ```json\n   {\"process\":\"{'name': 'services.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n   ```\n   - The `services.exe` process modified a registry value, which is a common activity for system services.\n\n3. **Entry 3**:\n   ```json\n   {\"process\":\"{'name': 'sppsvc.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll'\"}\n   ```\n   - The `sppsvc.exe` process loaded the `taskschd.dll` file into memory, which is a legitimate Windows file.\n\n4. **Entry 17**:\n   ```json\n   {\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Provider Lifecycle')\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n   ```\n   - This entry shows that a PowerShell command was executed to create and start a new service named `objeto_ativo`. The binary path for this service points to a file (`tarefa_logico.exe`) located in the directory `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin`.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The use of `powershell.exe` to create and start a new service could indicate malicious activity, as attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for persistence and lateral movement.\n- The file path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` seems unusual and might not be associated with any known legitimate software.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate the Service**:\n   - Check if the service `objeto_ativo` is legitimate or if it was installed by malicious software.\n   - Use tools like `sc query` to list all services and verify their sources.\n\n2. **Inspect the File**:\n   - Analyze the file `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` to determine if it contains any malicious code.\n   - Use antivirus software or tools like `Process Monitor` to monitor its activity.\n\n3. **Review Process Creation Events**:\n   - Investigate how the PowerShell command was triggered and who executed it.\n   - Check for any signs of unauthorized access or compromise.\n\n4. **Monitor System Activity**:\n   - Continuously monitor the system for similar events or unusual activity that could indicate a breach.\n\nIf you suspect malicious activity, it is recommended to isolate the affected system and perform a thorough investigation using appropriate tools and techniques."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with similar command lines in the process field. Most of them are using powershell.exe with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted and running some commands. The first event is a bit different; it's creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using New-Service and starting it. That catches my attention because creating services can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if they're persistent.\n\nLooking at the other events, they all seem to run powershell.exe with restricted execution policies. The commands vary slightly. Some just write 'Final result: 1' to the host, which seems benign. Others are checking INF files in the Windows directory and looking for specific patterns. This might be part of a script trying to detect something on the system.\n\nThe justification I'm considering is that while some events look normal (like running restricted scripts or simple commands), the combination includes creating a service, which could be an attempt at persistence or privilege escalation. The repeated checks on INF files might indicate reconnaissance or attempts to identify certain drivers or components, which could be malicious in nature.\n\nMy confidence level is around 0.7 because while there are red flags, like creating a service and script-based activities, it's possible these are legitimate scripts running during system operations. However, the creation of a new service without clear justification raises suspicion, so I lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell commands that appear to check for specific patterns in INF files and create a new service named 'objeto_ativo'. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior, such as system configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, we have five JSONL entries here, each representing an event from the system logs.\n\nLooking at the first two events, I notice that both involve powershell.exe with a specific command line. The command is checking for certain patterns in .inf files located in the Windows directory. Specifically, it's looking for lines matching '[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]'. This seems like a script trying to detect if any of these files contain particular sections. I know that powershell can be a common tool used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities, so this could be worth looking into.\n\nThe third event mentions \"Security Group Management\" under winlog['task'], which is more about user or group activity. This doesn't immediately raise any red flags but might still be part of routine system management.\n\nThe fourth and fifth events are about services.exe and special logon tasks, respectively. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process related to service management, and the special logon task could be part of normal operations, especially during startup or when certain services need to run under specific credentials.\n\nNow, considering all these together: two events with powershell checking .inf files might indicate an attempt to identify potential vulnerabilities or installers on the system. This could be a precursor to malicious activity, like deploying drivers or software that requires such sections in their INF files. Alternatively, it could be part of a legitimate script for inventory or security purposes.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say definitively if these actions are malicious. But the fact that powershell is being used with ExecutionPolicy Restricted suggests some attempt at controlling the environment, which can sometimes be indicative of malicious behavior aiming to minimize detection.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while not all events are suspicious, the combination, particularly the two powershell executions, could indicate something more nefarious. The confidence level is around 0.7 because there's a possibility it's legitimate scripting, but the nature of the commands and tool used makes me cautious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains two events with powershell.exe executing a command that searches for specific patterns in .inf files, which could indicate malicious activity such as driver installation or system modification.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
