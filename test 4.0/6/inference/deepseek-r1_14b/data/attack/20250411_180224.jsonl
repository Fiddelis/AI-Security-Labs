{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is often used for system administration but can also be a vector for attacks. The command lines have arguments like -ep bypass which suggests that PowerShell is running with elevated privileges, possibly to avoid detection or execute malicious scripts. However, the script paths mentioned (objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1) don't exist according to the data, so maybe those are typos or part of an attempt that failed.\n\nThen there are several schtasks.exe entries used to create scheduled tasks. SchTasks is legitimate but can be misused for persistence. The task names (win32times) and the use of \/ru system suggest they're running under the system account, which could indicate privilege escalation attempts or setting up persistent malware.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe entries, I see registry modifications. SvcHost is a common process that hosts various services, but unusual activity here might be suspicious. The file creation event by svchost to create 'win32times' in the Tasks folder seems concerning as it's not a typical action for this process.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value sets from different processes like cmd.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome can write to the registry for settings, the frequency here might be abnormal. It's unusual to see so many writes from various processes unless something is trying to cover its tracks or establish persistence.\n\nThe entry involving winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file seems legitimate if it's part of the data collection process, but without more context, I'm cautious about any tool writing configuration files as it could be an attacker setting up logging for their activities.\n\nAdditionally, the last few events show chrome.exe making registry changes. While browsers do interact with the registry for settings, the volume here is high, which might indicate a compromise where Chrome is being manipulated or used as part of a larger attack vector.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags: use of PowerShell with elevated privileges, creation of scheduled tasks with suspicious names and system-level execution, modifications to the registry by non-standard processes, and an unusually high number of registry writes across multiple processes. These patterns collectively suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, or fileless malware.\n\nWhile some events could be part of normal operations, the combination points towards a possible attack. Therefore, this batch should be classified as INTERESTING with a moderate confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe usage with elevated privileges, creation of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe, and registry modifications by svchost.exe. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's break down this batch of logs. I'm seeing multiple events from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nFirst event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file. It might be normal since it's part of the log collection setup, but the path seems specific. Then, powershell.exe creates 'entrada_ativo.txt' which could be malicious if it's dropping files or scripts.\n\nNext, there are two ProcessAccess events from powershell.exe. This indicates it's accessing other processes, possibly trying to get information or modify them, which is suspicious. Also, whoami.exe was run without arguments, which alone isn't bad, but combined with the other activity, raises questions.\n\nThe repetition of powershell.exe accessing and creating files makes me think there's a sequence hereâ€”maybe setting up persistence or moving data. The confidence is high because multiple indicators point towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activity combined with file creation and process access may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
