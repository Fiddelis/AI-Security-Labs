{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm going to analyze this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is being accessed. Powershell can be used for legitimate purposes, but it's also commonly abused in attacks. The presence of several ProcessAccess events related to Powershell might indicate suspicious activity, especially when combined with other actions.\n\nLooking further, there are instances where cmd.exe is used with a command line like \"\/c wmic process call create notepad.exe\". Using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) can be a red flag because it's often exploited for remote code execution and persistence. The fact that it's being executed from cmd could mean an attempt to run malicious commands.\n\nAnother point is the creation of new files, such as \"objeto_temporario.txt\" by Powershell.exe. Unusual file creations, especially with .txt extensions, might be part of data exfiltration or setting up temporary storage for malicious activities. Similarly, the creation of \".winlogbeat.yml.new\" seems out of place unless it's related to legitimate software, but given the other suspicious events, it's worth looking into.\n\nThere are also several Registry value sets across different processes like Powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe. Modifying registry entries can be part of creating persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\nAdditionally, the creation of notepad.exe via wmic might be a test to see if certain commands can execute successfully, which is a common tactic in reconnaissance or early stages of an attack.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple Powershell accesses, use of WMIC and cmd for process creation, file creations that seem out of the ordinary, and registry modificationsâ€”this combination raises red flags. It suggests potential malicious activity such as persistence setup, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm also noting that while some events could be legitimate (like Powershell being used for system administration), the sheer number and variety of suspicious indicators make this batch more concerning. The confidence level is high because the patterns align with known attack techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe activities suggest potential malicious behavior including file creation, registry modifications, and process spawning.
