Git is commonly used for version control, so it's normal for it to create or modify files during operations like cloning repositories or installing dependencies. The file paths lead to TypeScript definition files (d.ts) inside the node_modules folder, which suggests these are part of a project's dependencies.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created in quick succession by git.exe could be normal during package installations or updates.

That suggests that Git is being executed or used.\n- **Winlog Task**: Each event reports \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", meaning a file was created.\n- **File Path**: All files are under the same directory structure, specifically within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project. The paths vary slightly but all follow a pattern like \"...\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\" followed by different .d.ts files.\n\nSo, breaking this down:\n\n1. **Process Name (git.exe)**: Git is commonly used for version control and can execute scripts or shell commands.

That makes me think that these are file operations performed by the Git executable. Then there's a \"winlog\" field indicating the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so it's about files being created. The \"file\" path points to various .d.ts files located in the node_modules directory of a Cypress project.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all are under \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" and each one has a specific function name like isError.d.ts, isFinite.d.ts, etc. These seem to be TypeScript type definitions for Lodash functions in a functional programming (fp) context.\n\nSo, the pattern here is consistent across all events: git.exe creating multiple files that are part of the Cypress types for Lodash. Since these are standard file creation events during development or testing with Git and Cypress, it doesn't seem unusual. There's no indication of anything malicious like access to sensitive files, writes to unexpected locations, or any other signs of suspicious activity.\n\nThe user is likely working on a project that uses Cypress for testing and Lodash for utility functions. The creation of these type definition files is part of the build process or when dependencies are updated. So, while each individual file creation might be logged, having multiple such events in a row doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nI should also consider whether multiple FileCreate events from git.exe could indicate something like a directory being created or multiple files added at once. But given that each event is for a specific file and they're all under the same node_modules structure, it's more about installing or updating dependencies rather than malicious behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious activities in this batch of logs.

The logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Let me take a closer look at these events.\n\nFirst, all the entries have similar structures. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path information. The process name is always \"git.exe\". The Windows log task is consistently labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file paths vary slightly but are all located under a specific directory structure.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" followed by different filenames ending with \".d.ts\". The varying parts are things like \"startCase.d.ts\", \"startsWith.d.ts\", and so on. These seem to be TypeScript definition files, which are common in Node.js and npm modules.\n\nNow, considering the context: git.exe is a version control tool used for software development. When someone clones a repository or adds new files, Git might execute scripts or create files as part of its process. The fact that multiple \".d.ts\" files are being created by git.exe could indicate that this is happening during a setup phase, perhaps when initializing a project with npm modules like cypress and lodash.\n\nI should think about whether these events are normal or suspicious. Typically, during development, especially when working with frameworks and libraries, it's common for tools to generate or update type definition files. These \".d.ts\" files help TypeScript understand the structure of the code. So, if a user is setting up their environment and running npm commands, git might trigger these file creations as part of installing dependencies.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be malicious? Malware often tries to hide its activities by using common tools like Git or creating files in standard locations. However, in this case, the paths are deep within a project directory related to \"Qualidade de Software\" (which translates to \"Software Quality\"), suggesting an educational or development context. The filenames are all related to TypeScript definitions for Lodash functions, which is a popular library.\n\nI should also consider the volume of events. There are 14 entries here, each creating a different \".d.ts\" file under the same directory structure. While it's possible for multiple files to be created during an initial setup or cache generation, I wonder if such a large number in a short period is normal. However, without knowing the exact timeline of these events, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAre there any red flags? The process name being git.exe and the file paths being within a node_modules directory make me think this is part of a development environment setup. Malicious actors might not use such specific or standard file creation processes in these locations. Instead, they'd likely create files elsewhere or attempt to modify existing ones.\n\nAdditionally, considering that all events are created by the same process and in the same directory structure, it's less likely to be a sign of compromise and more likely part of legitimate software development activities.\n\nSo, putting this together: The batch shows multiple file creation events from git.exe in a typical node_modules directory. These files are TypeScript definitions for Lodash functions, which is expected behavior when setting up a project with npm modules like Cypress. There's no indication of unusual activity or deviation from standard practices in software development.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a batch of JSONL events, each representing a file creation event by the process \"git.exe\". The files are all .d.ts files located in a node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze if this batch is relevant for investigation. Since it's about file creations, my initial thought is that sometimes such events can indicate malicious activity, like dropped files by malware or creation of new files as part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the details, each event shows git.exe creating a file in a typical node_modules folder. Node_modules are standard in JavaScript\/Node.js projects and contain third-party libraries. The specific paths point to Cypress types for lodash's functional programming utilities. These are legitimate files used by developers when working with frameworks like Cypress or Lodash.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created suggests this might be part of a development workflow, perhaps during a build process or an npm install command. Git.exe is often used in such environments for version control, so it makes sense that it's involved in file operations related to the project structure.\n\nI don't see any red flags here, like files being created in unusual directories, execution attempts, or other indicators of malicious behavior. All the paths are within expected locations for a development setup, and the process is git.exe, which is a common tool in software development environments.\n\nConsidering all these points, it's unlikely that this batch indicates malicious activity. Therefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple .d.ts files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a set of JSONL events to analyze. Each line represents an event where a file was created by the git.exe process. All these files are located under the node_modules directory in a Cypress types folder.\n\nHmm, first off, I know that node_modules is where Node.js packages are stored. Cypress is a testing tool for web applications, and it's common to have its type definitions there. So seeing multiple .d.ts files being created by git.exe doesn't immediately raise any red flags. These events seem pretty standard when working with version control systems like Git.\n\nI remember that sometimes during development or after cloning a repository, Git can create new files as part of the checkout process. It's possible that these events are just Git updating the local copy of the project, which is why it's creating all these type definition files.\n\nWait, but could there be something suspicious here? Let me think. Malicious actors might try to hide their activities by using legitimate processes like git.exe, but in this case, the file paths seem entirely related to a typical development setup. The user's path includes \"inatel\" which I believe is a Brazilian university, so it's likely a student or researcher working on their project.\n\nAlso, all the files are type definitions for Lodash functions within Cypress. That makes sense because Lodash is often used in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects for utility functions, and having these types helps with code completion and static analysis.\n\nIs there any indication of unusual behavior? The same process (git.exe) creating multiple files under a predictable directory structure doesn't seem out of the ordinary. If this were an attack, I might expect more varied file paths or attempts to create executable files, but here it's all within a node_modules\/types folder, which is standard.\n\nI should also consider if these events are part of a larger pattern. Since each event is isolated and just involves creating type files, there's no sign of deletions, modifications, or other actions that could indicate tampering. The volume of eventsâ€”14 in totalâ€”isn't particularly high either; it's within normal bounds for a project with many dependencies.\n\nIn summary, while every situation needs careful review, especially in security contexts, the information here doesn't suggest any malicious activity. It looks like standard development operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during development or repository setup and does not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So the user has given a series of JSONL events, each indicating that git.exe created a file in a specific path. My task is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that all events are from the same process, git.exe. Git is commonly used for version control, so these could be normal operations like cloning repositories or updating files. The paths point to node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/*.d.ts, which suggests they're part of a project using Cypress and Lodash.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have the same task: File created under the rule FileCreate. This repetition makes me think it's not suspicious; it's likely git updating or creating files during a build or installation process.\n\nI also consider the file paths. The locations are standard for npm modules, which again points to normal development activities. There's no indication of anything malicious here, like access to sensitive files or unusual directories.\n\nSince all events are similar and relate to expected behavior when using git with these tools, I don't see any red flags. No anomalies in the timestamps or file accesses that would warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch doesn't seem relevant for an investigation. It's just normal file creation during development processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by git.exe in a typical development environment context (node_modules and cypress types folder), which is expected behavior for software development.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each one is a JSON object, and they all seem to be similar. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, each event has three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name is always \"git.exe\". That makes sense because Git is a version control system used for code management. So someone is using Git on their machine.\n\nThe winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that each event is logging the creation of a new file. Looking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\\". That seems to be a user's directory on their local machine.\n\nThe files being created are in the \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\" folder. The specific file names vary, but they all end with \".d.ts\", which I think stands for declaration TypeScript files. These are typically used in TypeScript projects to provide type information for modules that don't have their own type definitions.\n\nSo putting this together, it looks like Git is creating a bunch of files in the node_modules directory under a Cypress project. This could be during an npm install or when running commands like \"npm run build\" or \"yarn\". It's common for development tools to generate such files as part of their operation, especially with TypeScript projects.\n\nI'm thinking about why this might be interesting or not. If Git is creating these files in a typical project setup, it's probably normal behavior. There's no indication of any unusual activity like access to restricted directories, failed login attempts, or other signs of malicious intent. The user named \"fiddelis\" seems to be working on their S206 - Qualidade de Software project, which is likely related to software quality, maybe a course assignment.\n\nI should also consider the frequency and volume of these events. There are 14 entries here, each creating a file in quick succession. This could be part of a script or build process that's generating multiple files at once. It doesn't raise any red flags because it's consistent with development activities.\n\nAnother angle is to check if \"git.exe\" is associated with any known malicious activity. From what I know, Git is a standard tool used by developers and isn't inherently malicious. Unless there's evidence of tampered executables or unusual command-line arguments, the process seems benign.\n\nThe file paths also don't seem suspicious. They're within the project directory, which is typical for node_modules. There's no indication that files are being created in system directories or outside the user's control, which would be a bigger concern.\n\nIn summary, all these events point to normal development activities where Git is part of building or managing a project. The repeated creation of TypeScript declaration files under Cypress suggests a standard setup with those tools. Without any signs of anomalies or deviations from expected behavior, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by Git during development in a TypeScript project using Cypress and lodash.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is from the Windows log and involves the creation of files by git.exe. The paths are all under the node_modules directory for cypress and lodash types.

Git.exe is typically used for version control, but in this context, since it's creating files under node_modules, it might be part of a build process or installing dependencies.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all end with .d.ts, which are TypeScript declaration files. These are usually generated by tools like TypeScript to provide type information for JavaScript code. So, git.exe creating these files doesn't seem unusual if it's involved in building or managing the project's dependencies.\n\nThe events repeat multiple times, each time creating a different .d.ts file under lodash and iteratee, kebabCase, etc. Since all these are part of the node_modules structure, it suggests that this is during a setup phase where these files are being generated as part of the build or installation process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unexpected paths, no access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, and the file types are standard for development tools. It's likely just normal operation when setting up or updating a project that uses TypeScript with Cypress testing framework.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't indicate anything suspicious.

My task is to analyze them as a whole and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, let me look at the events. Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. All of these events have similar structures: they involve the process \"git.exe\", a task indicating that a file was created (rule: FileCreate), and the path to the file.\n\nLooking closer at the paths, all files are under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\". The filenames vary but end with \".d.ts\", which suggests they're TypeScript declaration files. These are typically created when building or installing node modules, especially in projects using tools like npm or yarn.\n\nEach event is a file creation by git.exe. Now, I know that git can perform various operations, including cloning repositories, checking out branches, and managing submodules. When you clone a repository, it's common for Git to create files in the process, especially when initializing submodules or downloading dependencies.\n\nThe path \"node_modules\" is familiarâ€”it's where node.js packages are stored. Since these events are all related to creating TypeScript declaration files under the cypress types lodash directory, it suggests that Git is involved in managing or updating this project's dependencies. Cypress is a testing framework for JavaScript applications, so having its type definitions is standard for projects using TypeScript.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool. The file paths are within the expected locations for node modules and their types. The creation of multiple files at once could be part of an install or update process, especially if these type definitions were just added or updated.\n\nAlso, considering that all events have the same structure and origin, it's likely they're part of a single operationâ€”perhaps a Git pull or fetch where several files needed for the project are being created. Since nothing stands out as unusual, such as unexpected file paths, access to sensitive areas, or signs of tampering, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.

So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, each line being a JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation. The output should be a single classificationâ€”either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\"â€”along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening. Each line starts with the process name being \"git.exe\". That suggests that Git is involved here since Git is commonly used for version control in software development. The \"winlog\" field indicates that it's related to Windows logging, specifically a file creation event under the rule \"FileCreate\". \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to files within \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\". The filenames are various \".d.ts\" files, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are typically used in TypeScript projects to provide type information for JavaScript libraries when using modules like Lodash.\n\nSo, each event shows that Git is creating a file in this specific directory. Since all the events have the same process name and similar file paths, it seems consistent with normal development activities. For instance, if someone is working on a project that uses Node.js or TypeScript, they might be installing dependencies using npm or yarn, which would trigger Git to update files in node_modules.\n\nI don't immediately see any signs of malicious behavior here. The files being created are standard declaration files for Lodash, a well-known and widely used library. There's no indication of unusual file names, locations outside the expected project structure, or activities that would raise red flags such as multiple failed access attempts, writes to unexpected directories, or execution of scripts.\n\nAnother point is that all these events are from the same process, \"git.exe\", which suggests it's part of a script or automated task during development. It's common for developers to have tools like Git and npm running together when setting up or updating project dependencies. The repetitive creation of multiple files in the node_modules directory also aligns with how package managers workâ€”they extract and organize module files upon installation.\n\nI should consider if there are any atypical patterns here, but I don't see any. All events follow a similar structure, which is typical for legitimate activities during development or setup phases. There's no evidence of rapid file creation, access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, or other indicators that might suggest an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nIn terms of confidence, since all these actions are consistent with normal software development workflows and there's no deviation from expected behavior, I'm highly confident that this batch isn't indicative of malicious activity.

That makes sense because when you work with version control systems like Git, it's common for scripts or processes to create files in your project directory. The path looks like a typical node_modules folder, which suggests this is part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project using tools like npm or yarn.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under the lodash types directory. Lodash is a popular utility library in JavaScript, and having its type definitions makes sense for projects that use static type checking with tools like TypeScript.

When you clone a repository or pull updates, Git might update or create such files as part of its normal operation, especially if scripts run post-checkout to set up environments.\n\nI should consider why these events would be flagged for investigation. Malicious activities often involve unauthorized access, execution of binaries, or attempts to modify sensitive areas of the system. But here, git.exe is acting normally within a development environment. There's no indication of unusual file creation locations outside expected project directories or signs of privilege escalation.\n\nAnother angle is checking if creating these files in bulk could indicate something like a build process gone wrong or a script misbehavior. However, given that it's node_modules and type definitions, this seems like legitimate activity during development or testing setup.\n\nI also notice all events are from the same user account, which is expected in a typical setup where a single user is working on their machine. There's no evidence of multiple users or remote sessions, which might raise flags.\n\nConsidering the confidence level: since everything aligns with normal development processes and there's nothing indicating unauthorized access or malicious intent, I'd say this batch isn't particularly concerning.

Without any deviations from standard behavior, there's no need to investigate further.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch doesn't present any signs of malicious activity. Therefore, it's classified as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation activities by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical for development environments and does not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a batch of four JSONL events, each representing some file creation activity on a Windows system. The process name is git.exe in all cases, which makes sense because Git uses its own executables for various operations. Each event mentions that a file was created under the same directory path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\. The filenames vary but are all .d.ts files, which I know is TypeScript declaration files. These are typically part of a project's setup, especially when using tools like Cypress and Node.js.\n\nHmm, so why would multiple files be created at once? Well, Git might be performing some operation that involves creating or updating these files as part of cloning a repository, pulling updates, or during a build process. Since all events are from the same user (fiddelis) and the path structure looks like it's part of a development environment, this seems normal.\n\nI should consider if there's anything unusual here. Are these file creations happening outside expected times? The log doesn't show timestamps, so I can't tell how recent they are. But given that Git operations often involve creating multiple files at once, especially during initial clones or syncs, this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nLooking deeper, the fact that all events are under node_modules and cypress suggests it's part of a JavaScript project setup. The 'lodash' folder is common in such projects for utility functions. So each .d.ts file being created might be necessary steps during the setup or build process.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior? None that I can see. No signs like writes to unexpected locations, execution of scripts, or attempts to access sensitive files. It's purely creation of expected project-related files by a legitimate process (git.exe).\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem interesting from a security perspective. It looks like standard development activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities related to a Git operation in a development environment, indicating legitimate behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
