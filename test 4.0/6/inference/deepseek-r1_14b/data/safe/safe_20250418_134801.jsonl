{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm presented with a batch of system log events and need to determine if this entire set is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are multiple entries involving MicrosoftEdge.exe processes creating files. Specifically, they're creating setup.exe in temporary directories. This seems normal since Edge updates might trigger such activities. Then, CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll—these are legitimate Windows Defender components, so no red flags there.\n\nNext, I see setup.exe creating a pipe event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is standard in many applications. Services.exe and related processes handling logon events, along with special logons, are typical for system services starting up or users logging in—nothing suspicious yet.\n\nThere's a series of User Account Management tasks without associated files. These could just be system-level account checks or updates, common during login processes. Moving on, taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll is normal since Task Scheduler uses this DLL, and svchost.exe modifying registry values is standard for services running under svchost.\n\nThe more interesting event comes from powershell.exe execution with a command line. The command checks for INF files in the Windows directory and looks for specific patterns. While using PowerShell can be legitimate, the script seems to search for installation configuration files and set a result based on finding them. This could be part of an automated check or might be attempting something malicious like lateral movement. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is harmful.\n\nLooking at other events: chrome.exe making DNS queries is normal user activity, and the creation of a PowerShell profile data file is standard when using PowerShell for the first time in a session.\n\nConsidering all these together, most events are typical system and application activities. The only potentially concerning part is the PowerShell script checking INF files. However, without evidence of other malicious behaviors like network traffic or known indicators, this alone isn't enough to classify the entire batch as interesting. It might just be a legitimate script or part of an update process.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all events collectively, there's not sufficient information to indicate malicious activity beyond normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system activities such as file creation by Microsoft Edge, loading of known DLLs, and PowerShell execution with no indication of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting logs, so that seems normal—it's probably just setting up its configuration file. Not suspicious at all.\n\nNext, svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common system process and often runs services, but sometimes it's used by malware too. However, the task here is \"RegistryEvent,\" which could be anything. I'll keep this in mind but not flag it yet.\n\nThen another instance of svchost.exe doing the same thing— Registry value set. This might just be multiple services running under svchost, so unless there's unusual activity elsewhere, this isn't a red flag.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a benign process, and urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs. No issues here.\n\nAnother svchost.exe starting with command line parameters for BthAvctpSvc service. That sounds legitimate as services often run under svchost with specific parameters. Nothing to worry about here.\n\nChrome.exe setting a registry value. Chrome sometimes does this during updates or configuration changes, so it's normal. Not a concern.\n\nMsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll. MsMpEng is related to Windows Defender, and taskschd is the Task Scheduler DLL. This makes sense as part of defender's operations. Safe.\n\nAnother winlogbeat file creation—same as the first one, nothing unusual.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again. CompatTelRunner is associated with the Compatibility Telemetry service, which is standard Windows behavior. No problem here.\n\nThen svchost.exe creating files in NetworkService profile under DeliveryOptimization. That's a known Windows feature for optimizing file delivery over the network. The paths look legitimate; not suspicious.\n\nMore svchost.exe creating files in the same directory. Still within expected Windows updates or optimizations, so nothing wrong here.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file and then deleting it. Edge updates often download and then install or delete temp files, which is normal behavior. The FileDeleteDetected event might look alarming, but it's just part of the update process.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading some Defender-related DLLs and creating a lock file in Temp. MpCmdRun is used by Windows Defender for various operations, including scans. Creating temp files is standard for such processes. Not an issue.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is typically related to console windows, and mintty is often used with Cygwin or other terminal emulators. Unless there's evidence of unauthorized access, these seem fine.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are standard system processes doing their normal tasks—log collection, service runs, updates, antivirus operations. I don't see any signs of malicious behavior like unusual file creations in unexpected locations, multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force, or processes running without proper permissions.\n\nThe only thing that caught my eye a bit is the repeated registry events from svchost.exe and chrome.exe, but again, these are common activities.

Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first two events involve \"MpCmdRun.exe\" loading some DLL files related to Windows Defender. That seems normal since MpCmdRun is a known process used by Windows Defender for command-line operations. It's expected that it would load these files when running.\n\nThen there's an event with null values in all categories, which might be an error or just noise and not significant on its own.\n\nThe remaining events are all from \"git.exe\" creating several JavaScript files within a node_modules directory. This looks like a user installing or updating a Node.js package since git is commonly used for version control in such projects. The paths look standard for a typical development setup, so these file creations don't raise any red flags.\n\nPutting it all together, there's nothing unusual here.

My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of each event. They all have similar keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The process name is consistently \"git.exe\" across all events. The winlog task is always about a file being created, with a specific rule mentioned. The file paths are varying but follow a pattern.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located in a user's Downloads folder under a directory named after a course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"). Inside that, there's a \"node_modules\" folder, which is typical for Node.js projects. Specifically, these events are creating files within the \"semver\" module and its subdirectories like functions, internal, etc.\n\nSemver stands for semantic versioning, and it's a common tool used in software development to manage dependencies. The fact that these files are being created as part of a Node.js module setup doesn't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nNow, considering the context: \"git.exe\" is creating multiple files. This could be during a git clone operation or when initializing a new repository. The creation of several files in the node_modules directory suggests someone is setting up or updating their development environment, which is normal behavior for a developer.\n\nEach event is isolated to file creation under semver. There's no indication of any access to sensitive files, execution of malicious code, or other activities that would typically warrant investigation. The events are consistent and follow a predictable pattern typical of software development workflows.\n\nI also notice that all these events have the same task in winlog: \"File created\". This uniformity suggests it's part of a larger, automated process rather than individual manual actions, which is common during development setup or CI\/CD pipelines.\n\nGiven that there are no signs of unusual access times, anomalies in file sizes, or attempts to execute these files immediately after creation, the activities appear benign. The paths accessed and the nature of the operations don't point towards any malicious intent.\n\nTherefore, considering all events together, they don't indicate any suspicious behavior. They're part of normal software development processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show a legitimate process (git.exe) creating files within the node_modules directory during setup or updates, which is typical in software development.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is from the same process, git.exe, and they all indicate that files were created in a specific directory related to node_modules\/semver. \n\nHmm, semver stands for semantic versioning, which is commonly used in software packages. The paths like parse-options.js and ranges\/*.js are typical parts of a Node.js module. Since these events show multiple file creations under the same process and location, it looks like git.exe is cloning or extracting this node_modules\/semver package.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. All the actions are related to setting up a development environment, probably during a git operation like a clone or install. There's nothing unusual about file creation in a standard module structure. No unexpected processes, network connections, or file accesses that would raise red flags.\n\nSo, overall, this batch doesn't seem interesting from a security perspective.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I have a batch of events to analyze. Each event is a JSON object representing some system activity. The user wants me to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the events, they all seem similar. Each one has \"git.exe\" as the process name, and the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file paths are all within a node_modules directory under a course named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". They include files like package.json, README.md, LICENSE.txt, and others typical of a Node.js project setup.\n\nSo, the common thread here is that git.exe is creating multiple files in a node_modules folder. This looks like someone is cloning or initializing a Git repository within this directory, installing dependencies, which would involve creating these files as part of package installations.\n\nI need to consider whether this activity is normal or suspicious. Using Git for development and managing packages with npm usually involves creating many files and directories under node_modules. So, seeing multiple FileCreate events from git.exe in that context seems expected during a typical software development workflow.\n\nIs there anything unusual here? The user's environment might be a development machine where such activities are standard. There’s no indication of any failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or anomalies like times outside normal working hours. All file paths are within the expected project structure, and the files created are standard for npm packages.\n\nTherefore, while each individual event isn't alarming on its own, taken together as a batch, they show consistent behavior that's part of legitimate development processes. There's no evidence of malicious intent or unauthorized access in these logs.\n\nSo, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are routine and don’t raise any red flags for potential security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is typical during npm package installations and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Every event involves git.exe creating a file, and the files are various components of node modules like LICENSE, README.md, index.js, etc. The paths consistently go through \"node_modules\", which is typical for JavaScript projects where dependencies are stored.\n\nI'm noticing that each event is just a file creation by git.exe in a node_modules directory. This seems normal because when you clone a repository using Git, especially one that includes npm packages, Git would create these files as part of the checkout process. The presence of multiple small files like LICENSE and README.md also aligns with standard package structures.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual file paths, access to sensitive areas, or unexpected processes creating these files. All activities are confined within a user's downloads directory and relate to software development tools and libraries.\n\nGiven that all events involve expected behavior during the setup or cloning of a project using Git and npm, there's no reason to flag this batch as interesting for further investigation.

The paths all start with C:\\Users\\... which points to a user directory on Windows. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're under \"node_modules\", which I know is where Node.js packages are stored. Each event shows different files being created—like package.json, README.md, and some .js files. Also, there's a test folder with index.js inside it.

For instance, signal-exit, slice-ansi, and sshpk are all known npm packages.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is involved suggests this could be part of a git repository setup or during the download and installation of these node modules. Each event shows the creation of different files within these modules, which is standard when setting up a project that relies on Node.js dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All activities are consistent with normal software development practices—cloning repositories, installing packages, or perhaps syncing code. There's no indication of file access rights being changed, attempts to execute unknown scripts, or other red flags typically associated with malicious activity.\n\nIt's possible that this is part of a build process or deployment, where the system is setting up dependencies automatically.

So, I'm given a batch of 15 JSONL events, each representing some file creation activity on a Windows system. My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, let me look at what each event contains. Each JSON object has three main parts: process info, windows log info, and file details. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which tells me that Git is the application performing these actions. The windows log task mentions \"File created\" with a specific rule, so it's related to creating files. The file paths all point to various locations within a node_modules directory, specifically under \"sshpk\". \n\nHmm, okay. So, each event indicates that Git has created a new file in the sshpk module of a Node.js project. The paths vary but are all part of this module's structure. I see files like .js scripts, man pages, and some other binaries. These look like they're part of the standard setup when you install or clone a repository with node_modules.\n\nNow, considering that these events all come from the same process (git.exe) and are creating multiple files in a predictable location related to a Node.js package, this seems pretty normal during development. When you run commands like `npm install` or clone a repository, Git might be used to track changes, and node_modules gets populated with various packages and their files.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The file paths are standard for a software project's dependencies. There's no indication of unusual access times, permissions changes, or other activities that would suggest malicious behavior. Also, the frequency of these events seems within the expected range for installing or updating dependencies in a development environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple files being created by Git in a node_modules directory during what appears to be normal software development activity. No signs of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious signs.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities described are typical and don't raise any security concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory, likely part of normal software development or package installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event logs a file creation under different paths within a node_modules directory. For example, the paths include things like package.json, index.js, license, etc., which are typical files found in a Node.js module structure.\n\nHmm, so git.exe creating files in a node_modules folder—this seems pretty standard. Usually, when you clone or pull a repository using Git, it creates all the necessary files and directories. The paths here don't seem suspicious; they're just part of the project setup.\n\nI should consider if these actions are indicative of malicious behavior.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each line is a JSON object representing an event. All of them have the same structure: process name, Windows log task, and file path. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which immediately makes me think of Git, a version control system. That's common in development environments, so I'm not suspicious there.\n\nThe task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", meaning that a file was created. So all these events are about files being created by Git. The paths point to various JavaScript files inside the node_modules folder for a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Node modules are standard parts of Node.js applications, and having them in a project is normal.\n\nLooking at the file paths more closely, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\" followed by different JS files. Tcomb is a library for type checking in JavaScript. It's a legitimate package, often used in projects. The fact that multiple files are being created under this directory suggests that Git might be cloning or initializing the repository and setting up these modules.\n\nNow, considering possible malicious activities, I don't see any red flags here. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file names, or execution logs. All actions align with normal development processes where Git is handling files in a project's node_modules directory. These are expected behaviors when working with JavaScript projects and version control.\n\nI also think about the context of the user. Since these paths include \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", it seems like an educational or academic project. Students or developers working on such projects would naturally use Git to manage their code, which includes creating files in node_modules as dependencies are installed or updated.\n\nAnother point is that each event creates a different file under the tcomb library. This could be part of installing or updating dependencies via npm, which is a standard process and not indicative of malicious activity. Malware or attacks usually don't create multiple small JS files in such a structured manner; they often look for more direct ways to execute or alter system configurations.\n\nAdditionally, all events are from the same source (git.exe) and target similar directories. There's no variation that might suggest different activities or attempts at covering tracks. The consistency here supports the idea that this is routine development work rather than something suspicious.\n\nI also consider if there could be any hidden indicators of compromise I'm missing, but given the information provided—file creation events by Git in a typical project structure—I don't see any signs of malicious intent. Unless there's context outside these logs indicating otherwise, these events are just part of normal operations.\n\nIn summary, all the events describe legitimate file creation activities by Git during the setup or operation of a Node.js project. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, unusual behavior, or signs of an attack. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating files in a Node.js project's node_modules directory, which is normal during development.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The process name in each event is \"git.exe\", which tells me it's related to Git, probably during some development activity. The task is \"File created\" according to the winlog field, and the file paths are all within a node_modules directory under a specific user's Downloads folder.\n\nHmm, node_modules suggests it's part of a Node.js project. The files being created are various .js and .d.ts files in the tcomb library. Tcomb is a type checking library for JavaScript\/TypeScript. So, these events seem to be part of normal development operations where Git is cloning or updating dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. No unusual file paths, no suspicious processes other than Git which is expected in a dev environment. The repetition of creating files by the same process and in the same directory indicates it's likely a build or install step during project setup.\n\nThe confidence level is high because all events are consistent with standard development activities. There's nothing out of place that would raise red flags for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file creation events by git.exe during normal Node.js module installation, which is typical in a development environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
