{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries related to processes loading images. For example, SDXHelper.exe is loading several DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. That seems repetitive. Then taskhostw.exe is loading taskschd.dll twice. Also, services.exe has a logon event, and there's a special logon entry without a process name, which might be something to look into.\n\nThere are some DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe, which could indicate network activity but not necessarily malicious unless the domains resolved are suspicious. Then, powershell.exe is involved in loading several .NET framework DLLs, which is normal when PowerShell runs scripts, but there's also a file creation event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1. That temp file might be a sign of script execution, possibly testing policy enforcement.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, the repetitive loading of DLLs by SDXHelper.exe could indicate it's part of a legitimate process, but without knowing what SDXHelper is supposed to do, it's hard to say. The creation of a temp PowerShell script might be more concerning because that often happens in attacks to execute malicious code under the radar.\n\nI'm not seeing signs of obvious breaches like failed logins or unusual registry modifications beyond the standard events. However, the combination of multiple image loads and file creations by known scripts could be part of an attack vector. The confidence isn't super high, but there are enough red flags to warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events related to process creation, image loading, and file operations that could indicate potential malicious activity, such as repeated DNS queries and the creation of a temporary PowerShell script.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. The output should be a single classification: either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. powershell.exe is deleting a file located in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The filename has .mdx.ps1 which suggests it's a PowerShell script. Deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but PowerShell scripts can be malicious.\n\n2. There are multiple events where powershell.exe creates pipes and interacts with the system. This could be normal administrative tasks or potentially something more nefarious like communication channels for malware.\n\n3. The next few entries show Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle activities from powershell.exe. These are standard operations when PowerShell starts up, so they might not raise red flags on their own.\n\n4. There's an event where HxTsr.exe sets a registry value. I'm not sure what HxTsr.exe is; it doesn't ring any bells immediately. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate software installation or malicious activity.\n\n5. Then there are events related to py.exe and python.exe. These could be normal Python script executions, but sometimes attackers use these as launchers for other activities. The command lines don't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- The process names vary between powershell.exe, HxTsr.exe, py.exe, and python.exe.\n- There are multiple instances of Image Load events which track when a program loads another module or DLL. For instance, MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's expected. urlmon.dll is also a standard system file.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch, I'm trying to see if there's any pattern or combination that stands out as malicious.\n\nOne thing that catches my eye is the initial event where powershell.exe deletes a script file. The filename __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1 seems generic but could be part of a test script or something more malicious trying to remove evidence. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe multiple Provider and Engine Lifecycle events from PowerShell might indicate that the system is being managed through scripts, which isn't unusual. The pipe creation could be for legitimate inter-process communication, but sometimes attackers use pipes as channels for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nThe HxTsr.exe setting a registry value alone doesn't provide enough information. It could be part of some system tool or a malicious process.\n\nThe Python-related events are also common since many scripts and tools are written in Python. The presence of various DLLs being loaded by python.exe seems normal for running Python applications, especially those with modules like vcruntime140.dll, which is part of the Visual C++ runtime used by some Python distributions.\n\nPutting it all together, I don't see any clear indicators of malicious activity across the batch. The events are a mix of normal system operations and script executions. While each individual event could potentially be suspicious in isolation (like deleting files or creating pipes), collectively they don't present a coherent pattern that suggests an attack. \n\nTherefore, my initial thought is that this batch might not be particularly interesting for investigation unless there's additional context pointing to malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system operations and script executions without clear indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst up, there are two entries where the process name is \"python.exe\" and the task is \"Image loaded\". The files involved are \"_ctypes.pyd\" and \"libffi-8.dll\". These look like standard Python DLLs. Since Python often loads these when running scripts or applications, I don't see anything suspicious here unless there's an unusual context, which isn't provided.\n\nNext, the third event is about \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is a known tool used for forwarding Windows logs to Elasticsearch. It's legitimate software, so this activity is expected and not concerning.\n\nThen, there are three events involving \"SDXHelper.exe\" making DNS queries. SDXHelper is related to the Windows Server 2019 Update Technical Preview and handles DNS settings. These queries could be normal as part of system updates or configuration. Without signs like repeated failed queries or unusual domains, this doesn't raise red flags.\n\nLastly, there's an event from \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is part of Windows' User Account Control (UAC) and handles elevation of privileges. While it can be related to malicious activities if UAC is bypassed, in this case, it's just logging a registry change without any indication of tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nPutting all these together, none of the events individually or collectively suggest malicious behavior. They're all within normal operational ranges for software like Python, log management tools, system updates, and Windows services.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system operations including Python DLL loading, legitimate file creation by winlogbeat.exe, DNS queries related to SDXHelper.exe which is part of Windows Server updates, and registry changes from RuntimeBroker.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
