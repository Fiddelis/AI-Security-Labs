{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This is a JSON log file that contains security-related events from an Windows system. The log format includes the following information:\n\n* `process`: Information about the process that triggered the event, including its name and command line (if available).\n* `winlog`: Details about the Windows Log Event that was triggered by the process, including the task or operation performed.\n* `file`: Information about a file related to the event, such as its path.\n\nBased on the events in this log file, it appears that there are several suspicious activities:\n\n1. **Malicious scripts**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with malicious-looking commands. For example:\n\t* `\"powershell.exe\", \"command_line\": \"'\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"'\"` - This suggests a script is trying to execute the `whoami.exe` command.\n\t* `\"powershell.exe\", \"command_line\": '\"\\\"powershell.exe\\\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\"'` - This suggests a script is attempting to delete a file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the temporary directory.\n2. **File access and modification**: There are several instances of files being created, accessed, or deleted:\n\t* `\"powershell.exe\", \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"}\"`, \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1\"}}` - This suggests a file is being created in the temporary directory.\n\t* `\"powershell.exe\", \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\"}\"`, \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1\"}}` - This suggests a file is being deleted.\n3. **Registry value changes**: There are multiple instances of registry values being set:\n\t* `\"svchost.exe\", \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"}`\n\t* `\"powershell.exe\", \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"}`\n\nIt's essential to investigate these events further and analyze the context in which they occurred. This could involve examining the system's security settings, checking for any malware infections, or reviewing logs from other security-related tools.\n\nSome possible next steps:\n\n1. **Verify file existence**: Confirm whether the files mentioned in the log (e.g., `entrada_principal.zip`, `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) exist on the system.\n2. **Check registry changes**: Inspect the registry to see if any suspicious or unauthorized values have been set.\n3. **Analyze PowerShell scripts**: Review the contents of the malicious-looking PowerShell scripts mentioned in the log to understand their behavior and potential impact.\n4. **Conduct a full system scan**: Perform a thorough malware scan on the system using reputable security tools to identify and remove any potentially malicious software.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an analysis based on the provided JSON log data, and further investigation may be necessary to fully understand the context and severity of these events."}
