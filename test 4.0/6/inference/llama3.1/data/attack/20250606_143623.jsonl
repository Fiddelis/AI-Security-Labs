The log entries are in JSON format and contain information about processes, Windows events, and files.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the fields in each log entry:\n\n1. `process`: Contains information about the process that triggered the event.\n\t* `name`: The name of the process.\n\t* `command_line`: The command line arguments used to launch the process.\n2. `winlog`: Contains information about the Windows event that triggered the alert.\n\t* `task`: The task or event that occurred, such as \"Process Create\" or \"Registry value set\".\n3. `file`: Contains information about a file related to the event (not always present).\n\nSome notable entries in the log:\n\n1. Entry 4: A process named `services.exe` is creating a registry value.\n2. Entry 5: A process named `sppsvc.exe` loads an image from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll`.\n3. Entries 11-17: Multiple instances of PowerShell are executing commands to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to `tarefa_logico.exe`. This suggests a malicious activity, possibly related to malware or lateral movement.\n\nTo analyze this log further, you would need to examine each entry in context and investigate the processes, Windows events, and files mentioned. You may also want to consider using a SIEM or IDS tool to filter and prioritize the alerts based on severity and relevance."}
