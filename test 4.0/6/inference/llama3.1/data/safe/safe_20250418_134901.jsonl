{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from Winlogbeat, which collects Windows event logs and sends them to an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for analysis.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the log entries:\n\n**Initial Entries**\n\n* The first three entries are likely system initialization or startup events.\n* `{\"process\":null,\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"None\"},\"file\":null}` indicates that no specific process is involved in this event, and there are no file or registry modifications.\n\n**Process Creation**\n\n* `{\"process\":{\"name\":\"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\"}}` shows the creation of a new file `.winlogbeat.yml.new` by the `winlogbeat.exe` process.\n* This suggests that Winlogbeat is starting up and creating a configuration file.\n\n**Other Events**\n\n* The remaining entries are mostly registry value sets (rule: RegistryEvent) by various processes, including:\n\t+ `svchost.exe`: a Windows system service host\n\t+ `chrome.exe`: the Google Chrome browser process\n\t+ `notepad.exe`: a Notepad process\n\t+ `Calculator.exe`: a Calculator application\n* There are also some DNS query events (rule: DnsQuery) by the `chrome.exe` process.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe log file suggests that Winlogbeat is running and collecting various system events, including process creation, registry value sets, and DNS queries. The frequent occurrence of registry value sets by `svchost.exe` might indicate some configuration changes or updates to Windows services.\n\nTo better understand these events, you may want to investigate the specific rules (e.g., FileCreate, RegistryEvent) and the corresponding event descriptions in the Winlogbeat documentation. Additionally, analyzing the data with Kibana can provide more insights into the frequency and patterns of these events over time."}
