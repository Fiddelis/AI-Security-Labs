{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This JSON data appears to be a collection of Windows event logs, specifically related to process creation and execution. Each object in the array represents an individual log entry.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key fields in each object:\n\n1. `process`: An object containing information about the process that was created or executed:\n\t* `name`: The name of the process.\n\t* `command_line` (optional): The command line arguments used to launch the process.\n2. `winlog`: An object containing information about the Windows event log entry:\n\t* `task`: A string describing the type of event that occurred, such as \"Process Create\" or \"Registry value set\".\n3. `file`: An optional object containing information about a file related to the process or event:\n\t* `path`: The full path to the file.\n\nSome observations from this data:\n\n* There are multiple instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) being launched, often with suspicious command-line arguments.\n* Files such as `taskschd.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, and `clr.dll` are being loaded into memory, which could be indicative of malware activity.\n* Registry values are being set or accessed by various processes.\n* The presence of a file named `entrada_principal.zip` in the `%TEMP%` directory suggests that an executable may have been downloaded and executed from there.\n\nTo analyze this data further, you might want to:\n\n1. Filter the logs to focus on specific types of events (e.g., process creation or registry changes).\n2. Look for patterns in the command-line arguments used to launch processes.\n3. Investigate the files being loaded into memory, including their paths and timestamps.\n4. Research any suspicious processes or files identified in the data.\n\nIf you have more context about this data, such as the source of the logs (e.g., an intrusion detection system) or a specific time frame for analysis, I can provide more tailored suggestions for your investigation."}
