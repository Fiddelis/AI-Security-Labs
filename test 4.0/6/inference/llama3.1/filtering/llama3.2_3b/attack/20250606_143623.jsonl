{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"These are log entries in the format of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) that seem to be generated by a security information and event management (SIEM) system, possibly Splunk. Each entry is an object with three keys: `process`, `winlog`, and `file`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each key:\n\n1. **`process`:** This key contains information about the process that was detected or created. In the successful execution of PowerShell command, we can see details like `'command_line'`.\n2. **`winlog`:** This part seems to contain Windows Log (Event) related information. It includes tasks associated with specific rules or events on the system. However, it's not very detailed in these examples.\n3. **`file`:** This key is empty (\"None\") in all three logs provided, suggesting there was no notable file activity detected during the time of these log entries.\n\nThe actual interesting part comes from the PowerShell command that seems to be executed as part of a larger process or script, possibly with malicious intent, given its execution via `powershell.exe`. The command attempts to create and start a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese) targeting an executable file named \"tarefa_logico.exe\"."}
