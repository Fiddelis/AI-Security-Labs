{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log of events from an intrusion detection system (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) tool, specifically related to PowerShell execution on a Windows system. I'll break down the key points:\n\n**Events:**\n\n1. **Process Create:** Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are created.\n2. **Registry value set:** A registry value is set, likely by one of the PowerShell processes.\n3. **Process accessed:** The PowerShell process accesses various files and DLLs.\n4. **Image loaded:** Several DLLs and executables are loaded into memory by the PowerShell process.\n5. **File Delete logged:** A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) is deleted, which might be a script or a policy file related to PowerShell execution.\n6. **Provider Lifecycle:** Events related to provider lifecycle management are recorded.\n\n**Files and processes involved:**\n\n* `powershell.exe` (multiple instances)\n* DLLs:\n\t+ `mscoree.dll`\n\t+ `mscoreei.dll`\n\t+ `mscorlib.ni.dll`\n\t+ `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`\n* Files:\n\t+ `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`\n\n**Command lines:**\n\nSome of the events have command lines associated with them. These are PowerShell commands that might be executed by the PowerShell processes:\n\n* `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`\n* `$Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`\n\nThese command lines suggest that the PowerShell processes are executing scripts or performing actions related to registry values, file access, and system configuration.\n\nOverall, this log suggests a series of PowerShell-related events on a Windows system, including process creation, registry value setting, DLL loading, file deletion, and lifecycle management. The exact intentions behind these actions require further analysis and context-specific expertise in PowerShell usage, Windows systems, and security practices."}
