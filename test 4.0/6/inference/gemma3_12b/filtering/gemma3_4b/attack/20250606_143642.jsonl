{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events describes a malicious PowerShell script execution and cleanup. Here's a breakdown, focusing on the malicious actions and the context:\n\n**1. Initial Setup & Task Scheduler:**\n\n*   **`taskschd.dll` loading:**  Indicates that the script likely arrived through a scheduled task.  The `Image loaded` events show the `taskschd.dll` being loaded.\n*   **`powershell.exe` accessed via task scheduler:** A scheduled task initiated the PowerShell script.\n\n**2. Information Gathering and Anti-Analysis:**\n\n*   **`whoami.exe` Execution:** The script is gathering information about the user executing it. This is a standard technique for reconnaissance, to determine privileges and potential targets.\n*   **`powershell.exe` accesses & Registry events:** This shows PowerShell executing various commands and modifications to the registry.\n\n**3. Payload Delivery and Execution:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` & `Remove-Item`:** This is the core malicious action.  It's using PowerShell to delete a ZIP file from the temporary directory (`$env:Temp`). The purpose of this ZIP file is unclear from this log snippet, but it was likely the payload of the attacker.\n*   **`.NET` DLL Loading:**  The loading of `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll` etc. signifies that the PowerShell script is utilizing .NET functionality, expanding the attack possibilities.\n*   **Windows Defender DLL loading (MpOAV.dll):** While not inherently malicious on its own, its presence here suggests the script might be attempting to evade or interact with Windows Defender's platform.  The attacker might be trying to determine Defender's state or exploit a weakness.\n\n**4. Cleanup & Stealth:**\n\n*   **Temporary File Creation and Immediate Deletion:** The creation and immediate deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` in the user's temp directory is a classic cleanup technique.  The attacker aims to remove traces of the script's execution.  The `PSScriptPolicyTest` prefix suggests the script might have initially attempted a test of the PowerShell execution policy, and then proceeded with its malicious actions if successful.\n\n**Summary and Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **Scheduled Task:**  Malicious PowerShell scripts are frequently deployed through scheduled tasks.\n*   **`.NET` Dependencies:** Use of .NET libraries extends the potential for sophisticated attacks.\n*   **File Deletion in Temp Directory:**  An attempt to erase evidence of the script's presence.\n*   **PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass:** The \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" name in the temporary file indicates a possible attempt to bypass PowerShell execution policy restrictions.\n*   **Command-Line Argument (Remove-Item):**  The removal of a file suggests a payload delivery and execution strategy.\n\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Review Scheduled Tasks:**  Thoroughly examine all scheduled tasks for suspicious entries, especially those running PowerShell scripts.\n*   **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring of PowerShell execution.\n*   **Hone Execution Policies:** Tighten PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  Implement an EDR solution that can detect and block malicious PowerShell activity.\n*   **File Integrity Monitoring:**  Monitor critical system files and directories for unauthorized changes.\n*   **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):**  Establish a baseline of normal user behavior and look for deviations that may indicate compromise."}
