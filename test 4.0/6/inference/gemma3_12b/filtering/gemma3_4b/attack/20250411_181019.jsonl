This behavior is strongly indicative of potentially malicious activity, specifically likely an attempt at persistent execution, although the non-existent script paths might suggest a failed or incomplete attempt.  Furthermore, there's unusual DLL loading via `urlmon.dll` from `calc.exe` and `Calculator.exe`, which may be a method for code execution.
