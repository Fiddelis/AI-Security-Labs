Frequent network connections from Chrome, PowerShell and command execution, along with WMIC activity and registry modifications by various processes (cmd.exe, wmiprvse.exe, powershell.exe, notepad.exe, conhost.exe), raise concerns about potential reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or malware execution. The presence of urlmon.dll being loaded by WMIC and svchost is also noteworthy, as it can be indicative of exploitation attempts. Finally, the winlogbeat installation is a red flag.
