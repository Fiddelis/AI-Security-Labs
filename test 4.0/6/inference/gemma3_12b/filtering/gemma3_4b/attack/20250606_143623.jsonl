{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The logs indicate suspicious activity involving the creation and startup of a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. Here's a breakdown of the findings and potential implications:\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Service Creation:** A PowerShell script is used to create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\". This is a red flag because legitimate software rarely creates services this way.  The `-BinaryPathName` specifies the location of the executable (`tarefa_logico.exe`) that the service will run.\n*   **Unusual Path:** The path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` is highly suspicious. It's likely a custom path, not a standard Windows location, suggesting a potentially malicious actor deployed this executable.  The file names (\"unidade_logico,\" \"registro_comum,\" \"tarefa_logico\") are also not typical and suggest an attempt to evade detection.\n*   **PowerShell Execution:**  The use of PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is notable. While this attempts to restrict script execution, it's often bypassed by attackers.  The `Write-Host` command within the execution policy suggests a potential testing or confirmation step.\n*   **Repeated Actions:** The creation and startup sequence is repeated multiple times, indicating a process running on a loop, possibly attempting to ensure the service is running, or re-trying creation if it fails.\n*   **Engine Lifecycle Events:** Multiple events related to 'Engine Lifecycle' are observed, following the creation and startup of the new service. This might be a result of the new service interacting with other components.\n\n**Potential Threats and Implications:**\n\n*   **Malware Persistence:** The new service could be a mechanism for malware to persist on the system.  Even if the initial infection is removed, the service would restart, re-establishing the malicious activity.\n*   **Data Exfiltration:**  `tarefa_logico.exe` could be designed to steal sensitive data from the system and transmit it to an external server.\n*   **Remote Control:** The service could provide a backdoor for an attacker to remotely control the compromised machine.\n*   **System Compromise:**  The service could be used to perform other malicious activities, such as installing additional malware, modifying system settings, or disabling security features.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Isolation:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent the potential spread of malware.\n2.  **Malware Scan:** Perform a full system scan using updated antivirus and anti-malware software. However, be aware that custom malware may not be detected by standard tools.\n3.  **File Analysis:** Analyze the file `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` using a sandbox environment or reverse engineering techniques to understand its functionality.  Submit the file to a malware analysis service (e.g., VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis).\n4.  **Service Removal:**  If confirmed malicious, remove the newly created service \"objeto_ativo\" using the Services app (`services.msc`).  Also, delete the associated executable file.\n5.  **Registry Examination:** Carefully review the Windows Registry for any entries related to the service. This may involve searching for entries containing \"objeto_ativo\" or the path to the executable.\n6.  **Process Monitoring:**  Implement process monitoring and auditing to detect any future attempts to create or modify services.\n7.  **PowerShell Restrictions:** Review and strengthen PowerShell execution policies and restrict the use of PowerShell to authorized users and scripts.\n8.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Implement an EDR solution to proactively detect and respond to malicious activity on endpoints.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The analysis is based solely on the provided logs.  A thorough investigation is required to fully understand the scope of the compromise and the attacker's goals."}
