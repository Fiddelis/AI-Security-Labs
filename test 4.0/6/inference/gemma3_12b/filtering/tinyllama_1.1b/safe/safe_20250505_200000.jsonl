Frequent registry modifications (RegistryEvent rule) across multiple processes (svchost.exe, services.exe, DrvInst.exe, OpenWith.exe) indicate potential malicious activity. Image loads from urlmon.dll by multiple processes (WindowsCamera.exe, Microsoft.Photos.exe, SDXHelper.exe) are suspicious and could be related to DLL side-loading. The presence of 'Special Logon' events, alongside multiple 'Logon' events, could point to privilege escalation attempts.
