{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log sequence indicates a PowerShell script was executed, likely as part of an automated test.  Let's break down the significant events:\n\n**1. Initial PowerShell Execution & Core Libraries Load:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` is executed.** This marks the start of the script's run.\n*   **`.NET Framework Libraries Loaded:**  The script heavily relies on .NET Framework libraries (`mscoree.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`). The loading of these libraries is common for any PowerShell script utilizing .NET objects and functionalities.  This is expected behavior.\n\n**2. File Deletion:**\n\n*   **`File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)`:**  A file named `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` was deleted.  The name suggests a temporary script file created for a PowerShell policy test (likely bypass).  The deletion itself is noteworthy; it suggests the script is cleaning up after itself.  The `__PSScriptPolicyTest` part is a strong indicator of a test or bypass mechanism.\n\n**3. Script Execution and Result Output:**\n\n*   **`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`:** This indicates the script's primary goal was to output \"Final result: 1\". The initial script attempts a simple output (`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`) and later attempts a more complex logic.\n*   **Complex Logic Script:**  The more complex script iterates through INF files in the Windows `inf` directory and checks if a specific line containing `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]` exists.  If it's found, it sets `$Res = 1`; otherwise, `$Res` remains 0. The final value of `$Res` is then outputted to the console. This script likely aimed to detect the architecture or OS type based on INF file content.\n\n**Overall Interpretation and Potential Concerns:**\n\n*   **Script Policy Test:** The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` strongly suggests this is related to testing PowerShell's Execution Policy. The script likely attempts to bypass or circumvent restrictions.  This is the most concerning aspect.\n*   **Cleanup:** The deletion of the temporary script file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` suggests an attempt to hide evidence of the execution.\n*   **Architecture\/OS Detection:** The script checking for `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]` in INF files suggests an attempt to identify the system architecture or operating system version. This might be part of an exploitation attempt or for system profiling.\n*   **Potential for Malicious Activity:**  The combination of Execution Policy testing, cleanup, and system information gathering raises flags for potential malicious activity.  It's likely a script used for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or bypassing security controls.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Investigate the Source:**  Determine how this PowerShell script was executed. Was it a user-initiated action, a scheduled task, or a component of a larger application?\n2.  **Review Execution Policies:**  Examine your PowerShell Execution Policies to ensure they are configured to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n3.  **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement PowerShell logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity.\n4.  **Security Software:** Ensure antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are up-to-date and configured to detect PowerShell-based threats.\n5. **User Behavior:** Investigate user `fiddelis` and their recent activity.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A more thorough investigation, including reviewing the full script content and analyzing related events, would be necessary to confirm the nature and intent of this activity."}
