The consistent usage of unusual .exe names (e.g., pacote_padrao.exe, objeto_logico.exe) and .NET framework dependencies warrant further investigation. The winlogbeat installation and configuration also presents a potential avenue for data exfiltration or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
