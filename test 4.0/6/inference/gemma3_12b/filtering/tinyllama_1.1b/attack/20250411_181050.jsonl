This pattern suggests potential malicious activity such as obfuscation or the deployment of a payload. The presence of PowerShell activity further increases suspicion.  While other processes are benign, the combination of `certutil` and `cmd` behavior warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
