Specifically, multiple PowerShell processes are involved in loading numerous .dll files, potentially indicating a script being executed. The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script file (likely a bypass of PowerShell execution policy) followed by manipulation of file timestamps using PowerShell is highly suspicious.
