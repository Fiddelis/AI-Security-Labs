The repeated use of `certutil` coupled with temporary file creation and decoding suggests a possible attempt to execute malicious code.  The presence of `SDXHelper.exe` and repeated Chrome registry modifications add complexity and warrant further investigation.  While `winlogbeat` and `powershell` are common system processes, their combination with the other activities elevates the overall suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
