While these could be legitimate administrative tasks, the repeated attempts and unusual usernames ('modulo_geral_Admin', 'modulo_principal_Admin') warrant further investigation. Additionally, the presence of `powershell.exe` and numerous registry modifications by `chrome.exe` can be indicative of malicious behavior, although Chrome's activity is common and may be benign. The combination of these events elevates the overall risk.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
