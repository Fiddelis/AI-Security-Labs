The creation of a PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1`) also raises concern, potentially indicating the execution of malicious code.  The repeated Provider\/Engine Lifecycle events from PowerShell are also of interest.  The presence of `winlogbeat` activity is also noted, but is likely benign in isolation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
