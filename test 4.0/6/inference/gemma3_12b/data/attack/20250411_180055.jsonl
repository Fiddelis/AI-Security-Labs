While ZIP creation itself isn't malicious, the repeated use of PowerShell for archiving and the diverse file paths (containing terms like 'tarefa', 'pacote', 'modulo', 'objeto', 'registro', 'componente', 'elemento', 'unidade') suggest a potential data exfiltration or staging activity. The repeated use of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module further reinforces this suspicion.
