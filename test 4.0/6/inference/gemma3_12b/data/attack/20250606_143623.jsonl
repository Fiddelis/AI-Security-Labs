{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The log data indicates a series of events, primarily focused on process creation and service management. Here's a breakdown of the key observations, grouped by category, and with potential implications:\n\n**1. Initial Process Creation & Configuration:**\n\n* **`services.exe` Registry Change:**  This suggests a likely startup process or a configuration change within a Windows service.  The specific registry value altered is unknown, requiring further investigation.\n* **`sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Service) Image Loaded:** The loading of `taskschd.dll` by `sppsvc.exe` implies activity related to task scheduling or activation.\n* **`svchost.exe` Registry Change:** Another registry change by a critical system process (`svchost.exe`), indicative of configuration changes or potential system services adjustments.\n\n**2. PowerShell Script Execution (Critical & Suspicious):**\n\n* **Repetitive PowerShell Script (`powershell.exe`):**  This is the most significant element of the log. The script being executed is: `powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}`.  This script performs the following actions repeatedly:\n    * **Creates a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\"**:  The service's executable is located at `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This path and executable name are highly suspicious.\n    * **Starts the newly created service.**\n\n**3. Service Lifecycle Events:**\n\n*  Several log entries indicate a \"Provider Lifecycle,\" then \"Engine Lifecycle\"  relating to the \"objeto_ativo\" service.  This demonstrates the cycle of creation, start and runtime.\n\n**Key Concerns and Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n* **Obfuscation:** The use of a PowerShell script is a common technique for obfuscating malicious intent. It makes it more difficult to understand the script's purpose at a glance.\n* **Suspicious File Path:** The path  `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` is highly unusual and not typical for legitimate Windows software.  The naming conventions used (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`, `tarefa_logico`) are also suspicious and suggest a custom or potentially malicious component. *This is the biggest red flag.*\n* **Service Creation:** The creation of a new Windows service without authorization is a significant indicator of potential compromise. Malicious actors often create services to achieve persistence—meaning their code will run automatically even after a system reboot.\n* **Persistence:** The act of creating and automatically starting a service, as demonstrated by the PowerShell script, is a strong attempt at establishing persistence.\n* **Repetitive Execution:** The repeated execution of the PowerShell script strongly suggests an attempt to ensure the service creation and start are successful.\n* **Language:**  The presence of Portuguese in the file paths (e.g., \"unidade_logico,\" \"registro_comum\") implies that the attacker might be targeting a Portuguese-speaking region.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Immediate Action: Investigate `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`**:  This is the top priority. Quarantine and analyze the file in a sandbox environment to determine its functionality.  Check VirusTotal and other online scanners.\n2. **Disable the \"objeto_ativo\" Service**:  If the service has been created, immediately disable it to prevent it from running.\n3. **Review PowerShell Execution History**:  Examine the PowerShell execution history to identify other potentially malicious scripts that may have been run.  Use `Get-PSReadLineHistory` in PowerShell.\n4. **Examine Scheduled Tasks:**  Check the Task Scheduler to confirm if the PowerShell script is scheduled to run automatically.  If so, remove the scheduled task.\n5. **Scan the System:**  Perform a full system scan with an updated antivirus\/antimalware solution.\n6. **Check for Lateral Movement:**  Look for signs of lateral movement on the network (e.g., other systems with similar file paths or unusual service configurations).\n7. **Review System Logs:** Examine other system logs for any other unusual activity related to the identified process or user.\n8. **Investigate Origin:**  Determine how the `tarefa_logico.exe` file arrived on the system. Was it downloaded, copied from a USB drive, or installed through a legitimate software package?\n9. **Incident Response:**  If the system is determined to be compromised, follow your organization’s incident response plan.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A comprehensive investigation would require additional information and access to the affected system."}
