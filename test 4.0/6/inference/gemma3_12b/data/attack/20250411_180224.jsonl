The scripts reference non-existing files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which suggests an attempt to evade detection or potentially indicate a delayed execution of malicious code. The creation of a scheduled task named `win32times` and repeated registry modifications from `svchost.exe` further amplify suspicion. While a winlogbeat deployment is also present, the scheduled task creation and PowerShell execution stand out as suspicious behaviors.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
