{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events describes a malicious PowerShell script executing and attempting to remove itself from the system. Here's a breakdown and analysis:\n\n**Initial Setup & Task Scheduler:**\n\n1.  **`services.exe` and `svchost.exe`:**  These are normal Windows processes that are expected to be running. The registry changes associated with them are standard operations.\n2.  **`sppsvc.exe` & `taskschd.dll`:**  This suggests the script may have been initially executed via a scheduled task. `sppsvc.exe` is the Service Platform Provider Service (used for software licensing and running certain services) and `taskschd.dll` is the DLL for Task Scheduler. A scheduled task is often a method attackers use to ensure persistence or trigger malicious actions at a specific time.\n\n**The Malicious Payload (PowerShell):**\n\n3.  **`powershell.exe` (Initial Execution):** The attack chain is now focused on PowerShell.\n4.  **`whoami.exe`:** The `whoami` command is run, which is a standard tool to display user information. Its presence here is primarily used to get the user's identity in preparation for actions which may be needed.\n5.  **`powershell.exe` & `Remove-Item...` (Critical Action):**  This is the core malicious action.\n    *   The script uses `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` to delete a ZIP file located in the user's temporary directory. The name suggests the ZIP file may be a core part of the attack – possibly containing the main payload or other malicious components. The `-Force` parameter bypasses confirmation prompts, ensuring the deletion occurs automatically.\n6.  **`powershell.exe` & DLL Loads:** These lines describe PowerShell loading various .NET Framework DLLs to execute the delete command.  These DLLs are essential for PowerShell's operation, but their presence here highlights that a PowerShell script is running.\n7.  **`powershell.exe` & Policy Test File:** This is another concerning action. The script creates a temporary PowerShell script file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`. This is a common tactic to bypass PowerShell execution policies.  PowerShell uses these \"test\" files to determine if a system allows unsigned scripts to run. After the test, the file is immediately deleted.\n\n**Summary of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **Scheduled Task:** The initial steps strongly suggest a scheduled task was involved.  Look for suspicious entries in Task Scheduler.\n*   **Temporary File Deletion:** The `Remove-Item` command deleting a file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temp directory is a key indicator. The attacker wants to remove traces of their operation.\n*   **PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass:** The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell policy test file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) suggests an attempt to bypass execution policies.\n*   **Unusual PowerShell Activity:** Any PowerShell script activity deleting files is highly suspect and needs further investigation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Inspect Task Scheduler:** Thoroughly examine Task Scheduler for any suspicious scheduled tasks, especially those with unusual triggers or hidden names.\n2.  **Analyze PowerShell History:** Review PowerShell history logs for more details about the script’s execution.\n3.  **Check Temporary Directory:**  Examine the user's temp directory (usually `C:\\\\Users\\\\<username>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`) for any other unusual files that may have been left behind.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Ensure PowerShell execution policies are properly configured to prevent the execution of unsigned scripts.  Ideally, execution policies should be set to `Restricted` or `AllSigned`.\n5.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Utilize EDR tools to monitor PowerShell activity and detect suspicious behavior.\n6.  **Scan for Malware:** Run a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software.\n7. **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs for PowerShell-related events."}
