The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's a process creation of cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a service called win32times. The binPath points to a PowerShell script that's trying to start a non-existing script, c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. That's a red flag because creating a service that runs a non-existent script might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. Also, the command line uses sc create and sc qc, which are commands related to managing services. That's unusual for normal operations.\n\nNext, there's a process access event for powershell.exe. Not immediately suspicious on its own, but combined with other events might indicate something. Then another sc.exe process creating the same service win32times again, with a different script path: c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the script doesn't exist. This repetition of creating a service with non-existent scripts is concerning. It could be part of an attack where the attacker is trying to execute code through the service, but the scripts are missing, possibly to avoid detection or because they're being executed in memory.\n\nThen there are events related to services.exe modifying the registry. Changing registry values might be part of persistence mechanisms, like altering startup entries or other configurations. The same event occurs twice, which could indicate multiple changes or a repeated attempt.\n\nThere's also an image load event for calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator.exe is a legitimate process, but loading urlmon.dll is normal. However, the presence of both calc.exe and Calculator.exe (note the capitalization difference) might be a typo or an attempt to mimic a legitimate process. The capitalization could be a red herring, but it's worth noting.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a file, which seems normal as part of its operation. The other events involving chrome.exe are registry changes and image loads. Loading amsi.dll is normal, as AMSI is part of Windows' anti-malware system. However, multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might be part of an attack trying to disable AMSI or other security features, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious points are the creation of services with non-existent scripts, which could be an attempt to execute malicious code through the service. The repeated use of sc.exe and the registry modifications by services.exe suggest possible persistence mechanisms. The presence of non-existent scripts might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute payloads in memory, avoiding leaving files on disk. The combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity, even if some parts are not immediately obvious. However, there are also legitimate processes here, so it's not a clear-cut case. But given the service creation with non-existent scripts and the registry changes, I think this is worth investigating further. So the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events involving service creation with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), repeated use of 'sc.exe' to manipulate services, and registry modifications by 'services.exe' suggest potential malicious activity. These patterns are commonly associated with persistence mechanisms and command-line-based attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
