The first event is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a normal Windows utility that displays user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a 'powershell.exe' process running a command that uses 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for the word 'password' in various file types. This command is looking through files like XML, DOC, TXT, and XLS in the current directory and subdirectories. The fact that it's searching for passwords might be a red flag, but it could also be a legitimate search if someone is trying to find credentials.\n\nNext, there are several entries about 'powershell.exe' with tasks like 'Process accessed', 'Image loaded', and 'File created' and 'File Delete logged'. The file created is a temporary PowerShell script, which is then deleted. This could be part of a normal script execution, but the creation and deletion of temporary files might be something to watch. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times in 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events. This repetition might indicate that the process is being monitored or logged multiple times, but again, it could be normal logging behavior.\n\nThere's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a new YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal. The 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' entries are probably the same process (calc.exe is the Windows calculator), loading 'urlmon.dll', which is a standard DLL for URL handling. The 'svchost.exe' entries about registry value sets are also typical for system services.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious part is the PowerShell command searching for passwords. However, without seeing the context of why that search is happening, or if there's any other unusual activity, it's hard to determine if it's malicious. The rest of the events seem to be normal system processes and log entries. The repetition of the same PowerShell command might be benign if it's part of a legitimate script, but it could also be part of a larger attack. However, based solely on the provided logs, there's not enough evidence to classify this as definitely interesting. The confidence is moderate, but leaning towards not interesting unless there's more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances are executing commands to search for 'password' in files, which could indicate credential harvesting.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through each event to spot anything suspicious.\n\nThe first entry is OfficeClickToRun.exe with a DNS query. That's a legitimate Microsoft process, so probably not an issue. Then there's a PowerShell command that searches for passwords in files. That seems a bit fishy. The command uses findstr and select-string to look for 'password' in various file types. Maybe someone is trying to find credentials on the system.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Not sure if that's normal, but maybe part of a script. Then several Chrome.exe events: DNS queries, registry changes, and loading DLLs. The DLLs mentioned are amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. Loading those is normal, so probably not malicious.\n\nThere's a network connection detected for Chrome, which is standard. Then a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of legitimate monitoring. However, the .yml.new file could be a configuration being written, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe command, which just shows user info. Not suspicious. The cmd.exe commands are deleting scheduled tasks with specific names. That's interesting because deleting tasks could be part of removing malicious tasks, but it could also be part of covering tracks. The names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" don't ring a bell, but maybe they're custom.\n\nThere are multiple PowerShell processes being accessed and created. The WMIC.exe command is deleting notepad.exe processes. That's odd because deleting processes can be a sign of malware trying to remove itself or other malicious processes.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell command searching for passwords, the deletion of scheduled tasks, and the WMIC command deleting processes might indicate someone is trying to find credentials and clean up traces. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate activities, like a script that's searching for passwords in files for security purposes or managing tasks. But the combination of these events, especially the password search and process deletions, raises a red flag. It's not conclusive, but there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. So the classification should be INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell command searching for passwords in files, deletion of scheduled tasks with obscure names, and WMIC process deletion.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event stands out because it's WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path seems a bit suspicious because Windows Defender's files are usually in specific locations, and loading a DLL from there might indicate something malicious, like a dropper or a compromise.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances of cmd.exe and net.exe commands deleting user accounts. Commands like \"net user \/del\" are often used in attacks to remove user accounts, possibly to cover tracks or disable admin accounts. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" could be a red flag, as it might be a malicious variant.\n\nThere's also a \"sc delete win32times\" command, which deletes a service. This could be part of removing a malicious service or a legitimate one if the service is compromised. The repeated use of \"powershell.exe\" with \"Process accessed\" events might indicate that PowerShell is being used for further actions, which is common in attacks.\n\nThe \"cmd.exe\" processes running commands to delete temporary files might be trying to clean up after malicious activities. The presence of multiple registry events could suggest changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, some entries are just normal processes like whoami.exe, which is common. But the combination of these events—loading a suspicious DLL, deleting user accounts, deleting services, and using PowerShell—points towards a potential security incident. The confidence is high, but not 100%, because some logs might be part of legitimate activities, but the overall pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: WMIC loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory (potential dropper), repeated user account deletions via 'net.exe'\/'net1.exe', service deletion ('sc delete'), and PowerShell process access events.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first event is a File Delete logged by the rule FileDeleteDetected, involving the deletion of a file named tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe in the Temp directory. That seems suspicious because deleting a file in Temp might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are multiple Process Create events for powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami.exe is a legitimate tool that shows user context, but if it's being run repeatedly, that might not be normal. The command lines for whoami.exe are straightforward, but the frequent creation of PowerShell processes could be a red flag. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands.\n\nLooking at the Image Load events, PowerShell is loading several DLLs, some of which are from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute malicious code, possibly through injection or other techniques.\n\nThere's also a File Create event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, which is then deleted. Creating and deleting temporary files is common, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of an attack chain. The fact that PowerShell is involved in both creating and deleting these files could be indicative of an attempt to execute scripts without leaving traces.\n\nHowever, there are also events that seem benign, like the whoami.exe executions. But the high frequency of PowerShell events and the specific file operations might be more indicative of malicious activity. The classification here is tricky because some events are normal, but the combination of PowerShell usage, file creation\/deletion, and multiple process creations could point to a potential security incident.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of multiple suspicious activities related to PowerShell and file operations in the Temp directory might be enough to classify this as INTERESTING. The confidence isn't 100% because some events are normal, but the combination does raise concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process creations, file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, and image loading events involving potential malicious artifacts (e.g., decoded.exe) suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I should look at each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first two entries, both mention 'Image loaded' with 'urlmon.dll'. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, part of the URL Moniker, used for handling URLs. But the process names here are 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe'. Hmm, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. Normally, it's 'calc.exe' for the calculator. Maybe that's a typo or a renamed process. But even so, loading urlmon.dll is normal for some operations. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nNext, there's an entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs. Creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation when setting up. But maybe the path is unusual? The user is 'fiddelis', which might be a username, but not sure if that's relevant. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' with a 'Process accessed' event. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but it's also a normal admin tool. Without more context, like command-line arguments or unusual behavior, it's hard to tell. The file is 'None', so maybe the event is about the process itself, not accessing a file.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are about DNS queries and network connections. Chrome doing DNS lookups and connecting to the internet is normal. There are two entries each for DNS and network connect, but that's typical for a browser. Unless there are unusual domains or IPs involved, but the logs don't mention that.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two entries might be normal, but the 'Calculator.exe' name is odd. The winlogbeat file creation seems legitimate. PowerShell access could be normal. Chrome's activities are expected. However, there's no clear malicious activity here. The events don't show any obvious signs of compromise, like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or suspicious network activity. Maybe the presence of 'Calculator.exe' is a red flag, but without more data, it's hard to confirm. The confidence is low, so I'd classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (calc.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe) and standard system behaviors (image loading, DNS queries, file creation).
