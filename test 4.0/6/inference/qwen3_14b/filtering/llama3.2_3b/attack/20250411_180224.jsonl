Let me go through each line.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries related to schtasks.exe and cmd.exe. The first event shows a process create for cmd.exe with a command line that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The task is set to run daily under the system account, and the trigger is a PowerShell script that's supposed to run. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That might be a red flag because if the script doesn't exist, maybe that's part of an attack, like trying to execute a non-existent file to bypass detection. But maybe it's a typo? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's another event for schtasks.exe creating the same kind of task, with a different script name: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, \"NonExistingScript\" in the filename. That seems suspicious. Scheduled tasks running PowerShell scripts with bypassed execution policies might be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nOther events include image loaded for schtasks.exe, which is normal since it's a legitimate Windows tool. But the repeated use of schtasks to create tasks with non-existent scripts is concerning. Also, there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign but could be part of checking privileges. \n\nThere are also file creation events for winlogbeat and some text files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating its config files might be normal if it's being installed. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes might indicate configuration changes. The chrome.exe entries with registry value sets might be unrelated, but if there's a lot of them, could be part of something else. \n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious part is the creation of scheduled tasks using schtasks with non-existent PowerShell scripts. Even if the scripts don't exist, the act of creating such tasks under the system account with daily execution could be an attempt to establish persistence. The filenames with \"NonExisting\" might be a clue that the attacker is trying to hide the actual script name or is part of a larger plan where the script is elsewhere. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any other benign activity. The whoami.exe and schtasks.exe are legitimate, but the command lines here are crafted to run PowerShell with bypassed execution policy, which is often used in attacks. Also, the fact that the tasks are created with \/ru system (running as system) is a high-privilege action, which is unusual unless it's part of a legitimate administrative task. \n\nThe confidence here is medium to high. The combination of creating scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts, using bypassed execution policy, and running under system account points to potential malicious activity. However, without more context, it's possible that this is a false positive or part of a legitimate process. But given the indicators, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled task creations using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), which may indicate attempted persistence or evasion techniques. The tasks are configured to run daily under the SYSTEM account, a high-risk indicator.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
