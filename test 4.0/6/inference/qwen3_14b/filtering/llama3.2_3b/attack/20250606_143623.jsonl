So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple File created events under the setup.exe process. The files are being created in the Microsoft EdgeCore and Edge directories. Some of the files are like show_third_party_software_licenses.bat, Installer\\setup.exe, msedge.exe, msedge_proxy.exe, and pwahelper.exe. Wait, msedge.exe and others are legitimate Edge components, but why is setup.exe creating them? Also, the paths are in Program Files, which is normal, but maybe the presence of setup.exe doing this is suspicious. However, setup.exe could be part of a legitimate installation.\n\nThen there are Registry value set events from svchost.exe and services.exe. svchost.exe is a common system process, but if it's modifying the registry, that's normal too. However, multiple registry changes might be a red flag if they're not part of a known process. But in this case, the logs don't specify what registry keys are being modified, so it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe entries, there are several files created in the Windows Temp directory with APPX temporary files. That's typical during Windows updates or installations, so maybe that's normal. However, the AppReadiness directory entry might be related to system readiness checks, which could be part of a legitimate process.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe event with the command line \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'\". The ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which is the default and blocks scripts from running. The command itself is harmless, just outputting text. But why is PowerShell being used here? It might be part of a test or a legitimate script, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The setup.exe process is creating multiple files, some of which are legitimate Edge components. However, setup.exe is often associated with installations. The registry changes and file creations in temp directories could be part of an installation process. The PowerShell command seems benign. But the combination of multiple file creations and registry changes by setup.exe and svchost.exe might indicate an installation or update. However, if these events are part of a legitimate Microsoft Edge update, they might not be malicious. But if setup.exe is not part of a known legitimate installer, that's suspicious. The presence of multiple registry modifications and file creations could be a sign of a malicious installation, but without more context like the source of setup.exe or any network activity, it's hard to confirm. However, the fact that some files are in the Edge directory and others are in temp might be normal. The confidence here is moderate because while there are multiple events, they could be part of a legitimate process. But the repeated registry changes and file creations by setup.exe might warrant further investigation. So, the classification might be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'setup.exe' process events creating files in Microsoft Edge directories and modifying registry values, which may indicate an installation or tampering.

First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various actions like image loaded, file created, and process access. There are several instances where PowerShell is loading DLLs from system directories like C:\\Windows\\System32 and C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but I should check if any of these DLLs are unusual. For example, the paths mentioned are standard for .NET frameworks, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_... These could be temporary files created by PowerShell scripts. Not necessarily malicious, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event shows a process creation for whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to get user info. The cmd.exe event is running a DISM command to disable Windows Defender. That's suspicious because disabling security features is a common tactic for attackers. The command line uses DISM with the \/Disable-Feature and \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender. If this is done by an authorized user, maybe it's part of a system change, but if not, it's a red flag.\n\nThen there are events related to Dism.exe detecting executable files in the Temp directory. The files AssocProvider.dll and DismCorePS.dll are in a temporary folder. This could be part of a legitimate DISM operation, but if these files are not expected, it might indicate something malicious. However, DISM can sometimes download files temporarily, so it's not definitive.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell command line in one of the events: it's checking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. That seems like a script to look for certain configurations, but without knowing the intent, it's hard to assess. The execution policy is set to Restricted, which might prevent scripts from running, but the command is still executing.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the DISM command disabling Windows Defender. That's a significant security change. However, the rest of the events could be part of normal operations or benign scripts. But since there's a mix of normal system files and the disabling of a security feature, this might warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't extremely high, but enough to classify as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities involving image loading from system directories, file creation in temp folders, and a DISM command attempting to disable Windows Defender.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are related to the Dism.exe process, which I know is part of the Windows Deployment Imaging Service and Management Technology. It's commonly used for tasks like deploying and managing Windows images. \n\nThe first event mentions a file created called DismHost.exe in the Temp directory. The subsequent events all indicate that various DLL files (like DismProv.dll, AssocProvider.dll.mui, etc.) have been detected as executable. These files are in the en-US subdirectory under the Temp folder.\n\nNow, Dism.exe typically uses these DLLs as part of its normal operations, especially during image deployment or system preparation. However, the fact that multiple executable files are being created in the Temp directory might be a red flag. Usually, legitimate DLLs are part of the system's installation media or official packages. But if these files are being generated in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files, it could indicate that something is trying to execute code that shouldn't be there.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is whether these events are normal or suspicious. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, but creating multiple executable files in the Temp directory might be unusual. However, I should consider that during certain operations, like sysprep or image deployment, Dism might generate temporary files. But the presence of multiple DLLs with .mui extensions (which are typically language-specific resources) being marked as executable might be a sign of something wrong. \n\nAnother point is the naming of the files. For example, DismProv.dll is a real component, but if it's being created in the Temp directory by Dism.exe, that's not standard. Normally, these files would be part of the system's installation or in the system directory, not in Temp. Also, the fact that all these files are being created under the same GUID folder (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89) might be a sign of a specific operation, but it's not clear if that's legitimate.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that the detection of these files as executable might be part of the normal process. For example, when using DISM, it might extract necessary components temporarily. But the fact that all these events are under the same parent directory and involve multiple DLLs could still be suspicious. \n\nIn conclusion, while some of these activities might be normal during certain operations, the concentration of executable files in the Temp directory by Dism.exe could indicate a potential security issue, such as a malicious payload being executed under the guise of legitimate process. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting and warrants investigation**, though not definitively malicious. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process, Unusual Behavior:**\n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a legitimate Windows tool used for managing Windows images, but its interaction with **temporary files** in the `%TEMP%` directory raises questions. While DISM may temporarily extract files during operations like sysprep or image deployment, **generating multiple executable `.dll` and `.mui` files in the Temp directory** is **not standard behavior**.\n\n2. **File Naming and Location:**\n   - Files like **`DismProv.dll`**, **`AssocProvider.dll.mui`**, and others are **real components** of Windows, but they are typically **pre-installed in system directories** (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`) or part of official installation media. Their **creation in a Temp directory** under a randomly generated GUID folder (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) is **unusual** and could indicate:\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., a dropper or payload staged in Temp).\n     - **Misconfiguration** or **unintended behavior** during a legitimate DISM operation.\n\n3. **Relevance of `.mui` Files:**\n   - `.mui` files are **language-specific resource files** (e.g., for localization). While they are not executable, their **detection as executable** by the system (e.g., via file type or heuristic analysis) could signal **tampering** or **malicious repurposing** of legitimate files.\n\n4. **Volume of Events:**\n   - The **repeated detection of executable files** under the same parent directory suggests a **coordinated action**, which is more characteristic of **malicious activity** (e.g., staged components for execution) than typical system behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations:**\n- **Legitimate Use Case:** \n  - If the user is performing a **custom DISM operation** (e.g., modifying a WIM image), temporary files might be generated. However, **generating `.dll` and `.mui` files in Temp** would still be atypical for such tasks.\n  \n- **Malicious Activity:**\n  - The **creation of executable files in Temp** by `Dism.exe` could be a **red flag** for **malware** leveraging the legitimacy of `Dism.exe` to execute payloads or stage components.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Temp Directory:**\n   - Check the contents of the folder `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89` for any suspicious files (e.g., obfuscated executables, unusual hashes).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Procmon** to trace how `Dism.exe` interacts with these files.\n\n2. **Check for Anomalies in DISM Usage:**\n   - Verify if the user is running **unusual DISM commands** (e.g., `DISM \/Apply-Image` or `DISM \/Unmount-Image`) that might justify temporary file creation.\n\n3. **Malware Scan:**\n   - Perform a **full system scan** using updated antivirus tools to rule out malware.\n\n4. **Monitor for Persistence:**\n   - Look for **unusual registry entries**, **scheduled tasks**, or **service configurations** that might tie back to these files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **`Dism.exe` is a legitimate process**, the **unusual generation of executable files in the Temp directory** and the **volume of events** suggest **potential malicious activity**. This warrants further investigation to confirm whether the behavior is benign or indicative of compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are all about processes and files related to Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. \n\nFirst, looking at the events, there's a lot of \"File Executable Detected\" alerts from Dism.exe. The files are in the Temp directory under a specific folder with a long GUID. The filenames include things like TransmogProvider.dll.mui, VhdProvider.dll.mui, and others. Then there's a Process Create event for DismHost.exe with a command line that includes the same GUID. Also, Image Load events for DismHost.exe and DismCorePS.dll from the same Temp directory.\n\nHmm. Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. But why so many files being detected in the Temp folder? Usually, temporary files are normal, but when there's a lot of them, especially with names that look like they could be part of a malicious payload, that's suspicious. The GUID in the path might be a common pattern for malware to hide files, making them harder to detect. \n\nThe fact that DismHost.exe is being created and loading DLLs from the same Temp directory could indicate that something is trying to execute code from there. However, DismHost.exe is also a legitimate process. But if it's being spawned with a command line that includes a GUID, that might be part of a malicious process. Also, the Image Load events for DLLs from the Temp directory could be a red flag. Legitimate processes sometimes load DLLs from temporary directories, but combined with the other events, it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the files are being detected as executables. MUI files are usually language-specific resource files, not executables. So maybe the system is flagging them incorrectly, or perhaps they're being used in a way that's not standard. Also, the presence of DismCorePS.dll being loaded from the Temp directory could be a sign that a malicious DLL is being injected into a legitimate process. \n\nAnother angle: the command line for DismHost.exe includes a GUID, which might be a unique identifier for a specific operation. But if this is part of a malicious activity, the GUID could be part of the attack's signature. The repetition of the same GUID in multiple file paths suggests that these files are related. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these could be false positives. For example, during system updates or imaging processes, Dism might generate a lot of temporary files. But the number of events here seems high, and the specific naming of the files might not be typical. \n\nPutting it all together: the combination of multiple File Executable Detected events in the Temp directory, the use of a GUID in the path, and the loading of DLLs from the same location by DismHost.exe could indicate a potential security threat. Even though some processes are legitimate, the unusual patterns here might warrant further investigation. So the answer is probably that this is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, as they may indicate potential malicious activity, despite some components being associated with legitimate Windows processes. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual File Activity in Temp Directory:**\n   - Multiple **\"File Executable Detected\"** events involve **`Dism.exe`** loading files from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\`), including files like `TransmogProvider.dll.mui`, `VhdProvider.dll`, and others. \n   - **`.mui` files** are typically **language-specific resource files**, not executable code. Their detection as \"executable\" by the system may indicate **misclassification** or **tampering** (e.g., malicious payloads disguised as `.mui` files).\n\n2. **Suspicious Process and Image Load Events:**\n   - A **`DismHost.exe`** process is created with a command line containing the same GUID (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) and a unique identifier (`{3ED660F2-D9DD-43D4-B3AD-3464234FFF3A}`), which could be part of a **malicious operation** or **custom tooling**.\n   - **Image Load** events for `DismHost.exe` and `DismCorePS.dll` from the same Temp directory suggest **dynamic code loading**. While `DismCorePS.dll` is a legitimate component, its loading from a **non-standard location** (Temp directory) raises concerns about **DLL hijacking** or **malware injection**.\n\n3. **GUID in File Paths:**\n   - The use of a **GUID in the file path** (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) is a common tactic in malware to **obfuscate file names** and evade detection. This pattern is **highly suspicious** and inconsistent with typical Windows imaging or deployment operations.\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- **Lateral Movement or Persistence:** The Temp directory is often used by malware to store transient files. The repeated use of the same GUID across files and processes may indicate **coordinated malicious activity**.\n- **Legitimate Tools Misused:** While `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe` are legitimate, their behavior here (e.g., loading non-standard DLLs from Temp) deviates from normal operations and could indicate **tool abuse**.\n- **Potential for DLL Hijacking:** Loading `DismCorePS.dll` from a Temp directory instead of a trusted system path (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`) suggests **possible tampering** or **malicious DLL injection**.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Check File Integrity:** Verify the hashes of files in the Temp directory (e.g., `DismCorePS.dll`, `DismHost.exe`) against known good hashes or use antivirus tools to scan for malware.\n- **Monitor for Anomalies:** Investigate if the GUID (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) appears in other logs or network traffic.\n- **Review System Context:** Determine if the system is undergoing imaging\/deployment (which might explain the activity) or if the behavior is out of context (e.g., during normal operation).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe combination of **unusual file paths**, **GUID obfuscation**, **non-standard DLL loading**, and **repeated use of the same identifier** strongly suggests this warrants **further forensic analysis** to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where DismHost.exe is loading various DLL files from the Temp directory. The paths all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\. That GUID in the path might be a temporary directory created for some process. But why so many DLLs being loaded? Typically, DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM), which is used for Windows image management. However, loading multiple DLLs from the Temp folder could be suspicious, especially if they are not standard components.\n\nThen, there's an event where DismHost.exe terminates. After that, Dism.exe starts deleting files from the same Temp directory. The files being deleted include some DLLs and their MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files. Now, DISM might legitimately create and delete temporary files during operations, but the combination of loading many DLLs and then deleting them could indicate something malicious. \n\nWait, but why would Dism.exe delete those files? If this is part of a normal DISM operation, maybe the temporary files are cleaned up after use. However, the fact that the same GUID is used in the path might suggest that this is part of a specific process. But the presence of multiple DLLs being loaded by DismHost.exe could be a sign of code injection or a malicious payload being loaded into a legitimate process. \n\nAlso, the fact that the files are being deleted after the process terminates might be an attempt to cover tracks. However, it's also possible that this is just standard cleanup. But in security contexts, unexpected file deletions, especially after a process has finished, can be a red flag. \n\nAnother point is that Dism.exe is deleting files that were used by DismHost.exe. This could be part of a normal workflow, but if the files were not supposed to be there in the first place, that's a problem. For example, if the DLLs are not part of the standard DISM distribution, they might be malicious. \n\nI should check if these DLLs are known good files. However, without access to a database or reputation system, I can't confirm that. But the fact that they're all in the Temp directory and being deleted after use is suspicious. Legitimate processes usually don't load so many DLLs from Temp, especially if they are not part of the same application. \n\nMoreover, the sequence of events: loading multiple DLLs, then terminating the process, followed by deletion of those files. This pattern is sometimes seen in malware that uses temporary files to execute code and then cleans up. However, it's also possible that this is a legitimate operation, like a software installation or update that uses DISM. \n\nBut given that the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I should lean towards it being suspicious. The key indicators are the high number of DLLs loaded from Temp, followed by deletion. This could be a sign of a malicious process masquerading as DISM. \n\nHowever, I need to be cautious not to assume malice without more evidence. But in the context of a security analysis, this behavior would warrant further investigation. The presence of multiple DLLs and the cleanup could be an attempt to avoid detection. Therefore, the answer should indicate that this is interesting and requires more analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe sequence of events in this log warrants further investigation due to several suspicious patterns that deviate from typical legitimate behavior associated with DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool):\n\n### Key Indicators of Suspicion:\n1. **Unusual Volume of DLL Loads from Temp Directory**:\n   - **DismHost.exe** loads **10+ DLLs** (e.g., `CbsProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`, etc.) from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). \n   - While DISM may use temporary files, **loading this many DLLs** from a user-specific temp directory is atypical. Legitimate processes usually load fewer, well-known DLLs, and not from a directory tied to a specific user session.\n\n2. **Post-Execution File Deletion**:\n   - **Dism.exe** deletes the same DLLs and their MUI (language-specific) files immediately after the process terminates. \n   - This **cleanup behavior** could indicate an attempt to erase evidence of transient or malicious activity. Legitimate tools often do not delete files post-execution unless explicitly designed to do so (e.g., self-extracting archives).\n\n3. **Inconsistent Process Behavior**:\n   - **DismHost.exe** (a child process of DISM) is both **loading external DLLs** and **terminating abruptly**, followed by **Dism.exe** deleting the files. This suggests a potential **process chain** where a malicious actor might be leveraging DISM as a legitimate entry point to execute arbitrary code (e.g., **DLL injection** or **process hollowing**).\n\n4. **GUID-Stamped Temp Directory**:\n   - The use of a **unique GUID** in the temp directory path (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) is common in malware to avoid detection. While legitimate tools may use GUIDs, the **combination with file deletion** raises concerns.\n\n### Possible Explanations:\n- **Legitimate Use Case**: If this is part of a **custom DISM script** or **Windows image deployment**, the behavior might be intentional. However, such scenarios typically involve **explicit user input** or **documented workflows**.\n- **Malicious Activity**: The pattern aligns with **malware** that:\n  - Uses **legitimate processes** (e.g., DISM) as a **pivot point** to execute payloads.\n  - Loads **custom DLLs** from temp directories to avoid detection.\n  - Deletes files post-execution to **cover tracks**.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and should be investigated further. Steps to take:\n1. **Analyze the DLLs**: Check if the deleted DLLs (e.g., `CbsProvider.dll`, `DismCore.dll`) are **signed**, **known good**, or **malicious** (e.g., via reputation databases or static analysis).\n2. **Monitor Parent Processes**: Verify if **Dism.exe** was initiated by a **legitimate user action** (e.g., Windows Update, System Image deployment) or an **unusual source** (e.g., remote execution, suspicious scripts).\n3. **Check for Anomalies**: Look for other logs or system behavior (e.g., network connections, registry changes) that could tie this activity to **malware** or **compromise**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile not conclusive proof of malicious intent, the **unusual volume of DLL loads**, **post-execution cleanup**, and **GUID-based temp directory** strongly suggest this requires **closer scrutiny**. It is **interesting from a security perspective** and could indicate a **zero-day exploit**, **malware**, or **misconfigured tool**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all from the Dism.exe process, and each one is logging a file delete event. The files being deleted are all in the Temp directory under a specific user's AppData folder. The filenames have a pattern: they end with .dll.mui, which are usually Microsoft UI files. \n\nHmm, Dism.exe is part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment tool, right? It's typically used for things like deploying Windows images, applying updates, etc. So, if Dism is deleting these files, maybe it's part of a normal cleanup process. But wait, the user is fiddelis, and the Temp directory is often used for temporary files. However, the fact that so many files are being deleted by Dism might be a red flag. \n\nI should check if this is a normal operation. Sometimes, during system updates or deployments, Dism might delete old files. But the number of deletions here is quite high—15 files. That's a lot. Also, the filenames have a consistent structure with the same GUID in the path. That GUID might be related to a specific deployment or installation task. However, if this is part of a legitimate process, the system might not flag it. \n\nBut wait, could this be a sign of malware? Some malware uses legitimate processes to delete files, making it harder to detect. However, Dism.exe is a legitimate process. Still, the sheer number of files being deleted might be unusual. However, without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to say. \n\nThe justification here is that multiple files are being deleted by Dism.exe, which is a legitimate tool, but the high volume and specific pattern might indicate a cleanup or a potential malicious activity. However, since all the files are in the Temp directory and the process is Dism, which is known to handle such operations, it might be a false positive. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERMEDIATE\" because it's not obviously malicious, but it's also not a typical operation.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, mostly from Windows logs. They mentioned that their system is being infected with malware via PowerShell, and they want to know how to prevent it. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the data. The logs include entries with \"winlog\" indicating tasks like \"Process Create\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\". The process entries have command lines using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" and start it. The binary path points to an executable in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". \n\nHmm, creating a service via PowerShell is a common method for malware to persist. The fact that the service is named \"objeto_ativo\" might be a red herring, but the path seems suspicious. The directory \"unidade_logico\" translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese, which might be part of a naming convention, but the presence of \"registro_comum\" (common register) and \"entrada_base\" (base entry) could be indicative of some legitimate software, but I'm not sure.\n\nNext, the user is asking for prevention methods. So, I need to think about best practices for securing PowerShell usage and preventing unauthorized service creation. \n\nFirst, PowerShell execution policies are crucial. If the execution policy is set to RemoteSigned or AllSigned, scripts from the internet would need to be signed, which could prevent unsigned scripts from running. But if it's set to Bypass, that's a problem. The user should check their execution policy and set it to a more restrictive setting if necessary.\n\nThen, there's the use of AppLocker or Software Restriction Policies to control which scripts can run. These can block unauthorized executables or scripts from running, even if they're signed. That could prevent the malicious PowerShell command from executing.\n\nAlso, monitoring for unusual service creation is important. Using tools like Microsoft Defender, Sysmon, or other SIEM systems to alert on new service creation, especially from PowerShell. The logs here mention \"Process Create\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks, so monitoring those events could help detect such activities.\n\nAnother point is the use of least privilege. If the user account running the PowerShell command doesn't have administrative privileges, the service creation might be blocked. So, ensuring that users don't have unnecessary permissions can help mitigate the risk.\n\nAdditionally, the PowerShell command itself is using \"New-Service\" and \"Start-Service\". Maybe the user can block specific commands or use PowerShell logging to track such activities. Enabling script block logging and transcript logging could help in auditing.\n\nI should also mention checking for the presence of the executable in the specified path. If that file is not a legitimate part of the system, it might be malware. The user should verify the file's digital signature, check its hash against known good databases, and run antivirus scans.\n\nLastly, educating users about the risks of running untrusted PowerShell scripts and ensuring that they don't execute commands from unverified sources is important. Maybe the user is clicking on malicious links or downloading scripts from the internet.\n\nPutting this all together, the answer should outline steps like checking execution policies, using AppLocker, monitoring service creation, least privilege, verifying the file, and user education.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs you provided indicate a PowerShell script creating and starting a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This is a **classic malware persistence technique**. Below are steps to **prevent and detect such attacks**, along with analysis of the threat:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Analyze the Threat**\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - **Service Creation**: The script uses `New-Service` to create a new service, which is a common method for malware to persist across reboots.\n  - **Binary Path**: The executable `tarefa_logico.exe` is located in a non-standard directory (`C:\\unidade_logico\\...`), which may indicate a malicious file or a legitimate file being abused.\n  - **Execution via PowerShell**: PowerShell is often used by attackers for obfuscation and execution of malicious code.\n\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n  - **File Path**: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`\n  - **Service Name**: \"objeto_ativo\" (possibly a red herring, but could be a legitimate service if the file is valid).\n  - **Command Line**: `powershell.exe & {New-Service ...; Start-Service ...}`\n\n---\n\n### **2. Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**\n\n#### **A. Restrict PowerShell Usage**\n- **Set Execution Policy**:\n  - Use **RemoteSigned** or **AllSigned** to prevent unsigned scripts from running:\n    ```powershell\n    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n    ```\n  - Avoid using **Bypass** unless explicitly required.\n\n- **Disable Script Block Logging** (if not needed):\n  - Script block logging can be exploited by attackers to log malicious commands. Disable it if not required:\n    ```powershell\n    Set-Item -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ScriptBlockLogging\" -Value 0\n    ```\n\n#### **B. Use Host-Based Security Controls**\n- **AppLocker or Software Restriction Policies**:\n  - Create rules to block unauthorized executables or scripts (e.g., block PowerShell scripts from running in non-allowed directories).\n  - Example: Block execution of scripts in `C:\\unidade_logico\\...` unless signed by a trusted publisher.\n\n- **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)**:\n  - Use WDAC to allow only signed binaries to execute, preventing unsigned malware from running.\n\n#### **C. Monitor for Unusual Activity**\n- **Enable Sysmon** (System Monitor):\n  - Monitor for:\n    - **Process Creation** (Event ID 4688) with `powershell.exe` as the parent process.\n    - **Service Creation** (Event ID 4697) for new services (e.g., \"objeto_ativo\").\n    - **File Creation** (Event ID 10**): Track creation of files in suspicious directories.\n  - Example Sysmon rule:\n    ```xml\n    <RuleGroup Name=\"PowerShell Malware\" Priority=\"100\">\n      <Rule Name=\"PowerShell Service Creation\" EventID=\"4697\">\n        <If>\n          <Match Field=\"ServiceName\" Pattern=\"objeto_ativo\" \/>\n        <\/If>\n        <Action>Alert<\/Action>\n      <\/Rule>\n    <\/RuleGroup>\n    ```\n\n- **SIEM Integration**:\n  - Use a SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK, QRadar) to correlate logs and detect patterns like:\n    - PowerShell scripts creating services.\n    - Unusual file paths or executable hashes.\n\n#### **D. Verify the Executable**\n- **Check File Integrity**:\n  - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Kaspersky**, or **Windows Defender** to scan `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n  - Check the file's **hash** against databases like VirusTotal or Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center.\n  - Verify the file's **digital signature** (if present) to ensure it's from a trusted source.\n\n- **Quarantine or Remove the File**:\n  - If the file is malicious, delete it and remove the service:\n    ```powershell\n    Stop-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n    Remove-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n    ```\n\n#### **E. User Education and Privilege Control**\n- **Least Privilege**:\n  - Ensure users do not run with administrative privileges unless necessary.\n  - Restrict PowerShell execution to privileged accounts only.\n\n- **User Training**:\n  - Educate users on the risks of running untrusted PowerShell scripts.\n  - Avoid clicking on links or downloading files from unverified sources.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Immediate Actions**\n1. **Scan the System**:\n   - Run a full system scan with Windows Defender and third-party antivirus tools.\n   - Check for the presence of `tarefa_logico.exe` in `C:\\unidade_logico\\...`.\n\n2. **Remove the Service**:\n   - If the service is malicious, stop and remove it:\n     ```powershell\n     Stop-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n     Remove-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Audit Logs**:\n   - Review Windows Event Logs for other suspicious activity (e.g., unauthorized logins, file modifications).\n\n4. **Update Policies**:\n   - Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies and AppLocker rules.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Long-Term Recommendations**\n- **Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:\n  - Tools like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can detect and block such attacks in real time.\n- **Regular Patching**:\n  - Keep Windows and all software up to date to close vulnerabilities.\n- **Network Segmentation**:\n  - Limit lateral movement by isolating critical systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThe PowerShell script is likely part of a malware campaign. To prevent future attacks:\n- **Restrict PowerShell execution** and use **AppLocker\/WDAC**.\n- **Monitor logs** for service creation and unusual file activity.\n- **Verify the integrity** of suspicious files.\n- **Educate users** and enforce **least privilege**.\n\nIf the file is confirmed malicious, remove it immediately and investigate the source of the infection."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first two entries are about creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe and then starting that service. That seems suspicious because creating a new service and starting it via PowerShell could be part of an attack, especially if the binary isn't a known, legitimate process.\n\nThen there are several entries where PowerShell is run with the ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which is a bit odd. Normally, Restricted is the default, so that's not necessarily bad, but the commands being run are simple like Write-Host, which might be a red herring. However, the repeated commands could be part of testing or probing the system.\n\nThe more concerning part is the command that checks INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns. The script is looking for sections like [defaultinstall.nt...], which are typically found in INF files used for driver installation. This could be a sign of someone checking for existing drivers or trying to install malicious ones. The fact that this command is repeated multiple times might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system's configuration, possibly for exploitation later on.\n\nPutting it all together, the creation of a new service and the repeated checks on INF files suggest potential malicious activity. Even though some commands are benign, the combination of creating a service and probing system files raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of a security breach, but the activities are definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands creating a new service with a custom executable and scanning system INF files for driver installation sections, which may indicate malicious activity or system reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All three entries are about PowerShell commands being executed. The command line is the same in each case, so maybe they're part of the same process or being logged multiple times. The command is checking for INF files in the Windows directory that contain specific sections related to different architectures (like amd64, x86, etc.). The script is looking for the presence of these sections, which might be part of an installation or configuration process.\n\nNow, why would this be suspicious? Well, INF files are used in Windows setup and installation. If an attacker is trying to modify or install drivers or other system components, they might look for these sections. The fact that the script is searching through INF files could indicate someone is checking for existing configurations that might be exploited. However, this alone isn't necessarily malicious. It could be a legitimate diagnostic tool or part of a software installation process.\n\nBut wait, the PowerShell command is using the Restricted execution policy, which is the default. That's normal. The script is reading content from INF files, which isn't inherently bad. However, the repetition of the same command across different log entries (with tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle) might indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's some automated system checking these files. Alternatively, if this is part of a larger attack, like checking for vulnerabilities in system INF files, it could be a precursor to more malicious activity.\n\nBut looking at just these three logs, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The script's purpose is to check for specific INF sections, which could be part of a legitimate process. However, the fact that it's being logged multiple times and the use of PowerShell for such a task might raise some flags. Still, without additional context or other suspicious activities (like file modifications, network connections, or other processes), it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting. The confidence here would be moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while it's not obviously malicious, it's not entirely benign either. The justification would be that the script is scanning INF files, which could be part of an installation or exploitation attempt, but more data is needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The same PowerShell command is repeatedly scanning INF files in the Windows directory for architecture-specific installation sections, which could indicate reconnaissance for potential exploitation of system configuration files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
