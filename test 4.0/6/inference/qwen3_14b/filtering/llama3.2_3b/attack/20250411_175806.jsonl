The first event shows cmd.exe adding a registry entry under HKCU's Run key, pointing to estrutura_principal.exe. The second event is reg.exe adding another entry in the same Run key for pacote_temporario.exe. Both are modifying the registry to execute files on startup. The third event is a registry value set, which might be related to the previous actions. Then there's powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder and accessing a process. \n\nHmm, modifying the Run registry key is a common tactic for persistence. The fact that two different executables are added here could indicate an attempt to ensure the malware runs even if one is removed. The file creation by PowerShell might be part of initial exploitation or data exfiltration. However, the presence of a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily malicious on its own. But combined with the registry changes, it's suspicious. The events don't show obvious signs of data exfiltration or network activity, but the persistence mechanisms are concerning. I need to check if all these events are part of a legitimate process. Maybe the user is doing some system configuration, but adding multiple executables to the Run key is unusual. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malware, but the combination of registry modifications and file creation does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications in the Run key (HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run) are detected, which is a common technique for persistence.
