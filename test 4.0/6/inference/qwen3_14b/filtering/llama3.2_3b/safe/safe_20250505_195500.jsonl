{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created in the same directory under Microsoft Office's Resources\/OfflineFiles. The process involved is SDXHost.exe, which I think is related to Microsoft's Search and Indexing service. The files created have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min.js, which might be JavaScript files. \n\nNow, why would this be suspicious? Well, normally, SDXHost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's creating a lot of JavaScript files in a directory that's not typical for it, that could be a red flag. However, looking at the filenames, they seem to be minified JavaScript files. Minified files are common in web applications and sometimes used in software for performance. But why so many of them? And why in that specific directory?\n\nWait, the directory path is C:\\Users$$username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\... That's part of the Office installation. Maybe these files are part of an update or some new feature. However, the fact that there are multiple files with similar names might indicate that they're being generated dynamically. But is that normal?\n\nAnother point is that all the events are File Creation events. If this is part of a normal operation, there might be a pattern or a known process. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of something malicious. But without more context, like other events (like network activity, registry changes, or process execution), it's hard to tell. \n\nAlso, the filenames have \"officeaicopilot\" in them. Maybe that's a typo or a misinterpretation. Could it be \"officeai\" or something related to AI features in Office? If these files are part of a legitimate feature, then it's normal. But if they're being created by a process that's not supposed to generate such files, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the SDXHost.exe process is usually associated with the Windows Search service. If this process is creating JavaScript files, maybe it's being exploited or there's a malicious payload. However, without seeing other suspicious activities, it's hard to confirm.\n\nBut considering that all the events are file creations in a specific directory by the same process, and the files are named in a pattern that might not be typical for that process, this could be worth investigating further. Maybe the system is being used for something unexpected, or there's a misconfiguration. However, without additional data, it's a bit of a judgment call. The presence of multiple files with similar names might be benign, but it's on the edge of what's considered normal. So, I think this is a low to medium priority for investigation, but not necessarily a high threat. The answer would be that it's interesting but needs more context to determine if it's malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Log Entries:**\n\n1. **Process and Activity:**\n   - All events involve the creation of JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users$$username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\...`.\n   - The responsible process is **SDXHost.exe**, associated with **Windows Search (SearchIndexer)** and **Microsoft Office**.\n\n2. **File Naming and Patterns:**\n   - The filenames follow a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` with unique hashes (e.g., `min_0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305.js`).\n   - \"Min\" suggests **minified JavaScript**, common in web applications and some software, but unusual for system processes like SDXHost.exe.\n\n3. **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n   - **Unusual Activity for SDXHost.exe:** SDXHost.exe typically manages indexing and search operations, not JavaScript file creation. This may indicate a **misconfiguration**, **exploitation**, or **malicious activity**.\n   - **Lack of Context:** No additional events (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or process execution) are provided to confirm legitimacy.\n   - **File Naming Anomalies:** The inclusion of \"aicopilot\" (possibly a typo or obfuscation) and repeated file creation may suggest **unauthorized scripting** or **payload delivery**.\n\n4. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious:**\n   - **Legitimate Possibilities:** The files could be part of a **new Office feature**, **update**, or **third-party integration** (e.g., AI tools like Copilot). However, this would be unusual for SDXHost.exe.\n   - **Suspicious Possibilities:** The activity could indicate **malware** leveraging SDXHost.exe to persist or execute scripts, or **data exfiltration** via generated files.\n\n5. **Recommendation:**\n   - **Investigate Further:** Correlate with other logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree, registry changes) to determine if the files are benign or malicious.\n   - **Check for Updates:** Ensure Office and Windows are up to date, as this could be a **legitimate update**.\n   - **Monitor Behavior:** Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** to analyze SDXHost.exe's behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe activity is **notably unusual for SDXHost.exe** and warrants **further investigation**. While it could be a legitimate update or feature, the lack of context and the atypical file generation raise **low-to-medium risk concerns**. No definitive malicious intent is confirmed, but vigilance is advised."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office Resources directory. The files all have names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a bunch of alphanumeric characters and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses this name, but it's also been associated with malware. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But the fact that so many files are being created in a short period might be suspicious.\n\nNext, looking at the file names. They all seem to be JavaScript files, possibly part of some kind of update or resource pack. The \"officeaicopilot\" part might be a reference to a feature in Office 365 or something similar. But why so many different files? Maybe they're different language packs or versions. However, the sheer number of files being created could indicate that something is trying to inject a lot of code or data into the system.\n\nAnother thing to note is the directory path: \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\resources\\en-us\\Office365\". That seems like a legitimate path for Office resources. But if the files are being created there, maybe they're replacing legitimate files or adding malicious ones. However, the presence of \"Office365\" in the path might be a red flag if the system isn't using Office 365, or if the files don't match expected Office components.\n\nI should check if the hash of these files is known. If they're all the same hash, that might indicate they're part of a legitimate update. But since I don't have access to that info, I have to rely on the logs. Also, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be a sign of a script or malware trying to distribute payloads.\n\nBut wait, Office does sometimes update its resources, so maybe this is a legitimate update. However, the fact that it's all happening through SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard process, is concerning. Also, the number of files created is quite high, which is unusual for a normal update.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"min\" in the file names suggests minified JavaScript, which is common in web applications but less so in desktop software like Office. That could be a clue that these files are not part of the standard Office installation but perhaps part of a web-based component or an add-in.\n\nPutting it all together, while the directory path is legitimate, the process name and the volume of files created might indicate a potential security threat. However, without more information, it's a bit of a toss-up. But in the absence of clear evidence pointing to legitimacy, it's safer to flag this as suspicious and recommend further investigation, like checking the process's origin, verifying file hashes, and monitoring for other unusual activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show repeated activity by the process `SDXHelper.exe` creating numerous JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the Office resources directory. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and File Names**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`**: This process is not a standard Microsoft Office component. While it may be associated with legitimate software (e.g., some third-party tools or utilities), its presence here raises concerns, as it is not typically involved in Office resource management.\n   - **File Names**: The files are minified JavaScript (`*.min.js`), which is common in web applications but less typical for desktop software like Office. The naming pattern suggests they might be language packs, configuration files, or payloads.\n\n2. **Directory Path**:\n   - The files are created in a legitimate Office resource directory (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\resources\\en-us\\Office365`). This could indicate an attempt to mimic or replace legitimate Office resources.\n\n3. **Volume and Repetition**:\n   - Over **20 files** are created in a short span, with some repeated hashes (e.g., `4738fbd98dc4bf7f50a72f08ac52629e.js` appears twice). This could suggest either:\n     - **Legitimate updates** (though unusual for such a large number of files).\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., injecting payloads, exfiltrating data, or preparing for further attacks).\n\n4. **Potential Red Flags**:\n   - **Unusual Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known Microsoft Office process. Legitimate Office updates are typically managed by `OfficeClickToRun.exe` or similar.\n   - **Minified JavaScript**: While common in web apps, this is not typical for Office desktop resources, which might use compiled binaries or XML-based configurations.\n   - **Lack of Context**: No metadata (e.g., file hashes, timestamps, or user context) is provided to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Scenarios**\n1. **Legitimate Activity**:\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a legitimate third-party tool (e.g., an Office add-in or localization utility), the files might be part of a resource update. However, this would be highly unusual and would require verification of the process's origin.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity**:\n   - The files could be **malware payloads** (e.g., scripts for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or injection of malicious code).\n   - The repetition of file hashes suggests **distribution of identical malicious payloads** across multiple files, which is common in malware campaigns.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Process**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` using tools like `sigcheck` or the Windows Defender Security Center.\n   - Investigate the **origin** of the process (e.g., registry entries, file location, and parent processes).\n\n2. **Analyze Files**:\n   - Use **static analysis** (e.g., VirusTotal, YARA rules) to check the files for malicious content.\n   - Monitor for **network activity** from `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., unusual outbound connections).\n\n3. **System Integrity Check**:\n   - Run a **full system scan** with up-to-date antivirus\/malware tools.\n   - Use **Windows Defender Offline** or **Malwarebytes** to detect hidden threats.\n\n4. **User Context**:\n   - Confirm whether the user has recently installed third-party software or add-ins that might involve `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the directory path is legitimate, the combination of **unusual process names**, **minified JavaScript files**, and **high volume of created files** strongly suggests **potential malicious activity**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a legitimate update or a security threat. **Do not ignore this activity**—it warrants immediate attention."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that the process SDXHelper.exe has created various files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's resources. The files all have names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's normal here. SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? It might be involved in some kind of localization or resource management. The files being created are minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. But why are they being created in the Office directory?\n\nNow, looking at the file names, they all have different hashes. That's typical for unique identifiers, but if there's a pattern, maybe there's something off. However, since they're all different, it might just be different versions or different resources being generated. But wait, the fact that so many files are being created in the same directory could be a red flag. If it's a legitimate process, would it create so many files? Maybe during an update or installation, but typically, such operations might not generate dozens of files in that location.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these files are created by the same process might indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, which could be part of a malicious activity. For example, malware might create numerous files to hide its presence or to execute code. But I need to check if this is a known behavior for SDXHelper.exe.\n\nAnother point is the directory path: \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\resources\\app\\app-strings\". That's a legitimate path for Office resources. However, the presence of \"Wef\" might be related to the Web Extension Framework, which is part of Office. So maybe this is related to some extension or add-in.\n\nBut then again, the sheer number of files being created here might be unusual. If this is part of a normal operation, there might be a limit to how many files are generated. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the fact that the same process is creating all these files could be normal if it's handling multiple resources, but it's something to watch.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known issues or malware associated with SDXHelper.exe. A quick check in my mind: sometimes, malicious software masquerades as legitimate processes. If this process is generating a lot of files with random names, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more data, like the process's digital signature or behavior analysis, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, this could be part of a legitimate update process where resources are being cached or generated dynamically. But again, the number of files seems high. Another angle: the files are all JavaScript, which might be used by Office's web components or add-ins. If the user is using a lot of add-ins, maybe this is normal.\n\nIn summary, while the process and directory are legitimate, the high number of files created by the same process might indicate either a normal but unusual operation or a potential security issue. Further investigation would be needed, such as checking the process's origin, verifying digital signatures, and monitoring for other suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (part of Microsoft Office) is creating numerous minified JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the directory:  \n`C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\resources\\app\\app-strings`.  \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Context**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known component of Microsoft Office, often associated with resource management or localization.\n   - The directory path (`Wef\\resources`) is tied to the **Web Extension Framework (Wef)** in Office, which handles add-ins and web-based components. The files might be part of dynamic resource generation for extensions.\n\n2. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - **High Volume of Files**: The creation of **16+ files** with unique hashes could be unusual for a normal Office operation. Legitimate processes typically do not generate this many files in a single session.\n   - **File Naming**: The use of random hashes in filenames might suggest dynamic generation, but it could also be a tactic used by malware to obfuscate its presence.\n\n3. **Malicious Behavior Indicators**:\n   - While the process and directory are legitimate, the **repetitive creation of files** by a single process might indicate:\n     - **Malware masquerading as SDXHelper.exe** (if the process is not digitally signed or behaves unexpectedly).\n     - **Resource exhaustion** or **caching anomalies** (e.g., a compromised Office installation).\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Verify Process Authenticity**:\n  - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be signed by Microsoft).\n  - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to confirm the process is not malicious.\n- **Monitor Behavior**:\n  - Use **SIEM tools** or **endpoint detection platforms** to analyze if the process interacts with suspicious networks or modifies system files.\n- **Update Office**:\n  - Ensure Office is up-to-date, as outdated versions may have vulnerabilities exploited by malware.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the activity could be **legitimate** (e.g., during add-in initialization or resource caching), the **high volume of files** and **obfuscated filenames** warrant further investigation. If the process is confirmed legitimate, it may be a rare edge case. If not, it could indicate a **compromise**."}

I know that some legitimate software uses helper processes, but sometimes malware does too. The file names here are a bit suspicious. The \"officeaicopilot\" part might be a red herring, but the hash in the filename is common in some malicious payloads. Wait, \"aicopilot\" doesn't ring a bell as a known Microsoft product. Maybe it's a typo or a fake name.\n\nNext, looking at the directory path: AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\... That's a common location for legitimate Office add-ins or updates, but also a place where malware might drop files. However, the presence of multiple files with the same naming pattern could indicate a script or installer that's generating a lot of files, which is not typical for normal operations.\n\nThe fact that all these files are created by the same process might be normal if it's part of an installation or update, but if there's no corresponding installation activity, it could be suspicious. Also, the use of .min.js files usually relates to minified JavaScript, which is common in web development but less so in desktop applications unless it's a browser extension or something similar.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: SDXHelper is sometimes associated with software like Malwarebytes or other security tools, but it's also been used by some malware. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The key here is the pattern of file creation. Creating multiple files with similar names in a specific directory could be a sign of a malicious dropper or a legitimate installer. But since the user hasn't mentioned any installation, it's more likely suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the filename includes \"aicopilot\" which might be a misspelling of \"AI copilot\" (like Microsoft's AI features), but that's speculative. If this is part of a legitimate update, the files might be part of a new feature. However, the lack of any other logs (like network activity, registry changes) makes it harder to confirm.\n\nIn summary, while not definitive proof, the repetitive file creation by a single process with suspicious filenames in a common malware target directory raises flags. It's possible this is part of a legitimate process, but without more information, the indicators lean towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show repeated activity by the process **SDXHelper.exe** creating multiple JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min*.js`) in the **Microsoft Office** directory under `AppData\\Local`. While this could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., an update or add-in), several red flags suggest potential malicious behavior:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concerns:**\n1. **Suspicious File Naming:**\n   - The filenames (`officeaicopilot-strings.min*.js`) include a hash (`e.g., 67e96e498fc9dff25b1a37`) and a `.min.js` extension, which is common in **malware payloads** or **obfuscated scripts**. Legitimate Office files typically do not use such naming conventions.\n\n2. **Repetitive File Creation:**\n   - The same process is generating **multiple files** with similar names. This pattern is often seen in **malware droppers** or **installer scripts** that drop payloads into the file system.\n\n3. **Directory Location:**\n   - The `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory is a **common target for malware** (e.g., for persistence or evasion). While legitimate Office updates may write files here, the lack of context (e.g., no installer activity) raises suspicion.\n\n4. **SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Microsoft process. While it may be associated with third-party tools (e.g., some security software or installers), its presence here without clear legitimacy is concerning.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Scenarios:**\n- **Malware:** The files could be part of a **dropper** or **loader** that executes malicious code later. The `.min.js` files might be obfuscated scripts.\n- **Legitimate Software:** If this is part of a **recent Office update** or a **third-party add-in**, the files might be benign. However, no evidence of such an update is provided in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/endpoint detection tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Procmon** to inspect the process's behavior (e.g., network activity, registry writes).\n\n2. **Verify SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Check the **file signature** (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures) to confirm if it is signed by a trusted publisher.\n   - Use **VirusTotal** to analyze the file's hash (if available).\n\n3. **Monitor for Payload Execution:**\n   - Watch for subsequent activity (e.g., execution of the `.js` files, network connections to suspicious domains).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile not definitive proof of malware, the **repetitive file creation**, **suspicious filenames**, and **unusual process** strongly suggest this could be **malicious activity**.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at this. The user provided a list of file creation events, all under the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" in the directory \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\". The files are named with a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxxxx.js\", where the \"xxxx\" part varies each time.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are normal or if they indicate a potential security issue. The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't one I recognize immediately. Maybe it's part of a legitimate software, but I should check if it's associated with any known malicious activities. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nLooking at the file names, they all have the same base name but different hashes or identifiers. This could be part of a legitimate update or resource loading, especially if the files are being generated dynamically. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same directory might be suspicious. \n\nAnother point is the directory path. The \"AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\" folder is typically used by Microsoft Office applications. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is not a known Microsoft process, this might be an indicator of a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one. \n\nI should also consider the number of files created. There are 16 entries here, which is a lot for a single process. Legitimate processes usually don't create that many files in a short period unless they're part of an installation or update. However, if this is part of a normal operation, it might be expected. \n\nLooking at the file names again, they all end with \".min.js\", which is common for minified JavaScript files. This could be part of a web application or a software that uses JavaScript resources. However, the presence of multiple such files might indicate that the application is loading a lot of resources, which could be normal or could be a sign of something else, like a downloader or a malicious payload.\n\nI should also check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind (since I can't browse the internet) tells me that there's no widely known legitimate software by that name. It's possible that this is a false positive, but without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that all the files are created by the same process in the same directory might indicate that the process is generating these files on the fly. This could be part of a legitimate operation, but it could also be a sign of a malicious process creating temporary files or downloading additional components.\n\nIn terms of security best practices, any unexpected process creating multiple files in a system directory, especially one that's not commonly associated with the process name, should be investigated further. Checking the process's digital signature, verifying its location on the filesystem, and ensuring it's not part of a known malware family would be necessary steps.\n\nHowever, since the user hasn't provided additional context, like the system's behavior, other logs, or the source of the process, I can't be certain. The answer should highlight the potential concerns and suggest further investigation steps.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is generating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxxxx.js`) in the directory:  \n`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`.  \n\n### Key Observations and Analysis:\n1. **Process Name (SDXHelper.exe):**  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a widely recognized legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office or common software. This raises suspicion, as the filename lacks a clear connection to known applications.  \n   - If this process is not part of a verified application, it could be a **malicious payload** or a **trojan** masquerading as a legitimate helper tool.\n\n2. **File Creation Pattern:**  \n   - The files are named with a consistent pattern (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`), suggesting they may be **minified JavaScript resources**. However, the repetition of the same base name with varying hashes could indicate:  \n     - **Legitimate resource loading** (e.g., dynamic updates or localization files).  \n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., downloading additional payloads or obfuscated code).  \n\n3. **Directory Location:**  \n   - The files are stored in the **Microsoft Office AppData directory**, which is typically used by legitimate applications. However, **unauthorized processes** creating files here may indicate **tampering** or **malware** attempting to blend in with legitimate system activity.\n\n4. **Quantity and Repetition:**  \n   - **16 files** created by the same process in a short timeframe is unusual for standard operations. This could signal:  \n     - **Malware** generating temporary files or downloading components.  \n     - **Legitimate software** during an update, but this would typically be accompanied by user interaction or a known installer.  \n\n---\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- **Malware Infection:** The process could be a **downloader** or **dropper** generating files for further malicious activity.  \n- **False Positive:** If **SDXHelper.exe** is part of a legitimate application (e.g., a third-party tool or custom software), this behavior might be normal. However, this is unlikely without additional context.  \n\n---\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n1. **Verify the Process:**  \n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (right-click > Properties > Details tab). Legitimate software typically has a valid publisher.  \n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **VirusTotal** to scan the file.  \n\n2. **Investigate the Source:**  \n   - Determine how **SDXHelper.exe** was installed (e.g., via downloads, email attachments, or USB drives).  \n   - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be in a trusted directory like `C:\\Program Files` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`).  \n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior:**  \n   - Use **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals tools** to track the process's network activity, registry access, and file operations.  \n   - Look for unusual connections to external servers or modifications to system files.  \n\n4. **Remove Suspicious Files:**  \n   - If the process is confirmed malicious, delete the generated files and uninstall the associated application.  \n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile the behavior could theoretically be legitimate (e.g., a niche application), the **unusual process name**, **directory location**, and **high volume of file creation** strongly suggest a **malicious process**. Further investigation is critical to confirm the nature of the activity.  \n\nIf you can provide additional context (e.g., the source of the process, system behavior, or error messages), a more precise analysis can be performed."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by the SDXHelper process in the Office application's directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_... followed by a hash and .js extension. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what these files are. The name \"officeaicopilot\" makes me think of Microsoft's AI Copilot feature in Office. The \".min\" suggests they're minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications for optimization.\n\nNow, why are these files being created? If they're part of a legitimate update or installation, that's normal. But if they're being generated repeatedly or in unexpected locations, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, all the files are in the expected Office resources directory, which is under AppData. That seems legitimate for Office to store temporary or localized files.\n\nLooking at the process name, SDXHelper is a known process related to Microsoft's Office, specifically for handling certain tasks like updates or add-ins. So, it's plausible that these files are part of a legitimate operation.\n\nBut wait, are there any red flags? The fact that there are multiple entries for the same file might indicate that the process is being run multiple times, but that's not necessarily bad. If the files are being created in a user's AppData folder, that's a common place for temporary files. \n\nI should also check if the hashes are known. The hashes in the filenames are unique, which could be versioning or identifiers for different builds. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother angle: if this is part of a malware attack, the files might be malicious scripts. But since they're named as minified JS and located in Office's directory, it's more likely they're legitimate. Unless there's a known exploit related to these files, which I'm not aware of.\n\nSo, considering all that, these events seem to be part of normal Office operations. The SDXHelper process creating these JavaScript files in the AppData directory is probably a standard activity, maybe related to updating or configuring the AI Copilot feature. There's no immediate indication of malicious activity here. However, if there are other suspicious events alongside these, that could change the assessment. But based solely on the provided information, it's likely benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the creation of minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory by the `SDXHelper` process. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and Location:**\n   - **SDXHelper** is a legitimate Microsoft process associated with **Microsoft Office** (specifically, it handles tasks like updates, add-ins, and AI Copilot features).\n   - The files are stored in the **Office application's temporary or resource directory** (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`), which is a **normal location** for Office-related files.\n\n2. **File Naming and Purpose:**\n   - The files are **minified JavaScript** (`*.min.js`), commonly used in web and desktop applications for performance optimization.\n   - The filename pattern (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) suggests they are **localized or configuration strings** for the **AI Copilot** feature in Office (e.g., language-specific resources or UI strings).\n\n3. **Repetition of Events:**\n   - Multiple entries for the same file may indicate **repeated creation** (e.g., during updates, installations, or language pack downloads). This is **not inherently suspicious** if tied to legitimate Office operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Malicious?**\n- **Likely Benign:** \n  - The process (`SDXHelper`) and location (`AppData\\Office`) are **legitimate** for Office.\n  - The files are **named consistently** with typical Office resource files and do not match known malicious payloads.\n  - No **unusual behavior** (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or execution of scripts) is reported in the logs.\n\n- **Possible Scenarios:**\n  - **Office Update\/Installation:** The files could be part of an **update** or **language pack** for the AI Copilot feature.\n  - **Temporary Resource Files:** They might be temporary files generated during Office runtime (e.g., for dynamic UI components).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Monitor for Anomalies:**\n   - If these files are **created outside** the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory or by **unrelated processes**, investigate further.\n   - Check for **unusual network activity** or **unexpected execution** of these files (e.g., via PowerShell or other scripting tools).\n\n2. **Verify File Integrity:**\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Microsoft Safety Scanner** to scan the files for malware.\n   - Compare the hashes of these files with **Microsoft's official repositories** (if available) to confirm legitimacy.\n\n3. **Contextual Correlation:**\n   - If these events occur alongside **other suspicious logs** (e.g., unauthorized access, unexpected process creation), investigate for potential compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe described activity is **likely legitimate**, tied to **Microsoft Office's AI Copilot feature** or updates. However, **monitoring** and **correlating with other logs** is recommended to ensure no malicious activity is occurring under the guise of these files."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I'll look through the events. There are multiple entries from SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. Then there are events from chrome.exe creating and modifying a downloaded Excel file, including Zone.Identifier streams, which are usually related to file origination (like marking files as coming from the internet). \n\nThe SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, maybe related to add-ins or updates. But creating so many JavaScript files with different hashes in the OfflineFiles folder might be unusual. Normally, Office might store some resources there, but the repetition of the same filenames with different hashes could indicate something odd. Also, the user is downloading an Excel file, which is normal, but the Zone.Identifier streams are part of the file's metadata, which is typical when a file is downloaded from the internet. \n\nHowever, the main thing here is that SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files. If this is part of a legitimate Office update or package, it might be normal. But if there's an unusual number of files being created, especially with varying hashes, that could be a sign of malicious activity, like downloading additional components or payloads. However, without more context, like the hashes being known malicious or other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe other events are from chrome.exe and EXCEL.EXE, which seem normal. The Zone.Identifier is a standard Windows feature to track where a file came from. The ImageLoad event for urlmon.dll is also normal, as that's part of Internet Explorer and used for downloading files. \n\nSo the key points are the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe. If this is a legitimate process, it's part of Office's operations. But if there's no prior knowledge of this behavior, it might be worth investigating. However, since the user hasn't provided any other suspicious activities or known bad indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the answer is that it's not necessarily malicious but warrants further inspection, especially checking the hashes against known databases. But based on the given data, there's no clear malicious intent. So the classification might be low risk, but the logs are somewhat unusual and could be interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs show a mix of normal and potentially noteworthy activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **Chrome and Excel Operations**:\n   - Chrome creating\/modify a downloaded Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) with `Zone.Identifier` streams (standard for tracking file origination).\n   - `EXCEL.EXE` launching the file (normal user behavior).\n   - `urlmon.dll` being loaded (part of Windows' URL handling, common for downloads).\n\n### **Potentially Interesting Activity**\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creations**:\n   - Multiple files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` are created in `Office16\\Root\\Resources` under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\`. \n   - **Key Points**:\n     - **Repetition of Filenames with Unique Hashes**: While SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Office component, creating numerous files with varying hashes in the `OfflineFiles` directory could indicate:\n       - **Legitimate Behavior**: Office may cache or update resources dynamically.\n       - **Suspicious Behavior**: If these files are not part of a known Office update or if the hashes match known malicious payloads, this could signal tampering or a dropper.\n     - **Lack of Context**: No additional indicators (e.g., network activity, process anomalies, or file execution) are provided to confirm malicious intent.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Risk Level**: **Low to Medium**. The activity is not definitively malicious but warrants further investigation.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  - Check the hashes of the created `.js` files against threat intelligence databases (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).\n  - Monitor for additional suspicious behavior (e.g., network connections, unexpected process execution).\n  - Verify if the files are part of a legitimate Office update or if they correlate with known malicious campaigns.\n\n**Final Verdict**: The logs are **interesting for further analysis** but not conclusively malicious at this stage."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE. The SDXHelper.exe is creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames have hashes and language codes, like \"af-za-ui-strings-json\" and \"ar-sa-ui-strings-json\". That seems odd because normally, Office might have some localization files, but creating so many JS files with different language codes might be a red flag. Also, some of the files are duplicated, like the ar-sa one appearing twice. Maybe that's a mistake, or maybe it's part of some malicious activity.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, coml2.dll, combase.dll, and mscoreei.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's normal. But there's also a File stream created event for a temporary Excel file, 1680A406.xlsx, and a Zone.Identifier stream. Zone.Identifier is usually used by Windows to mark files as coming from a different zone (like the internet), which can trigger security warnings. But in this case, it's part of the Temp directory, which might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be a sign of something.\n\nThe main concern here is SDXHelper.exe creating all those JS files. SDXHelper isn't a standard Microsoft process. A quick check in my mind: Office applications usually don't generate so many JS files in the SolutionPackages folder. Those files could be part of a malicious payload, maybe a dropper or some kind of script that's being executed. Also, the repetition of certain files might indicate an attempt to overwrite or inject code.\n\nAnother point is the presence of the Zone.Identifier. If the Excel file was downloaded from the internet and the Zone.Identifier is set, it might be a sign that the file was flagged as a potential threat. But if the user is working with such files, it's possible. However, combined with the SDXHelper activity, it raises more questions.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious events. The registry key modifications or other process behaviors aren't mentioned here, so maybe the logs are limited. But based on what's here, the creation of multiple JS files by an unfamiliar process in a non-standard location is a red flag. It could be part of a larger attack, like a document-based exploit where the JS files are used to execute malicious code.\n\nSo, putting this together, the batch is interesting because of the unusual file creation by SDXHelper.exe and the potential malicious intent behind those files. Even though some activities are normal (like EXCEL loading DLLs), the combination of the SDXHelper's actions suggests a need for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Multiple JavaScript (`.js`) files** are created in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\OfflineFiles` directory. These files have names like:\n     - `as-in-ui-strings-json_07b3b1cb7e3b3b51784f64d66647a936.js`\n     - `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json_5e0c6cbf4a22eabb48d56779beb83039.js`\n   - **Hashes in filenames** (e.g., `1680A406.xlsx`) and **language codes** (e.g., `af-za`, `bg-bg`) suggest potential **localization or malicious payloads**. Such patterns are uncommon in legitimate Office operations.\n\n2. **Redundant File Creation:**\n   - Some files (e.g., `as-in-ui-strings-json_07b3b1cb7e3b3b51784f64d66647a936.js`) are created **multiple times**, which could indicate **overwriting, injection, or failed attempts** to execute malicious code.\n\n3. **`SDXHelper.exe` as a Non-Standard Process:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is **not a recognized Microsoft Office process**. Its role in creating files in a non-standard location (`SolutionPackages\\OfflineFiles`) raises concerns about **unauthorized or malicious activity**.\n\n4. **Temporary Excel File with `Zone.Identifier`:**\n   - The file `1680A406.xlsx` is created in a temporary directory (`Packages\\oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_2bd7\\AC\\Temp`) with a **`Zone.Identifier` stream**. This often marks files as originating from a \"dangerous zone\" (e.g., the internet), which could trigger **security warnings**. Its association with `EXCEL.EXE` may indicate **exploitation via malicious documents**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity (Not Suspicious):**\n- **`EXCEL.EXE` loading system DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `coml2.dll`) is normal for Excel operations.\n- **File stream creation** for temporary files is common during document processing.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malicious Script Injection:** The `.js` files created by `SDXHelper.exe` could be **exploits or droppers** (e.g., embedded scripts to execute payloads).\n- **Document-Based Attack:** The `1680A406.xlsx` file might be part of a **phishing or zero-day exploit** targeting Excel users.\n- **Untrusted Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` may be **malware masquerading as a legitimate process**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Isolate the System:** If this is a production environment, isolate the affected host for analysis.\n2. **Check for Malware:** Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/EDR tools.\n3. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Verify its **digital signature** and **file hash** against known repositories (e.g., VirusTotal, Microsoft Defender).\n   - Check its **parent process** and **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs).\n4. **Analyze the `.js` Files:**\n   - Inspect the content of the `.js` files for **malicious code** (e.g., PowerShell commands, encoded payloads).\n5. **Review User Activity:** Determine if the user interacted with **untrusted documents** or URLs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs suggest **potential malware activity** or **exploitation via malicious Office documents**. Immediate investigation is required to confirm whether `SDXHelper.exe` and the associated `.js` files are part of a **malicious attack chain**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. There are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file paths have names like \"bg-bg-ui-strings-json\", \"fabric\", \"bundle\", etc. These look like resource files, maybe part of an add-in or some Office solution. But why so many files being created? Also, there are duplicates, like the same file being created twice. That might be normal if it's part of an installation or update, but maybe not.\n\nThen there are entries from EXCEL.EXE creating a shortcut file in the Recent folder. That seems normal too, as Excel often creates shortcuts for recently opened files. However, there are seven registry value set events from EXCEL.EXE. Registry changes can be suspicious if they're modifying keys that control system behavior, but without knowing what specific values are being set, it's hard to tell. The logs don't specify the registry keys or the changes made, so that's a bit of a red flag. But maybe it's just part of Excel's normal operation.\n\nWait, the process field for one of the events is null, and the task is \"None\". That might be a placeholder or an error in the log, but not sure. Also, looking at the file paths again, the SolutionPackages directory is typically used by Office add-ins. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, then creating these files might be normal. However, if SDXHelper.exe is a third-party or malicious process, this could be a sign of something bad.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any context on whether SDXHelper.exe is legitimate. In a real scenario, I'd check if that process is known to be part of Office or another trusted application. Since I can't do that here, I have to rely on the logs. The fact that multiple files are being created in a structured way might be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the repeated file creations (same file twice) could indicate an issue, like a failed installation trying again.\n\nThe registry events from Excel are a bit concerning. If they're modifying keys related to security settings, startup items, or other critical areas, that's a problem. But without more details, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple registry changes might be normal for Excel, but it's something to note.\n\nPutting it all together, the logs show normal activities like file creation by SDXHelper.exe and Excel creating shortcuts. However, the number of registry changes and the lack of information about them might be a point of concern. But without more context or indicators of compromise (like unexpected processes, unusual network activity, etc.), it's hard to classify this as a security incident. Therefore, the justification would be that while some activities are normal, the volume and lack of detail on registry changes warrant further investigation. The confidence might be around 0.6, indicating it's somewhat suspicious but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Interesting for further investigation\",\n  \"justification\": \"The logs show multiple file creations by 'SDXHelper.exe' in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which could indicate legitimate add-in operations or potential malicious activity. The repeated creation of identical files (e.g., 'office_2e97d65336bd5d3533e966e9de09077e.js') raises questions about redundancy or failed operations. Additionally, 'EXCEL.EXE' generated seven registry modification events without specific details, which may warrant scrutiny for unexpected configuration changes. While some activity aligns with normal Office behavior, the combination of these events and lack of context suggests the need for deeper analysis.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event is about EXCEL.EXE performing a DNS query. That's normal, maybe part of regular operations. Then there's a bunch of entries where SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like \"en-us-ui-strings-json\" and \"vendor_js\", which sound like they could be part of an Office add-in or some localization files.\n\nWait, but why so many files being created? SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office, especially for handling add-ins and solutions. However, the repetition of certain files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple packages with different language codes (like da-dk, de-de, el-gr) suggests that this might be part of a legitimate Office installation or update. But sometimes, malware can mimic legitimate processes.\n\nHmm, but looking at the file paths, they're all within the SolutionPackages folder, which is a standard location for Office solutions. The filenames include hashes or unique identifiers, which is common for packaged files. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is involved in creating so many files could indicate either a normal update process or potentially malicious activity. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of unusual activity elsewhere. The DNS query from Excel might be normal, but if there's no other suspicious activity, maybe this is just a software update. However, without more context, like the source of the files or network activity, it's hard to tell. The key here is that all the files are being created by a legitimate process, and the paths are correct. So, unless there's other indicators, this might be a false positive.

Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process Involvement:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is associated with Microsoft Office and is used for managing add-ins, solutions, and localized resources. The file creation events align with typical Office operations, such as deploying or updating add-ins.\n\n2. **File Naming and Structure:**\n   - Files like `en-us-ui-strings-json`, `vendor_js`, and language-specific files (e.g., `de-de-ui-strings-json`) suggest **localization resources** or **third-party add-in components**. The inclusion of hashes (e.g., `328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10.js`) is consistent with packaged files for version control or integrity checks.\n\n3. **Repetition of Events:**\n   - Some files (e.g., `vendor_6885c85796bd643fd6bc6d7029ad257e.js`) are created multiple times. This could indicate:\n     - **Redundant operations** during an update or deployment.\n     - **Malicious activity** mimicking legitimate processes (though no clear evidence of this is present here).\n\n4. **DNS Query by EXCEL.EXE:**\n   - The initial DNS query by **EXCEL.EXE** is likely part of normal Office functionality (e.g., connecting to cloud services or updates).\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional data (e.g., network traffic, file content analysis, or user behavior), it is challenging to confirm if these events are benign or malicious.\n- **Abnormal File Volume:** The high number of file creations might be unusual for a standard Office update, though it could still be part of a complex add-in deployment.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Monitor for Anomalies:** Check for unexpected network activity, unusual parent processes, or deviations from baseline behavior.\n- **Verify File Integrity:** Use tools like **Microsoft Defender** or **SIEM** to validate the authenticity of the files and ensure they match known good hashes.\n- **Review Add-in Sources:** Confirm that any add-ins or solutions being deployed are from trusted sources.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **likely legitimate** and part of a Microsoft Office update or add-in deployment. However, the repetition of file creations and lack of context warrant further investigation to rule out potential misuse of the SDXHelper.exe process.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're suspicious. Let's start by looking at the common elements.\n\nFirst, most of the events have the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. The file names look like they're language-specific UI strings, such as \"fa-fr-ui-strings-json_...\" and so on. That seems normal for Office solutions that support multiple languages. But then there's one event with \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting logs, typically part of the Elastic Stack. \n\nNow, why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many files? If this is part of a legitimate Office add-in or solution, it might be generating these language packs. But the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file might be a red flag. Usually, winlogbeat is used for monitoring and logging, but if it's being used in a user's Downloads folder, maybe it's part of a setup or configuration. However, the fact that there's only one event related to winlogbeat might not be enough to conclude anything malicious.\n\nAnother thing to check is the file paths. The SDXHelper.exe files are all in the SolutionPackages directory, which is a common place for Office solutions to store their data. The winlogbeat file is in the Downloads folder, which is more typical for user-installed software. But if the user isn't aware of installing winlogbeat, that could be suspicious.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the user might be setting up a development environment or using tools that require logbeat. Without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that most events are from SDXHelper.exe creating a lot of language-specific files might be normal for a multilingual application. But maybe the sheer number of files is unusual. Wait, looking at the list, there are multiple entries for the same file being created multiple times. For example, \"fa-fr-ui-strings-json_...\" appears twice. That could indicate that the process is repeatedly creating the same file, which might be a sign of a loop or an error.\n\nAlso, the presence of \"winlogbeat.exe\" in the list is a bit out of place compared to the other entries. If the user is not monitoring logs or using Elastic tools, this might be unexpected. However, it's possible that the user is using these tools for legitimate purposes.\n\nIn summary, while the majority of the events seem to be part of a normal Office solution setup with multiple language packs, the presence of winlogbeat.exe and the repetition of file creation by SDXHelper.exe could be worth investigating further. But without additional context or other suspicious activities, it's not conclusive evidence of a security threat. The answer might be that it's not suspicious, but the user should verify if these tools are expected in their environment.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON events do not indicate suspicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n   - The process `SDXHelper.exe` is creating files in the expected directory `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, which is common for Office add-ins or solutions.\n   - The filenames (e.g., `xx-xx-ui-strings-json_...`) suggest language-specific resource files, which are typical for multilingual applications or Office solutions.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity**:\n   - A single event shows `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory. This is consistent with Winlogbeat's role as a log collector (part of the Elastic Stack), often used during configuration or setup. The file path is standard for user-installed tools.\n\n3. **No Red Flags**:\n   - No unusual file types (e.g., `.exe`, `.dll`, or malicious extensions) are present.\n   - No repeated or anomalous behavior (e.g., excessive file creation, network activity, or privilege escalation) is indicated.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events appear legitimate and likely part of a normal Office solution deployment or log configuration. No immediate security concerns are evident. However, if the user did not intentionally install Winlogbeat or the Office solution, further investigation into the source of these processes is advisable. \n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe activity is not suspicious. It aligns with typical behavior for Office solutions and log collection tools like Winlogbeat. No malicious intent is indicated."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like \"en-us-ui-strings-json\" and other language codes. That seems normal for localization files, maybe part of an Office add-in or something.\n\nBut wait, there's a lot of repetition here. The same file paths are appearing multiple times. Like, the ka-ge and km-kh files are each logged twice. That might be a red flag. Also, there's one event where the process is null and the task is \"None,\" which is unusual. Then there's an entry where EXCEL.EXE sets a registry value. Hmm, that's a different process, but is that suspicious?\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, used for handling add-ins or other components. So creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal. However, the repetition of the same files could indicate a loop or a potential issue. Maybe the system is trying to create the same files repeatedly, which could be a sign of a problem, like a failed installation or a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one.\n\nAlso, the registry event from EXCEL.EXE might be normal if it's part of a legitimate update or configuration change. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the main concern here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a normal operation, then maybe it's not a problem. But if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the presence of the event with process null. That might be an error in the logging or an actual event where the process couldn't be determined. It might not be significant on its own, but combined with the other events, it could indicate a broader issue.\n\nIn summary, while some of these events could be normal, the repetition and the presence of an unexpected null process entry make this worth investigating further. It's possible that this is a benign process, but the anomalies here suggest that it's not entirely straightforward. Therefore, it's probably a good idea to flag this for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Pattern:** Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating files in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...` with names like `[language-code]-ui-strings-json.js`. These files appear to be localization resources (e.g., `en-us`, `ka-ge`, `km-kh`).\n   - **Concern:** The **same files are logged multiple times** (e.g., `ka-ge-ui-strings-json` appears twice). This could indicate:\n     - A **loop or error** in the process (e.g., failed installation, corrupted files).\n     - A **malicious process** mimicking legitimate behavior (e.g., generating redundant files to evade detection).\n\n2. **Null Process Entry:**\n   - One event has `process: null` and `task: \"None\"`, which is **unusual** and may indicate:\n     - A **logging error** (incomplete data capture).\n     - A **hidden or unauthorized activity** (e.g., a process that evaded detection).\n\n3. **Registry Modification by `EXCEL.EXE`:**\n   - A single event logs `EXCEL.EXE` setting a registry value. While this could be part of normal operations (e.g., configuration updates), it’s worth correlating with other activity to ensure it’s legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Benign Activity:** \n  - `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft process (part of Office add-in management). Creating localization files is plausible during updates or installations.\n- **Red Flags:**\n  - **Repetition of file creation** (could indicate a stuck process or malicious behavior).\n  - **Null process entry** (incomplete data, potential hidden activity).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Repetitive File Creation:**\n   - Check the **integrity** of the files (e.g., hashes) to ensure they are not duplicates or corrupted.\n   - Monitor for **unusual disk I\/O** or CPU usage by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n2. **Analyze the Null Process Entry:**\n   - Verify if this is a **logging artifact** or a sign of a **hidden process** (e.g., via tools like Process Explorer or kernel-level monitoring).\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Events:**\n   - Check if the registry modification by `EXCEL.EXE` aligns with known Office updates or user actions.\n\n4. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Use antivirus tools to scan for threats, as malicious actors may abuse legitimate processes (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe`) for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe` creating localization files) may be normal, the **repetition of identical file creation events** and the **null process entry** warrant further investigation. These anomalies could indicate a benign issue (e.g., a failed update) or a potential security threat (e.g., malicious process masquerading as legitimate)."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the first thing I notice is that there are a bunch of events related to Excel.EXE modifying the registry. That's a lot of \"Registry value set\" events all from EXCEL.EXE. Now, Excel is a common application, but modifying the registry multiple times could be suspicious. However, I should check if there's any other activity that might indicate something malicious.\n\nThen, looking further down, there are several entries about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The file paths are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which makes me think these might be part of an add-in or some kind of Office solution. The filenames include things like \"ui-strings-json\" which sounds like language-specific resources. But why so many files being created? Also, the same file is being created multiple times, like the lo-la-ui-strings-json file appearing twice. That repetition might be a red flag.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I know that some legitimate Office add-ins might use helper executables, but the name SDXHelper doesn't ring a bell. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate application, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of registry changes by Excel and file creation by SDXHelper could indicate some form of tampering or malware.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory structure. The files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages folder, which is typically used for storing add-ins. If this is a legitimate add-in, the user might have installed it, but the lack of any other logs about installation or user interaction is concerning. Also, the fact that the same file is being created multiple times might suggest that the process is being repeated unnecessarily, which could be a sign of a script or malware dropping files.\n\nI should also check if there are any other processes or events that might indicate a broader attack. But from the given logs, it's just these two processes. The registry modifications by Excel could be part of normal operation if the user is using certain features, but combined with the SDXHelper activity, it's a bit suspicious. \n\nIn conclusion, while some of this could be legitimate, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and the creation of numerous files by an unfamiliar process like SDXHelper in a sensitive directory raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation. It's possible that this is a benign activity, but without more information, the logs do suggest potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **1. Excel.EXE Registry Modifications**\n- **Activity**: Multiple \"Registry value set\" events from `EXCEL.EXE`.\n- **Analysis**: While Excel can legitimately modify the registry (e.g., for add-ins or configuration), repeated modifications without clear context (e.g., user interaction, installation) could signal tampering. However, this alone is not conclusive of malicious intent.\n\n### **2. SDXHelper.exe File Creation**\n- **Activity**: Numerous files created by `SDXHelper.exe` in the `Office SolutionPackages` directory, such as `ui-strings-json` files for various languages.\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Legitimate Possibility**: These files might be part of an Office add-in or language pack. The `SolutionPackages` directory is used for storing Office add-ins, so this could be legitimate if the user intentionally installed such a package.\n  - **Suspicious Indicators**:\n    - **Unfamiliar Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft process. While third-party add-ins may use helper executables, the lack of context (e.g., installation logs, user action) raises concerns.\n    - **Redundant File Creation**: The same files (e.g., `lo-la-ui-strings-json`) are created multiple times, which could indicate a script or malware repeatedly dropping files.\n    - **Directory Path**: Files are placed in a directory typically used for trusted add-ins, but the absence of clear installation or user interaction makes this suspicious.\n\n### **3. Combined Activity**\n- The combination of **Excel registry changes** and **SDXHelper file creation** could suggest a **malicious payload** being deployed. For example:\n  - A malicious add-in might use `SDXHelper.exe` to inject code or modify Excel's behavior via registry changes.\n  - The repeated file creation might be part of a **dropper** or **installer** for malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate SDXHelper.exe**: Check if this process is signed by a trusted developer, its file location, and whether it appears in the system's startup or task scheduler.\n- **Review Installed Add-ins**: Check Excel for recently added add-ins or macros that might be associated with `SDXHelper.exe`.\n- **Scan for Malware**: Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/endpoint detection tools to rule out malware.\n- **Monitor Registry Changes**: Use tools like **Process Monitor** to trace which registry keys are being modified by Excel and whether they are related to legitimate operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., file creation in `SolutionPackages`) could be legitimate, the **repeated file creation by an unknown process** and **unusual registry modifications** by Excel warrant further investigation. This could indicate a **malicious add-in** or **malware** attempting to persist on the system."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and have a .js extension. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in managing solution packages. So, creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be part of its regular operations, especially when dealing with add-ins or language-specific resources.\n\nBut wait, the same file names are appearing multiple times. Like ml-in-ui-strings-json... and others. That could be part of a legitimate update or installation process. However, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity. The process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known legitimate process. The paths are all within the user's AppData directory, which is common for temporary or user-specific files.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. If it's a normal process, would it create the same file more than once? Maybe during an update, but typically, once a file is created, it's not recreated unless there's a change. But looking at the JSON entries, each line seems to be a separate event. So maybe each entry is a different file creation, just with similar naming conventions.\n\nAnother point is the use of language codes in the file names. That could be part of internationalization, so Office might be installing language packs or resources. But again, the same file being created multiple times might be suspicious. However, considering that each entry here might be a different file (even though some names are repeated), maybe it's just a lot of files being created as part of a package deployment.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other indicators of compromise. But in these logs, there's no mention of other processes, network activity, or unusual system calls. All events are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe. Since SDXHelper is a legitimate process, and the files are in a standard location, this might just be normal activity.\n\nSo, the classification here would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are consistent with legitimate behavior of a known process. However, the confidence isn't 100% because the repetition might be unusual, but without more context or other indicators, it's safer to assume it's normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which aligns with legitimate Office add-in\/resource deployment behavior. No anomalous patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
