Chrome having multiple registry value sets might be normal, but maybe not. However, the key thing here is the command lines in some of the powershell.exe entries.

That script name sounds like it could be keylogging malware. \n\nAnother entry has a command_line that's similar, with different paths but the same script name. The fact that there are multiple instances of this script being executed by powershell.exe is a red flag.

However, combined with the keystroke logging scripts, it's more suspicious.\n\nThe user 'fiddelis' might be a red herring, but the presence of multiple keystroke logging attempts from different paths suggests an attempt to steal information. Even if some events are normal, the combination of file creation, process access, and the specific scripts being run points towards malicious activity. \n\nSo, the classification should be INTERESTING because there's evidence of potential keystroke logging, which is a common malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The possible classifications are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning through the events to see what's going on. Let me look at each entry one by one. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that several of them involve PowerShell.exe executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path pointing to the TEMP directory. The command lines are similar, with different paths but the same script name and log path. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is typically associated with malicious activity, like keyloggers. \n\nThen, there's an event where a file is deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 in the Temp folder. That could be a cleanup attempt after running a script, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. \n\nAnother event mentions a pipe created, but I'm not sure about the significance of that yet. There's also an image loaded (urlmon.dll), which is a legitimate DLL, so maybe that's normal. \n\nThen there's a registry value set event. Registry changes can be part of malware persistence, so that's another red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's an event where a process is \"None\" but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and the file path points to another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That might indicate that the script was executed remotely, which is concerning. \n\nOther events involve file creations, some by PowerShell and others by svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The winlogbeat files seem related to logging software, so those might be legitimate. However, the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across multiple paths suggests that the same malicious script is being used in different locations, possibly to evade detection. \n\nAlso, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are running and creating temporary files, along with registry changes and file deletions, points towards an attempt to persist or hide the malicious activity. \n\nNow, considering all these points: the presence of keystroke logging scripts, file deletions, registry modifications, and remote command execution, these are all indicators of potentially malicious behavior. Even though some events might be benign (like the winlogbeat file creation), the combination of these specific PowerShell activities and the use of keyloggers strongly suggests a security threat. \n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any possibility of false positives. For example, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 could be a legitimate script in some contexts, but given the other suspicious activities (deletion, registry changes, remote execution), it's more likely malicious. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch of events includes multiple signs of potential malware activity, such as keylogging, file tampering, and remote execution. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level, as the combination of events is indicative of a security incident that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directories, combined with file deletions, registry modifications, and remote command execution indicators, suggest potential keystroke logging and malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
