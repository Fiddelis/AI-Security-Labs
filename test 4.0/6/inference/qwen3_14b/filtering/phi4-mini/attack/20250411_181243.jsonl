{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. There's a lot of PowerShell activity here. The first few entries show 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events for PowerShell and whoami.exe. Then there's a command line that stands out: it's running a bunch of commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and listing files in C:\\Users. That seems suspicious because those commands could be gathering system information, which is common in reconnaissance phases of an attack.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory, which might be part of executing a script. The 'Image loaded' events for mscoree.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll are normal for .NET, but combined with the other activities, it could indicate something's up. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be part of the PowerShell execution flow, but the key thing is the command line with all those system enumeration commands. \n\nPutting it all together, the multiple PowerShell processes accessing the system, creating and deleting files, and loading DLLs could be signs of a malicious script trying to gather information. The confidence is high because the combination of these events is typical of an attacker probing the system.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'get-childitem C:\\\\Users') and creating\/deleting temporary files, indicating potential system enumeration or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: net.exe running with the command 'user'. That's a legitimate Windows command, but maybe not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe. PowerShell is common, but when combined with other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a process called net1.exe. Wait, that's not a standard Windows executable. The name is similar to net.exe, but the typo in 'net1' could be a sign of a malicious file trying to mimic a legitimate one. That's a bit concerning.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command that runs several commands: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\/Users, etc. This seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That's definitely suspicious behavior, especially if it's done without authorization.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file named 'elemento_logico.txt' by PowerShell. Not sure what that's for, but file creation in user directories could be part of data exfiltration. Also, there's a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring logs, but if it's being used in an unusual way, that might be a problem.\n\nMultiple instances of PowerShell being accessed and registry values being set. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so frequent access and registry changes could indicate a compromise. The presence of 'cmdkey.exe \/list' suggests someone is trying to list stored credentials, which is a security risk.\n\nThe use of 'net localgroup' and 'net1.exe' again. Since net1 isn't a standard tool, that's another red flag. Also, the fact that there are multiple processes accessing the registry and creating files might indicate that an attacker is trying to modify system settings or install persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of non-standard executables (like net1.exe), PowerShell being used for reconnaissance, attempts to list users and credentials, and file creation in user directories points towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: non-standard executable 'net1.exe' (likely a typo\/malicious mimic of 'net.exe'), PowerShell executing reconnaissance commands (user enumeration, credential listing), and file creation in user directories. Combined with repeated process access and registry modifications, this suggests potential adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, part of the URL Moniker, used for handling URLs. So that's normal. The second event is whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command-line tool to display user information. The third is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a common administrative tool.\n\nHmm, but I need to check if there's anything suspicious here. Calculator.exe is a normal process, but sometimes attackers might use it as a dropper. However, in this case, the loaded DLL is a system file. The whoami.exe and powershell.exe are both legitimate processes. There's no indication of unusual activity here. No unexpected network connections, no anomalies in the command line arguments. The events seem to be part of normal system operations. So maybe this isn't interesting. But wait, maybe the combination of these processes being used in a way that's not typical? Like, if they were part of a sequence that's indicative of a larger attack. But with just these three events, there's not enough to suggest malicious behavior. The confidence would be low here. I think the classification is NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (Calculator.exe, whoami.exe, powershell.exe) and standard system files (urlmon.dll).
