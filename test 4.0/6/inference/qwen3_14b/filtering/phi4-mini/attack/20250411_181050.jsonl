{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first thing I notice is the use of certutil.exe with the -encode and -decode commands. That's often used for encoding and decoding files, but in this case, it's being used to encode calc.exe and then decode it into a temporary file. That's suspicious because calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but encoding and decoding it might be part of a larger malicious activity, like hiding malware.\n\nThen there's the command line for cmd.exe that includes certutil -encode and -decode. The temporary files created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory are common places for malware to store temporary files. Also, the use of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll,PcaPatchSdbTask is unusual. PcaSvc.dll is part of the Windows Update system, but using it with PcaPatchSdbTask might be a sign of something malicious trying to patch or modify system files.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe entries, they're loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These are legitimate system DLLs, but if they're being loaded by an unexpected process, it could indicate a malicious payload. Also, the multiple registry value set events might be part of configuring the malware or changing system settings to persist.\n\nThe presence of multiple certutil.exe processes creating and decoding files, combined with the registry changes and the suspicious use of rundll32, points towards a possible attack. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe are legitimate, the overall pattern of encoding, decoding, and unusual registry activity raises red flags. The confidence is high because these are known techniques used in malware to evade detection and execute payloads.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potentially hiding malicious payloads), rundll32.exe invoked with PcaPatchSdbTask (unusual), SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (possible malicious code injection), and temporary files created in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp (common in malware operations).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe triggering NetworkConnect events. That's common for browsers accessing the internet, so maybe normal behavior. But then there's a powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder named \"componente_auxiliar.txt\". Creating a file isn't necessarily bad, but the name is a bit generic. However, the next entry is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation, especially if it's setting up new logs. But why is the file named .new? Maybe it's a temporary file during configuration updates.\n\nThen there are several Registry value set events from chrome.exe. Changing registry values could be part of normal operations, but if it's done excessively or in certain keys, it might be suspicious. However, in this case, there are multiple entries, but no specific details on which registry keys are being modified. The same applies to powershell.exe triggering ProcessAccess events. Accessing processes isn't inherently malicious, but if it's accessing processes that shouldn't be accessed, that could be a red flag.\n\nNow, looking for any anomalies. The most notable thing is the powershell.exe creating a file and then modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used in attacks for executing commands, but creating a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily malicious. However, combined with registry changes and process access, it might be part of a larger pattern. However, the other events are mostly from chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which are legitimate processes.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of events. There are multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe. If this is normal, it's not an issue. But if it's an unusual number, maybe it's a sign of something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation, so that's probably not suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The most suspicious parts are the powershell.exe events, but they don't point to obvious malicious behavior. The rest are from legitimate processes. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation. However, I should check if there's any combination that could indicate a threat. For example, if powershell.exe was used to download malicious files or modify critical registry keys, but the given data doesn't show that. So the confidence would be low, but not zero. Maybe around 0.3, but I need to decide if it's interesting or not. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal browser activity (chrome.exe network connections, registry changes) and legitimate file operations (winlogbeat configuration file creation). PowerShell file creation in Downloads folder is benign without additional malicious context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
