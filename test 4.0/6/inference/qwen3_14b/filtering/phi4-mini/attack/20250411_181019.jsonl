{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, there's a bunch of process creation events and registry changes. The user mentioned analyzing the entire batch for malicious behavior.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and process creation events. That's common, but not always malicious. Then there's a cmd.exe command line that stands out. The command line includes creating a service with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist: \"c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Also, there's another sc.exe command creating another service with a non-existent script path. That's a red flag because creating services with non-existent scripts might be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nThen, there are several registry value set events. While registry changes can be normal, the combination with service creation and non-existent files is suspicious. Also, there's an image loaded event for urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a sign of something wrong. However, the main concern here seems to be the service creation with non-existent scripts. That's a common tactic in malware to hide or delay execution.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory isn't necessarily bad, but the other events are more concerning. The repeated registry changes and service creation with non-existent paths suggest someone is trying to manipulate the system, possibly for persistence or to execute code later. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the suspicious service creation and registry changes make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of services with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), 2) Frequent registry modifications, 3) PowerShell and CMD execution patterns consistent with malicious behavior, 4) Unusual process interactions (e.g., 'sc create' commands). These indicators suggest potential system compromise or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a list of JSON objects, each representing a system event. The main task is to look at all of them together and decide if there's something suspicious.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry. The first few events are about Registry value sets for ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're from legitimate processes, maybe not. But then there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe, which might be normal too.\n\nThen there are several events related to chrome.exe. A lot of them are Registry value sets. Chrome is a common application, but multiple registry changes might be a red flag. However, Chrome does a lot of stuff, so maybe that's normal. Wait, but there's also an Image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender components. Loading those from chrome.exe might be unusual. Why would Chrome load Defender DLLs? That could be a sign of something malicious, like trying to bypass security features.\n\nAlso, there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe again. PowerShell is often used in attacks, but it's also a legitimate tool. However, if combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate a problem.\n\nLooking at the frequency: chrome.exe has multiple registry changes. If it's doing that a lot, maybe it's being manipulated. But I need to check if that's typical. However, the ImageLoad events for Defender DLLs are more concerning. Those are security-related DLLs, and loading them from a non-security process like Chrome might be an indicator of compromise. For example, an attacker might try to load these DLLs to interact with security software or bypass protections.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from Chrome and PowerShell, which are common, but the repeated registry changes and loading of security-related DLLs could be signs of malicious activity. Especially since amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's antimalware scanning interface. If Chrome is loading that, maybe it's trying to disable or tamper with AMSI, which is a known tactic in malware.\n\nSo, this batch might be interesting because of the combination of multiple registry changes by Chrome and the loading of security DLLs, which could indicate an attempt to evade detection or manipulate the system.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Chrome.exe instances triggering registry modifications and loading Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which may indicate evasion techniques or malicious behavior attempting to interact with security mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
