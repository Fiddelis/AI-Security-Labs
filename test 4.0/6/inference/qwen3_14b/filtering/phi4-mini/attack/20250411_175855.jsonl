{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a mix of normal processes like chrome.exe and some system processes like MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Microsoft Defender. But then there are several instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used, which can be a red flag if they're doing suspicious things.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are a lot of Network connection detected events, which might be normal for browsers like Chrome, but the repeated NetworkConnect events could indicate something. Then there's the command_line in some entries, like the cmd.exe running dir commands searching for .key files. That seems odd because searching for keys might relate to looking for encryption keys or other sensitive data, which could be part of an attack.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. The fact that both cmd.exe and powershell.exe are involved in these changes might be significant. Additionally, the creation of files like .winlogbeat.yml.new and tarefa_geral.txt. The winlogbeat file is part of a log shipper, but creating a new config file could be an attempt to configure it for data exfiltration or other malicious purposes.\n\nHowever, there's also a legitimate process, MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. The presence of Notepad.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are also typical. But the combination of the suspicious activities with the legitimate ones might not be enough on its own. The key points here are the unusual command lines, the multiple registry changes, and the file creations. These could indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence, gather information, or set up logging. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the number of suspicious events and the actions taken, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: powershell.exe and cmd.exe executing commands to search for '.key' files (potential data exfiltration), frequent registry modifications, and file creation attempts (e.g., '.winlogbeat.yml.new') which may indicate malicious configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system file. But then there are multiple entries for svchost.exe setting registry values. That's common for normal system operations, but maybe if it's excessive, it could be a sign of something. Then there's winlogbeat creating a new configuration file, which might be part of a setup or update. \n\nNext, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe are setting registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a normal tool. The ProcessAccess events might indicate someone is trying to access processes, which could be benign or malicious. Chrome is doing a bunch of registry changes and loading DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of Windows Defender, so that's normal.\n\nThe whoami.exe command is just checking the user, which is typical. But the repeated registry changes by svchost and chrome might be worth looking into. However, most of these events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. There's no unusual file access or network activity mentioned. The confidence is moderate because while some events are normal, the repetition might hint at something, but without more context, it's not conclusive. So, maybe \"INTERESTING\" with 0.6 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, combined with process access events, suggest potential system manipulation. While some activity (e.g., calc.exe loading urlmon.dll) is benign, the volume of registry changes and process interactions warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
