The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: PowerShell.exe is creating a pipe. That's a normal activity, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to get user info. But the command line shows it's being executed normally. Next, PowerShell is accessing a process, which is also common.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation by PowerShell in the System32 directory. Wait, the path is under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Hmm, that might be a legitimate place for startup profiles, but I should note that. Then another PowerShell process with a command line that's a bit complex. The command is checking INF files for certain patterns. That might be part of a script that's looking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. Not sure yet if that's malicious, but it's a bit unusual.\n\nNext, there are several image loads from .NET Framework DLLs, which are normal for PowerShell. But then there's an image load from MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That's interesting because if a legitimate process is loading a Defender DLL, maybe that's normal, but maybe not. Then a file created in the Windows Temp directory with a .psm1 extension. That's a PowerShell module script file. Creating such a file in Temp might be suspicious if it's not expected.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process running a Dism command to disable Windows Defender. That's a red flag. Disabling Defender is a common tactic by malware to avoid detection. The Dism.exe process is being used here, which is a legitimate tool but misused in this context. Also, there are multiple File Executable Detected events for Dism.exe loading various DLLs from the Temp directory. Those DLLs (AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll) are not standard system files. They're in the Temp folder, which is a common place for malware to drop files. \n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes disabling Windows Defender, which is a significant security measure. The presence of unexpected DLLs in Temp, combined with PowerShell activities that might be probing the system (like checking INF files), suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events, especially the disabling of Defender and the use of Temp for executable files, points towards a possible attack. So, this batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities combined with attempts to disable Windows Defender via Dism.exe, creation of suspicious files in Temp directory, and loading of non-standard DLLs from temporary locations indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The files being created are in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. The names of the files include things like DismCore.dll, DismHost.exe, and various .mui files which are language-specific resources.\n\nNow, the task here is to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The key points to consider are whether these activities are normal or suspicious. Dism.exe is known to create temporary files during its operations, especially when performing tasks like system image deployment or package management. The presence of multiple DLLs and MUI files in the Temp directory might be part of a legitimate process, such as applying updates or installing features.\n\nHowever, the repeated detection of executable files being created by Dism.exe could be a red flag. Typically, Dism.exe doesn't generate executable files in the Temp directory as part of its normal operations. The fact that several executable files are being created here might indicate that something is amiss. But wait, looking at the file names again, some are .dll and .mui files. DLLs are dynamic link libraries, which are common in Windows, but .mui files are for language resources and aren't executables. The rule \"FileExecutableDetected\" might be triggering on the .dll files, which is a mistake because DLLs are not executables in the traditional sense. However, if the system's detection rules are misconfigured, this could lead to false positives.\n\nAnother angle: the Temp directory is a common place for legitimate temporary files, but if a large number of files are being created here, especially with names that resemble system components, it could be part of a malicious activity. However, the presence of files like DismCore.dll and DismProv.dll might be part of a legitimate Dism operation, especially if the user is running a deployment task. \n\nBut wait, the user's name here is \"fiddelis\". That might be a red herring unless there's a known association. Without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the GUID in the path is typical for temporary directories, so that's normal.\n\nThe key question is whether the creation of these files by Dism.exe is part of a normal process. If the user is running a legitimate Dism command, this could be expected. However, if there's no such activity and these files are being created without user interaction, that's suspicious. But the logs don't provide information about the user's actions or the context in which Dism.exe is running.\n\nGiven that all the files are in the Temp directory and the process is Dism.exe, which is a legitimate tool, this might be a false positive due to the detection rule being too broad. However, the repeated creation of executable files (even if they're DLLs) by a system process in the Temp directory could still be worth investigating to ensure that there's no tampering or malicious activity masquerading as Dism.exe.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity might be legitimate, the pattern of creating multiple executable files in the Temp directory by Dism.exe could be suspicious and warrant further investigation to confirm if it's part of a normal operation or an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involving the `Dism.exe` process creating multiple `.dll`, `.mui`, and `.exe` files in the Temp directory under a GUID path raises **moderate suspicion** but is not definitively malicious. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Tool**: `Dism.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for deployment and imaging tasks. It often generates temporary files during operations like system updates or image deployment.\n2. **File Types and Paths**:\n   - The files (e.g., `DismCore.dll`, `DismHost.exe`, `.mui` files) are common in Windows system operations.\n   - The Temp directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`) is a standard location for temporary files, and GUID-based subdirectories are typical for such operations.\n3. **Detection Rule**: The \"FileExecutableDetected\" rule may be overly broad, as `.dll` and `.mui` files are not traditionally considered \"executables\" (though `.dll` files can be loaded as code).\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n- **Unusual Volume of Executable Files**: While `Dism.exe` may create `.dll` files, the repeated detection of `.exe` files (e.g., `DismHost.exe`) in the Temp directory is atypical for normal `Dism` operations.\n- **Language-Specific Files**: The presence of `.mui` files (language resources) in the Temp directory is unusual unless explicitly part of a localized deployment task.\n- **Lack of Context**: No logs indicate user-initiated `Dism` commands or system updates, which could explain the activity.\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n- **Legitimate Deployment\/Update Activity**: If the system is undergoing a Windows Update, feature installation, or image deployment, the files may be part of a temporary package extraction.\n- **False Positive**: The detection rule may flag `.dll` files as \"executable\" due to misconfiguration, leading to unnecessary alerts.\n- **Malicious Activity**: If the files are not part of a known legitimate process, they could indicate tampering (e.g., a malicious actor exploiting `Dism.exe` to drop payloads in the Temp directory).\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with System Context**:\n   - Check if the system is running a legitimate `Dism`-related task (e.g., `DISM \/Image` commands, Windows Update).\n   - Verify if the user (`fiddelis`) has initiated such operations.\n2. **Analyze File Signatures**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **VirusTotal** to scan the files for malware signatures.\n   - Confirm if the files match known legitimate `Dism` components (e.g., `DismCore.dll` is part of the Windows Imaging Component).\n3. **Monitor for Persistence**:\n   - Check if the Temp directory files are being accessed or modified by other processes after creation.\n   - Look for unexpected registry changes or scheduled tasks linked to `Dism.exe`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** if tied to a known `Dism` operation. However, the lack of contextual evidence (e.g., user activity, system updates) and the unusual presence of `.exe` files in the Temp directory warrant **further investigation** to rule out false positives or malicious behavior. If no legitimate context is found, the event should be flagged for deeper analysis. \n\n**Final Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**, but not definitively malicious."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The events are all about files being detected as executable by Dism.exe. \n\nFirst, I remember that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing images. But sometimes, attackers might abuse it to execute malicious code. The files in question are all .dll.mui files in the Temp directory. MUI files are usually language-specific resources, but they can also be used to hide malicious code.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp folder, which is common for temporary files. However, having multiple .dll.mui files being detected as executables by Dism.exe might be suspicious. Legitimate use of Dism might involve some dlls, but typically not so many in the Temp directory. \n\nAlso, the fact that all these events are triggered by the same process, Dism.exe, and all have the same rule (FileExecutableDetected) suggests a pattern. If this is part of a normal system operation, maybe there's a legitimate reason, but the sheer number of files might indicate something else. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user is running a deployment or some imaging process that's legitimate. However, the presence of multiple .mui files being flagged as executables could be a red flag. MUI files are not typically executed directly; they're resources. So if the system is detecting them as executables, that might be an indicator of something wrong.\n\nI should also consider if there's any known malicious activity associated with these file names. The names like IBSProvider.dll.mui, ImagingProvider.dll.mui don't ring a bell as known malware, but that doesn't mean they're safe. It's possible that they're part of a legitimate setup, but the fact that they're in Temp and being executed by Dism could be a sign of an attack.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the system is just doing a normal update or deployment. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The key here is that the detection is happening multiple times, which might be more indicative of an issue than a single occurrence. \n\nSo, considering all that, the events are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. They might not be malicious on their own, but the pattern and location suggest that it's worth looking into to ensure there's no compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided events involve **Dism.exe** (a legitimate Windows tool for managing system images) detecting multiple **.dll.mui files** in the **AppData\\Local\\Temp** directory as executable. While this could be part of a legitimate system operation (e.g., deployment or imaging), the following red flags suggest further investigation is warranted:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concerns:**\n1. **Unusual File Types in Temp Folder**:\n   - `.dll.mui` files are typically **language-specific resource files** (not executable code). Their detection as executable by Dism.exe is atypical and may indicate **tampering** or **malicious use** of the file format.\n\n2. **High Volume of Files**:\n   - The presence of **15+ files** with similar naming patterns (e.g., `IBSProvider.dll.mui`, `VhdProvider.dll.mui`) in a short time frame raises suspicion of **automated activity** (e.g., malware droppers, persistence mechanisms).\n\n3. **Potential Abuse of Dism.exe**:\n   - Attackers sometimes abuse **Dism.exe** to execute malicious payloads (e.g., via `dism \/apply-image` or `dism \/export-image`). If these `.dll.mui` files are being used as **staged payloads**, this could be a **sign of compromise**.\n\n4. **Lack of Context**:\n   - No additional metadata (e.g., process tree, parent command line, file hashes) is provided to confirm whether this activity is **legitimate** (e.g., part of a Windows Update or sysprep operation) or **malicious**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n- **Analyze File Hashes**: Check the hashes of the `.dll.mui` files against threat intelligence databases (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to identify known malicious files.\n- **Review System Logs**: Look for correlated events (e.g., process creation, network connections, registry changes) around the time these files were detected.\n- **Monitor Dism.exe Usage**: Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals** to trace how Dism.exe is interacting with these files.\n- **Check for Persistence**: Investigate if these files are being used to establish **persistence** (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry keys).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile the activity is not definitively malicious, the **unusual file types, volume, and context** make this a **high-priority candidate for further investigation**. It could indicate either a **legitimate system operation** or a **potential compromise**."}

But Dism.exe is a valid process, and it's possible that it's executing these DLLs as part of its normal operations. However, the presence of multiple DLLs with similar naming patterns (like Provider.dll) might indicate that they are part of a legitimate component, such as those used during Windows deployment. \n\nBut then again, if these DLLs are not part of a known legitimate package, it could be a red flag. However, the user hasn't provided any additional context, like if this is during an installation or if the system is in a secure environment.

Since the files are in the Temp directory and are being executed by Dism.exe, which can be abused by attackers, this might be worth investigating. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that all these files are being detected as executables by the same process might be normal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule FileExecutableDetected is a custom one that's too sensitive, flagging legitimate files.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first two entries, both are about Dism.exe detecting files in the Temp directory. The files are VhdProvider.dll and WimProvider.dll. Normally, Dism.exe is part of Windows Deployment, used for imaging and deployment. But loading DLLs from the Temp folder might be suspicious because Temp is a common place for malware to hide.\n\nThen there's an event where DismHost.exe is created with a command line that includes a GUID. The path is in the same Temp directory. DismHost.exe is typically a host process for DISM, but the GUID in the command line might indicate some unexpected or custom operation.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, all from the same Temp directory. The DLLs include things like DismCorePS.dll, DismProv.dll, OSProvider.dll, etc. Some of these might be legitimate, but the fact that so many are loaded from Temp could be a red flag. Legitimate processes usually load DLLs from system directories or known locations, not Temp.\n\nNow, considering the combination of these events: multiple DLLs loaded from Temp by DismHost.exe, which was itself launched from Temp. This could indicate that an attacker is using DISM-related processes to execute malicious code. The use of Temp as a dropper for DLLs is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection. Also, the fact that the files are being loaded as part of a process that's typically used for system imaging might be a sign of exploitation or a malicious use of legitimate tools.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that DISM can sometimes generate temporary files during normal operations. But the number of DLLs loaded here seems excessive. Also, the presence of multiple Image Load events for different providers might not be standard. If this were a normal DISM operation, the DLLs would probably be from the system's installation directory, not the Temp folder.\n\nAnother point is the GUID in the command line. That's not typical for standard DISM commands. It might be part of a custom script or exploit. Also, the fact that the user is running these processes from Temp might indicate a lack of proper permissions or a compromised system.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of loading multiple DLLs from Temp, using DismHost.exe with a GUID in the command line, and the sheer number of Image Load events suggests a potential security threat. It's not definitive proof of malware, but it's suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the answer would be that this is interesting for investigation due to these suspicious patterns.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to several suspicious patterns that deviate from typical legitimate behavior associated with `DISM` (Windows Deployment Imaging and Management). Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual File Locations (Temp Directory):**\n   - Multiple files (e.g., `VhdProvider.dll`, `WimProvider.dll`, and numerous DLLs like `DismCorePS.dll`, `DismProv.dll`, etc.) are being loaded from the **`%TEMP%` directory**, which is a common location for malware to stage payloads or evade detection. Legitimate `DISM` operations typically use system or installation directories, not temporary folders.\n\n2. **Excessive Image Load Events:**\n   - **14+ `Image Load` events** for DLLs (e.g., `OSProvider.dll`, `AppxProvider.dll`, `OfflineSetupProvider.dll`) are logged. While `DISM` may use some of these providers, the **volume and variety** of DLLs loaded from the same Temp directory raise concerns. This could indicate a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate `DISM` operation.\n\n3. **Abnormal Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The `DismHost.exe` process is launched with a command line containing a **GUID (`{3A4A0A5B-...}`)**. This is **not typical** for standard `DISM` workflows, which usually involve commands like `Apply-Image` or `Mount-Wim`. The GUID may hint at a custom or obfuscated payload.\n\n4. **Lateral Movement or Persistence Risk:**\n   - Loading multiple DLLs from Temp could indicate **malware staging** (e.g., droppers, loaders) or **exploitation of a vulnerability** that allows execution via `DISM`-related processes. This could be an attempt to **bypass security controls** or **establish persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Behavior:**\n- **Legitimate Use:** `DISM` and `DismHost.exe` are used for Windows imaging, deployment, and system configuration. However, they typically operate in controlled environments (e.g., during OS installation or recovery).\n- **Malicious Use:** The combination of Temp-based execution, unusual command-line arguments, and excessive DLL loading suggests **potential abuse of legitimate tools** for malicious purposes (e.g., **DLL hijacking**, **exploiting misconfigurations**, or **stealthy payload delivery**).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the source** of the `DismHost.exe` process (e.g., check parent process, user context, and file hashes).\n- **Analyze the DLLs** in the Temp directory for signs of malicious content (e.g., YARA rules, entropy, or sandboxed behavior).\n- **Check for recent changes** to system files or registry keys related to `DISM` or `DismHost.exe`.\n- **Monitor for lateral movement** or unusual network activity originating from these processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events could theoretically be part of a legitimate `DISM` operation (though unlikely), the **unusual file locations, excessive DLL loading, and abnormal command-line arguments** strongly suggest **potential malicious activity**. This warrants further investigation to rule out exploitation, malware, or misconfigurations. \n\n**Classification:** 🚨 **High Priority for Investigation**."}

The first few entries mention DismHost.exe loading image files like SysprepProvider.dll and TransmogProvider.dll from the Temp directory. Then there's a process termination for DismHost.exe. \n\nNext, there are multiple entries from Dism.exe related to file deletions. The files being deleted are various DLLs and MUI files in the same Temp directory. One entry even mentions the file creation time changed for DismHost.exe, followed by its deletion.\n\nHmm, so the pattern here seems to be that DismHost.exe is loading some temporary DLLs, and then Dism.exe is deleting those files. But why is that suspicious? Well, Dism is a legitimate tool for deployment and imaging, but the fact that it's deleting so many files, especially from the Temp directory, might be part of a normal operation. However, the presence of multiple DLLs being loaded and then deleted could be a red flag. \n\nWait, but the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, so maybe this is just part of a normal process.

Also, the filenames like SysprepProvider.dll and TransmogProvider.dll aren't standard ones. Are those legitimate? I'm not sure, but they might be part of a custom script or could be malicious. \n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same Temp directory path. The fact that multiple files are being deleted from the same location might indicate that something is being cleaned up after an operation. However, without knowing the context of the system's activity, it's hard to say. \n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators.

But the sheer number of files deleted might raise an eyebrow. However, considering the nature of Dism and sysprep, it's probably okay. So, I think this is a legitimate process, so the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" but not necessarily malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The events involve the deletion of multiple provider DLLs (e.g., SysprepProvider.dll.mui, ImagingProvider.dll) by the Windows Deployment Imaging Service and Management (Dism.exe) process. These files are located in a temporary directory under a GUID-based folder, which is consistent with temporary files generated during system deployment or sysprep operations. While the deletion of such files is typical in post-deployment cleanup, the volume of deletions and the specific provider names warrant further investigation to confirm if this aligns with expected system behavior or indicates an unusual process.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a list of process events from a Windows system, probably from a SIEM or similar tool. My job is to analyze these events and explain what's happening, maybe detect any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry one by one. The first event is about 'sppsvc.exe' with the task 'Image loaded' and the file path 'taskschd.dll'. Sppsvc.exe is a legitimate Windows service related to software protection. Loading taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, so that seems normal. No red flags here.\n\nNext, 'svchost.exe' has a registry value set. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Changing registry values could be part of legitimate operations, but it's something to watch. Maybe a service is being configured, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' with 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is a common tool, but if it's being accessed multiple times, especially in a short period, that might be concerning. The next entry is another 'powershell.exe' with 'Registry value set'. Again, this could be part of normal operations, but if it's modifying critical registry keys, that's suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes: \"Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force\". This command is deleting a zip file named *entrada_principal.zip from the Temp directory. The use of wildcards might indicate the user is trying to delete multiple files, which could be part of cleaning up after an attack, like removing a payload. However, it's also possible that this is a legitimate cleanup action, but the lack of context makes it tricky.\n\nAnother PowerShell event shows 'Image loaded' with 'mscoree.dll' and 'clr.dll'. These are part of the .NET Framework, so loading them is normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET classes. No immediate issues here.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency and types of events. There are multiple PowerShell processes creating, accessing, and modifying registry values. This could be a sign of someone using PowerShell for malicious activities, like executing commands or modifying system settings. The deletion of the zip file might be an attempt to remove evidence, but again, without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI should also check if any of the processes are running under unexpected user accounts or if there are any unusual parent processes. However, the provided data doesn't include that information. The presence of multiple PowerShell events and registry modifications could be part of a larger attack chain, such as an attacker trying to maintain persistence or execute code.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the use of the 'Remove-Item' command with the '-Force' parameter. This could indicate that the user is trying to delete files that are normally protected or that the user has elevated privileges. If this is part of a script that's being run without proper authorization, it might be malicious.\n\nIn summary, while some of these events are normal, the repeated use of PowerShell for registry modifications and file deletions might indicate suspicious activity. It's worth investigating further by checking the context of these processes, user accounts involved, and correlating with other logs to determine if there's an actual security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of process and file-related events on a Windows system, with a focus on PowerShell activity. Here's a breakdown of the observed events and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Normal System Activity**\n- **`sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Service)**  \n  - **Event**: Image loaded (`taskschd.dll`).  \n  - **Analysis**: Legitimate process. `taskschd.dll` is part of the Task Scheduler, and `sppsvc.exe` is a standard Windows service. No suspicious behavior here.\n\n- **`svchost.exe` (Host Process for Windows Services)**  \n  - **Event**: Registry value set.  \n  - **Analysis**: Common for `svchost.exe` to modify registry keys as part of service management. No immediate red flags unless the registry change is to critical system keys.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell Activity**\n- **`powershell.exe` (Multiple Events)**  \n  - **Events Observed**:  \n    - **Process Create\/Access**: PowerShell is being executed and accessed multiple times.  \n    - **Registry Value Set**: PowerShell is modifying registry values.  \n    - **Image Load**: Loading `.NET` components (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which is normal for PowerShell scripts using .NET.  \n\n  - **Suspicious Command Line**:  \n    ```powershell\n    Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force\n    ```  \n    - **Analysis**: This command deletes all `.zip` files named `*entrada_principal.zip` from the Temp directory.  \n      - **Potential Concerns**:  \n        - **Wildcard Deletion**: Using `*` could indicate an attempt to delete multiple files, possibly to remove evidence (e.g., a malicious payload or log files).  \n        - **`-Force` Parameter**: Forces deletion of read-only files, which may suggest the user has elevated privileges or is bypassing system protections.  \n      - **Legitimate Use Case**: If the user is cleaning up temporary files, this could be normal. However, the lack of context (e.g., user account, source of the command) raises questions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Unusual Frequency of PowerShell Use**:  \n  - Multiple `powershell.exe` events (create, access, registry modification) could indicate an attacker using PowerShell for **post-exploitation tasks** (e.g., persistence, data exfiltration, or lateral movement).  \n\n- **File Deletion in Temp Directory**:  \n  - Deleting files from `$env:Temp` might be an attempt to **clean up after an attack** (e.g., removing a malicious script or payload).  \n\n- **Registry Modifications**:  \n  - If the registry changes are to keys like `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System`, they could be part of **malware persistence** (e.g., adding startup entries or modifying service configurations).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with User Accounts**:  \n   - Determine which user account executed the PowerShell commands. Unusual accounts (e.g., service accounts, guest accounts) or lack of proper authentication (e.g., no user context) could indicate a compromise.  \n\n2. **Check Parent Processes**:  \n   - Investigate the parent process of the PowerShell instances. If launched by an unexpected application (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe`, or a suspicious executable), this may point to malicious activity.  \n\n3. **Analyze File Contents**:  \n   - If the deleted `.zip` file was malicious, its contents might have been extracted or executed earlier. Check for logs related to file extraction, network traffic, or process injection.  \n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:  \n   - Look for additional PowerShell commands that could indicate **credential dumping**, **remote execution** (e.g., `Invoke-WmiMethod`, `Invoke-Command`), or **data exfiltration** (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`).  \n\n5. **Check for PowerShell Logging**:  \n   - Review PowerShell transcripts, event logs (`Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security`), or use tools like **PowerShell Transcript Analysis** to identify suspicious scripts.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Summary**\n- **Normal Activity**: Some events (e.g., `sppsvc.exe`, `.NET` image loading) are legitimate.  \n- **Suspicious Behavior**: Repeated PowerShell activity, registry modifications, and file deletion in the Temp directory may indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., cleanup after an attack).  \n- **Next Steps**: Investigate user context, parent processes, and correlate with other logs (e.g., network traffic, file system changes) to confirm if this is a security incident.\n\nIf this is part of a larger investigation, consider using tools like **SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack)**, **EDR (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)**, or **endpoint forensics** to trace the attacker's actions."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first few entries are about PowerShell loading images, like System.Management.Automation.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll. These are legitimate files, especially since MpOAV and MpClient are part of Windows Defender. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1, which is then deleted. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting a temporary script might be part of an attack, like executing malicious code and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there are entries about registry value set and process accessed, but no files involved. Then, multiple instances of PowerShell commands with ExecutionPolicy Restricted. The commands are simple like Write-Host, which is benign, but there's a more complex script that checks INF files for certain patterns. The script is looking for defaultinstall sections in INF files, which might be related to checking for driver installations or other system changes. However, the fact that this is done via PowerShell with Restricted policy might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, the ExecutionPolicy Restricted is actually a security feature that prevents running scripts unless they're signed or allowed. If the script is being run under Restricted policy, maybe it's a legitimate check, but the repeated execution and the specific INF checking could be part of a malicious process. Also, the creation and deletion of the temp script might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces.\n\nHowever, some of the events are normal, like loading legitimate DLLs. The key here is the combination of events. The creation and deletion of the script, along with the INF checking, might indicate a script that's probing the system for vulnerabilities or checking for certain configurations. But is that enough to be classified as interesting? \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's some suspicious activity, but not definitive proof of malicious intent. The presence of both legitimate and potentially suspicious events makes it a bit ambiguous. However, the combination of creating a temp script, deleting it, and running a script that checks system files might be worth investigating further. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.65. The justification would be the creation and deletion of a temporary script and the execution of a script that checks system INF files, which could be indicative of reconnaissance or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show creation\/deletion of temporary scripts and loading of system files, which may indicate script-based reconnaissance or evasion techniques. The INF file scanning command could be probing for system configuration details.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all related to PowerShell commands. The first thing I notice is that there are two distinct PowerShell commands being executed repeatedly.\n\nThe first command is a script that checks INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns related to different architectures (like amd64, x86, etc.). The script is looking for sections named [defaultinstall.nt...], which might be part of a setup or installation process. The presence of these sections could indicate something like a driver installation or a system configuration change. Since this is being done with PowerShell and the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, that might be a red flag because normally, Restricted policy would prevent scripts from running unless they're signed or allowed. But maybe the user is bypassing that somehow.\n\nThen there's another set of commands that are removing ZIP files from the Temp directory. The pattern here is *entrada_principal.zip, which suggests they're cleaning up after extracting something. But why would someone remove these files? It could be part of a normal process, but combined with the first command, it might be more suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the winlog task fields: some are 'Provider Lifecycle' and others 'Engine Lifecycle'. Not sure what those exactly mean, but maybe they're related to different parts of the system or different services. However, the repetition of the same commands across multiple events might indicate automation or a script that's running multiple times. \n\nThe key thing here is that the first command is scanning INF files for specific installation sections. INF files are used in Windows for installing drivers and other system components. If an attacker is looking for these sections, maybe they're trying to find existing installations or modify them. The fact that this command is run multiple times could suggest that the attacker is checking for the presence of certain configurations or trying to detect if a system is vulnerable.\n\nThe second command is deleting ZIP files, which might be part of a cleanup after deploying or extracting malicious payloads. But without seeing the contents of those ZIP files, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of scanning for INF files and then cleaning up ZIP files might be part of a larger attack chain. For example, the attacker could be checking for existing installations (INF files) and then removing any temporary files (ZIPs) after deploying their payload.\n\nAnother point is the use of PowerShell with Restricted ExecutionPolicy. Normally, Restricted would prevent scripts from running unless they're signed or come from a trusted source. If the user is running this script, maybe they've bypassed the policy, which is a security risk. However, the presence of the command line in the logs might be due to legitimate administrative tasks, but the pattern here is more indicative of something malicious.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the repeated scanning of INF files for specific sections and the deletion of ZIP files in the Temp directory could be part of an attempt to modify system configurations or install malicious software. Therefore, this batch of events seems suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell commands scanning INF files for architecture-specific installation sections and deleting temporary ZIP files, suggesting potential system enumeration or cleanup after deployment. The combination of these actions may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
