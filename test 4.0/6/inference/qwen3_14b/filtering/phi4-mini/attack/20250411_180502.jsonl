{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe with network connections detected. That's normal, right? Chrome often connects to the internet, so unless there's something suspicious about the destination, these might be benign. But I should note that there are several of them, maybe indicating a lot of network activity, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe with various events. The first ones are registry value set events. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Setting registry values could be part of normal operations, but sometimes malware uses the registry to persist. However, just setting registry values isn't necessarily bad.\n\nLooking further, there are image loaded events for PowerShell. The paths mentioned are all standard Windows system files like mscoreei.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. These are legitimate files, so loading them is normal. No red flags here.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script with a name that looks like a random string. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of normal operations, but sometimes malware uses temporary files to execute malicious code. However, since it's deleted afterward, it might be a cleanup step. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, there are several process start commands via PowerShell, using Start-Process with various batch files. The paths here are a bit concerning. They have a pattern where the path includes \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. For example, \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\unidade_comum\\\\..\\\\estrutura_ativo\\\\estrutura_geral_script.bat\". The \"..\\\\\" suggests moving up a directory, which might be a way to obfuscate the actual path. This could be a red flag because attackers sometimes use such paths to hide the real location of the script or to bypass certain security checks.\n\nLooking at the names of the batch files, they all end with \"_script.bat\". That's a bit unusual. While some legitimate scripts might have such names, it's also a common naming convention used in malicious scripts. The use of multiple such scripts being executed through PowerShell could indicate automated or scripted attacks.\n\nAlso, there are entries for ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe with registry events. These are typically legitimate processes, so their registry activity might be normal. However, if they're doing unexpected things, it could be a problem, but the logs don't show anything out of the ordinary here.\n\nThe last entry is another image loaded event for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That's definitely legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of the events are normal, but the PowerShell activities with the directory traversal in the paths and the repeated execution of scripts named \"_script.bat\" stand out. The use of \"..\\\" in the paths might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual script location. While this could be a false positive, the combination of these events, especially the repeated use of Start-Process with obfuscated paths, raises suspicion. It's possible that this is part of a malicious activity, such as executing a script that's hidden in a parent directory to avoid detection. However, without more context or additional suspicious activities, it's a bit of a judgment call. But given the patterns observed, it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **Chrome Network Connections**: Multiple entries for `chrome.exe` with \"Network connection detected\" are typical for web browsing and likely benign.\n2. **Legitimate System Files**: PowerShell loading standard system files (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`) is expected and not inherently malicious.\n3. **Standard Processes**: Registry modifications by `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` and `Calculator.exe` are consistent with normal Windows operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Obfuscated File Paths**:\n   - PowerShell commands use paths with `..\\\" (e.g., `C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\unidade_comum\\\\..\\\\estrutura_ativo\\\\estrutura_geral_script.bat`). This directory traversal could be an attempt to **obfuscate the true location** of the script or bypass path-based security checks.\n   - The naming pattern (`_script.bat`) is common in malicious scripts and may indicate **automated or scripted attacks**.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`entrada_base_script.bat`) is created and deleted in the `Temp` directory. While temporary files are common, this behavior could be part of **malware execution or cleanup**.\n\n3. **Repetitive PowerShell Execution**:\n   - Multiple `Start-Process` commands execute batch files via PowerShell. This pattern may suggest **scripted attacks** or **lateral movement** if the scripts perform unauthorized actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**: The majority of events are benign, but the obfuscated paths, repetitive script execution, and temporary file handling raise **red flags**. These could indicate **malware activity**, **exploitation**, or **post-compromise operations**.\n- **Context Needed**: Further investigation (e.g., analyzing the content of deleted scripts, checking for anomalous network traffic, or correlating with other logs) is required to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Deleted Script**: Recover or analyze the contents of `entrada_base_script.bat` (if possible) to determine its purpose.\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Activity**: Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **EDR solutions** to detect unusual script execution.\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**: Investigate if the batch files are part of a **chain of attacks** or **credential dumping**.\n4. **Review File Integrity**: Ensure files like `estrutura_geral_script.bat` are not malicious (e.g., via hash analysis or sandboxing).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile not definitively malicious, the **obfuscated paths**, **repetitive PowerShell use**, and **temporary script handling** warrant **further investigation**. These patterns are consistent with **malicious activity** and should be prioritized for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look at all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity from chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and others. The main events are related to registry changes, file creations, and image loading. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the use of PowerShell. There's an entry where powershell.exe loads the urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL, but that's not suspicious on its own. However, there's also a file created in the user's Downloads folder named \"componente_principal.txt\" by PowerShell. That could be normal, but I need to check for any unusual patterns.\n\nAnother point is the cmd.exe process running a batch file from \"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". The path here has some non-English characters (\"entrada_ativo\" might be Portuguese for \"input active\"), which could be a red flag if this is unexpected in the environment. If the system is supposed to have Portuguese names, maybe not, but if it's a mix of languages or unexpected paths, that might be suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events by chrome.exe and other processes. While registry changes are common, having so many from chrome.exe might be unusual. However, Chrome does modify the registry for its own settings, so that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are legitimate. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. However, if these were loaded from unexpected paths, that could be a problem, but the paths here are standard.\n\nThe file created by svchost.exe in the DeliveryOptimization folder is part of Windows Update, so that's normal. The PowerShell-created file in Downloads might be benign, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, the batch file execution, and the use of PowerShell could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or execute scripts.\n\nBut wait, there's also a lot of \"Registry value set\" events. If an attacker is trying to persist, they might modify registry keys. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious registry keys being set. The events are just indicating that values were set, not what the values are. So without more details, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of \"Pipe Created\" by chrome.exe. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, and while Chrome might use them, if there's a lot of pipe creation from an unexpected process, that could be a sign of something. But again, Chrome is a common process, so this might not be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious points are the batch file execution from a non-standard path and the multiple registry changes. However, without more context on what the batch file does or the specific registry keys modified, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence here would be moderate. It's not clearly malicious, but there are enough anomalies that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe and PowerShell, combined with a suspicious batch file execution from a non-standard path, suggest potential system manipulation or script-based activity warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll look at each event.\n\nAll the first four entries are about chrome.exe performing a registry value set. That's a common activity, but maybe if it's happening multiple times, it could be suspicious. However, Chrome does interact with the registry, so maybe it's normal. But then again, if it's setting registry values in a way that's not typical, that might be a problem.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The path seems to be in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for such files. The .yml.new file might be a temporary file during setup, which is normal.\n\nAnother entry is powershell.exe creating a file called elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily malicious. However, the name is generic. But without more context, like the content of the file or other actions, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at all events together, the main thing is that there's a lot of registry changes by Chrome, but Chrome is a legitimate application. The other events are about file creation, which are also common. However, the repetition of the same event (chrome.exe setting registry values) multiple times might be worth looking into. But unless there's a pattern that's abnormal, like unexpected registry keys being modified, it might not be a big deal.\n\nI should check if there's any indicator of compromise here. For example, if the registry changes are related to persistence or modifying Chrome's behavior. But the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed. The same goes for the file creations. Without more details, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering that all events are from legitimate processes (Chrome, winlogbeat, PowerShell), and the actions are typical for those processes, the batch might not be interesting. However, the repetition of the same event four times could indicate something, but maybe it's just a normal operation that's logged multiple times.\n\nSo, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious activity indicated. The justification would be that the events involve normal processes performing typical actions without any obvious signs of compromise. The confidence is medium, maybe around 0.6, because while the repetition is a bit odd, without more context, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve normal processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing typical actions (registry updates, file creation) without indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
