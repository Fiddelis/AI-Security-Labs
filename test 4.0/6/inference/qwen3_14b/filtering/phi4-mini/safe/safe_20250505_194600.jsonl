Then there's notepad.exe loading urlmon.dllâ€”urlmon is part of Windows, so that's probably legitimate. Services.exe logging on is normal too.\n\nNext, MpDefenderCoreService.exe has a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so that's expected. Then notepad.exe creates a file in the Downloads folder. Creating files there is common, like when users save documents. The same event repeats twice, which might be a log duplication, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creates a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. The same event is logged twice again, maybe due to logging issues.\n\nThere's a registry value set by notepad.exe and Explorer.EXE. Registry changes can be risky, but if they're part of normal operations, like saving settings, it's okay. The process create event for notepad opening the arquivo.txt file is standard.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's no unusual process behavior, no unexpected network activity, and all file operations are in typical locations. The repetition of some logs might be a red herring, but nothing here indicates a security threat. So, this batch doesn't seem interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal system operations (e.g., legitimate process executions, standard file creation in user directories, and routine registry modifications). No suspicious patterns or security-relevant anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
