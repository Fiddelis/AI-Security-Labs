{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the logs here are about files being created, specifically by a process called SDXHelper.exe. The files are all named similarly, with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a long hash. They're located in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. Now, I know that sometimes legitimate software uses such naming conventions, especially for resources or compiled files. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times might be a red flag. Wait, looking again, some of the files are created multiple times. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js\" appears twice. But maybe that's just part of the normal process, like updates or installations.\n\nAnother thing to note is that SDXHelper.exe is mentioned in several entries. I should check if this is a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft's Software Development Kit (SDK) or possibly part of some Office tools. However, if this process is creating a lot of JavaScript files in the Office directory, that might be unusual. JavaScript files in that location could indicate some kind of injection or malicious activity, but I need to be careful here. It could also be part of a legitimate application's resources.\n\nThere's also one entry that's different: the log with the task \"Security Group Management\" and no process or file information. That might be a separate event, possibly related to user account management. But since the rest of the logs are about file creation, maybe that's a red herring or unrelated.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of malware. Malware often creates files with random names, especially if they're trying to avoid detection. However, the naming here is consistent, which might suggest it's part of a legitimate installation. But the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate that the process is being repeated unnecessarily, which might be a sign of something wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be using a tool that's generating these files as part of its normal operation. For example, if there's a software that's compiling or minifying JavaScript files, it might do that in a temporary directory. However, the location here is under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages, which is not a typical place for such activities. That could be a sign that something is out of place.\n\nI should also check if there are any known malicious activities associated with SDXHelper.exe. A quick search in my mind (since I can't browse the internet) tells me that SDXHelper is sometimes associated with legitimate Microsoft tools, but it's also been seen in some malware contexts. However, without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of events are file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location, with repetitive filenames. This could be either a legitimate process or a potential security threat. Since the logs don't show any obvious signs of compromise (like unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, etc.), but the location and frequency of file creation are suspicious, it's worth flagging for further investigation. The presence of the \"Security Group Management\" event is separate and might not be related, but it's still a point to consider. However, the main concern here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper in the Office directory, which is not typical. Therefore, this batch of logs is interesting and should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a pattern of activity that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - **Unusual Location:** The files are created in a Microsoft Office-related directory, which is not typical for JavaScript files. This could indicate either:\n     - **Legitimate Activity:** If `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a software development or deployment tool (e.g., SDK, Office add-ins), but the repetitive nature raises concerns.\n     - **Malicious Activity:** The filenames and location may mimic legitimate processes, but the repetition and lack of clear purpose could suggest data injection, resource generation, or exploitation.\n\n2. **Repetition of File Names:**\n   - Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js`) are created multiple times. This could indicate redundant operations or a process attempting to bypass detection.\n\n3. **Isolated \"Security Group Management\" Event:**\n   - A single log entry mentions \"Security Group Management\" with no process or file details. This is unrelated to the rest of the logs but may indicate a separate administrative or authentication event.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- **Unusual Behavior:** The combination of `SDXHelper.exe` (a process often tied to software development or Microsoft tools) creating JavaScript files in an Office directory is atypical. This could signal:\n  - **Malware:** If the files are malicious payloads or part of a data exfiltration attempt.\n  - **Compromise:** A legitimate process being exploited to generate files for nefarious purposes (e.g., persistence, command-and-control communication).\n\n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional logs (e.g., network activity, process tree, user context), it is challenging to determine whether this is benign or malicious.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- **Investigate Further:**\n  - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process (e.g., via file reputation, digital signatures, or system integrity checks).\n  - Analyze the contents of the created files (if accessible) for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, embedded payloads).\n  - Correlate with network logs to identify any unusual outbound traffic or communication.\n  - Monitor user activity to determine if the process was initiated by an authorized user or through a compromised account.\n\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - If the process is suspicious, block or quarantine `SDXHelper.exe` and remove the created files.\n  - Conduct a full system scan for malware and ensure all software is up to date.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs exhibit behavior that is **potentially suspicious** due to the unusual file creation patterns and location. While not definitively malicious, this warrants **further investigation** to rule out compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of system events, mostly from the SDXHelper.exe process creating multiple JavaScript files in a specific directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. There's also one event from chrome.exe setting a registry value. The task is to determine if this is suspicious or normal behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not sure what that is. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's a known legitimate process. If I can't find information on it, that might be a red flag. Then, looking at the file creation: all the files are JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages folder. Office usually stores add-ins or solutions, but creating so many JS files might be unusual. Typically, Office solutions might have a few files, but dozens? That could be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or a downloader.\n\nAlso, the filenames are all similar, with different hashes or identifiers. That might be a way to obfuscate the files. The repetition of some filenames (like the ones with min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js appearing twice) could indicate that the process is trying to create duplicates, maybe to avoid detection or to overwrite existing files. \n\nThen there's the registry event from chrome.exe. Setting a registry value isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, that could be concerning. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe Chrome is just updating some settings, but if this is the only event from Chrome, it might not be significant.\n\nAnother point is the number of events. There are 19 entries, most of them from SDXHelper.exe. The fact that it's creating so many files in a short period could be indicative of malicious activity, like generating payloads or preparing for an attack. However, if this is part of a legitimate software's update process, it might be normal. But I don't recall any legitimate software that would create so many JS files in the Office directory.\n\nI should also consider the user's environment. If this is on a system that's supposed to have Office installed, but SDXHelper.exe isn't a known component, that's a problem. Maybe the user is using some third-party add-in or tool that's causing this. Alternatively, it could be malware masquerading as a legitimate process.\n\nIn summary, the key red flags here are: the high volume of file creations by an unknown process (SDXHelper.exe), the nature of the files (JavaScript in Office directories), and the repetition of filenames. The registry event from Chrome might be a separate issue but not directly related unless there's more context. Without knowing more about SDXHelper.exe, it's safer to consider this suspicious. The user should investigate further by checking the process's origin, verifying its legitimacy, and scanning for malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described are **potentially suspicious** and warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual File Creation by SDXHelper.exe**\n- **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a well-known or widely recognized legitimate process. While it could be part of a specific application, its name does not align with standard Microsoft Office components or common software.\n- **File Behavior**:\n  - **High Volume**: The process creates **19 JavaScript files** (`*.min.js`) in the directory `C:\\Users\\{user}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`. Creating **multiple files with unique hashes** in a short time is highly unusual for legitimate software.\n  - **File Naming**: The filenames follow a pattern (`min_<hash>.js`), which is common in obfuscated or malicious payloads (e.g., malware droppers, loaders, or packers).\n  - **Repetition**: Some files are duplicated (e.g., `min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js` appears twice). This could indicate attempts to **overwrite files** or **avoid detection** by creating redundant entries.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Location of Files**\n- **Office SolutionPackages Directory**: This directory is typically used for **Office add-ins** (e.g., COM add-ins, VSTO solutions). However, **JavaScript files** are not standard in this context. Legitimate Office solutions usually involve `.dll`, `.exe`, or `.manifest` files, not `.js` files.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Malicious Indicators**\n- **Malware Behavior**: The pattern of creating numerous `.js` files in a non-standard location with obfuscated names is consistent with **malware behavior** (e.g., droppers, loaders, or scripts that execute payloads).\n- **Lack of Transparency**: No known legitimate software is associated with `SDXHelper.exe` or the described file-creation activity. This lack of transparency raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Chrome.exe Registry Event**\n- **Registry Modification**: The single event from `chrome.exe` setting a registry value is **not inherently suspicious**. However, if this is the **only Chrome-related activity** and unrelated to other events, it may be unrelated to the broader pattern of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., is it in a legitimate directory like `C:\\Program Files` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`?).\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **VirusTotal** to scan the file.\n   - Check the **digital signature** (if any) and verify it against trusted sources.\n\n2. **Analyze the JavaScript Files**:\n   - Open the `.min.js` files in a text editor or deobfuscation tool to inspect their contents.\n   - Look for **malicious code patterns** (e.g., base64-encoded payloads, obfuscated JavaScript, or references to external domains).\n\n3. **Check for Network Activity**:\n   - Monitor if `SDXHelper.exe` or the created `.js` files communicate with **external IPs** or **malicious domains** (e.g., via DNS, HTTP, or other protocols).\n\n4. **System Integrity Check**:\n   - Run a full system scan with **antivirus software** and check for **unauthorized modifications** to the registry or file system.\n\n5. **Isolate the System**:\n   - If this is a corporate or sensitive system, isolate it from the network until the issue is resolved.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity described is **highly suspicious** and likely indicative of **malware** or **unauthorized software**. The combination of an unknown process (`SDXHelper.exe`), the creation of numerous `.js` files in a non-standard location, and the lack of transparency strongly suggests a potential security threat. Immediate investigation and mitigation are recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating a lot of files with names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by some random-looking hexadecimal strings. The task is to figure out if this is a security threat or just normal activity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that sometimes legitimate software uses helper processes, but sometimes malware does too. The file names are all similar, which might indicate they're part of the same application. However, the fact that there are so many files being created could be a red flag. Malware often generates a lot of files with obfuscated names to avoid detection.\n\nNext, looking at the structure of the file names: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\". The \"strings\" part might be related to localization or resource files, but the \"min\" could stand for \"minified\" if they're JavaScript files. However, the presence of a lot of these files in a specific directory might be unusual. If this is part of a legitimate application, maybe it's updating resources, but typically, such updates wouldn't create so many files in the user's AppData directory.\n\nAnother thing to check is the directory where these files are being created. The path is \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\", which is a common location for user-specific data. However, if this is a legitimate process, it might be part of an Office add-in or a service. But the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could indicate that the process is generating these files dynamically, which might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that the same file is being created multiple times (like \"min_9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be.js\" appearing twice) could be a sign of redundancy or attempted overwriting, which might be suspicious. Malware sometimes creates multiple instances of the same file to avoid detection or to increase the chances of persistence.\n\nI should also consider the context of the system. If the user hasn't installed any new software recently, this activity could be unexpected. Checking the process's digital signature might help. If SDXHelper.exe is signed by a legitimate company, it's more likely to be safe. However, if it's unsigned or signed by an unknown entity, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother angle is to look for any network activity associated with SDXHelper.exe. If it's communicating with unknown servers, that's a strong indicator of malware. Also, checking the system's Task Manager for any unusual CPU or memory usage by SDXHelper.exe could provide clues.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the high volume of files created, the naming pattern which might be obfuscated, the repetition of file names, and the potential lack of a known legitimate source for SDXHelper.exe. These factors together might suggest a security threat, but without more information like the process's origin, signatures, or network behavior, it's hard to be certain. The user should investigate further by checking the process's details, running a malware scan, and possibly consulting with cybersecurity experts.\n<\/think>\n\nThe activity described, involving **SDXHelper.exe** creating numerous files with obfuscated names (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hex>`), raises **significant security concerns** and warrants investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicious Activity**\n1. **High Volume of Files Created**  \n   - Over **20+ files** with similar naming patterns in a short time. Legitimate applications typically do not generate this many files dynamically in user directories like `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`.\n\n2. **Obfuscated File Names**  \n   - The use of hex strings (e.g., `9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be`) suggests **obfuscation**, a common tactic in malware to evade detection.\n\n3. **Repetition of File Names**  \n   - Files like `min_9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be.js` are created **twice**, which may indicate **redundant operations** or attempts to persist data.\n\n4. **Unusual Directory Location**  \n   - Files are being written to `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`, a location often targeted by malware for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n1. **Legitimate Activity (Unlikely)**  \n   - **Office Add-ins\/Extensions**: While Office applications may use helper processes, they typically do not generate hundreds of minified resource files dynamically.  \n   - **Update Processes**: If this is part of a software update, the files would likely be transient and not duplicated.\n\n2. **Malware (High Probability)**  \n   - **Persistence Mechanism**: The files could be part of a **dropper** or **loader** that executes malicious code upon system boot or user interaction.  \n   - **Data Exfiltration**: The hex-named files might contain **encrypted payloads**, logs, or stolen data.  \n   - **Command-and-Control (C2) Communication**: The process may be communicating with a remote server (check network activity in Task Manager or firewall logs).\n\n3. **False Positive (Remote Possibility)**  \n   - If **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate process (e.g., part of a software suite), the files could be **temporary resources**. However, this is rare and would require verification of the process's **digital signature** and **publisher**.\n\n---\n\n### **Immediate Actions to Take**\n1. **Check Process Details**  \n   - Open **Task Manager**, right-click **SDXHelper.exe**, and select **\"Open file location\"** to inspect the executable.  \n   - Verify the **digital signature** (right-click > **Properties** > **Digital Signatures tab**). Legitimate software will have a trusted publisher.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**  \n   - Run a full system scan using **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to detect potential threats.\n\n3. **Monitor Network Traffic**  \n   - Use **Wireshark** or the **Windows Firewall** to check if the process is communicating with unknown IP addresses or domains.\n\n4. **Isolate and Analyze Files**  \n   - If the files are not being used by any known application, delete them and monitor for re-creation.  \n   - Analyze file contents (e.g., using a hex editor or VirusTotal) to check for malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Check System Logs**  \n   - Review **Event Viewer** (Windows Logs > Security) for suspicious events (e.g., process creation, file access) associated with `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe behavior observed is **highly suspicious** and strongly indicative of **malware** or **malicious activity**. While further investigation is needed, the combination of obfuscated file names, high volume of files, and unusual directory placement suggests a threat. **Do not ignore this activity**—take immediate steps to isolate the process and scan the system. If the process is confirmed malicious, remove it and consider contacting a cybersecurity professional for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is suspicious. So, first, I'll scan through the entries.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. There are a bunch of JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js. The same file is created multiple times, even with the same hash. That repetition might be a red flag. Also, the fact that they're all minified JS could mean they're obfuscated, which is common in malware.\n\nThen there's one event from chrome.exe where a registry value is set. But chrome.exe is a legitimate process, so that might not be suspicious on its own. However, if there's a lot of registry changes, that could be an issue. But here, it's just one event.\n\nAnother thing to note is the path where the files are created. The Office SolutionPackages directory is part of Microsoft Office, so if a legitimate process like SDXHelper.exe is creating files there, maybe that's normal. But if the files are malicious, they might be trying to hide in a legitimate directory.\n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe – I should check if that's a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, specifically for handling add-ins or solutions. So, if it's creating these JS files, maybe it's part of some legitimate operation. But the repetition of the same file name might indicate something else. Maybe a failed attempt to overwrite or a loop?\n\nAlso, the fact that the same file is created twice with the same name and hash could be an error or an attempt to inject code. But without more context, like the content of the files or other processes involved, it's hard to tell. However, the sheer number of files created by SDXHelper might be unusual. Typically, you might expect a few files, not dozens.\n\nAnother angle: the registry event. If chrome.exe is setting a registry value, but there's no other activity related to that, maybe it's harmless. But if combined with the file creations, it could be part of a larger attack. However, without more data, it's speculative.\n\nIn threat hunting, a high number of file creations in a short time by a single process, especially with obfuscated names, can be a sign of malicious activity. Also, the repetition of the same file might indicate a problem. But since SDXHelper is a legitimate process, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate operation, like updating or deploying add-ins.\n\nBut the user is asking if this is suspicious. Given the context, I think the key points are the large number of files, the repetition, and the obfuscated names. Even though the process is legitimate, the behavior might be out of the ordinary. So, I'd lean towards this being suspicious and warranting further investigation, like checking the file contents, looking at the process's parent, and seeing if there are any network connections or other anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events described exhibits several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators and their implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**\n- **Observation**: `SDXHelper.exe` (a process associated with Microsoft Office) creates **multiple JavaScript files** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js`) in the `Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. The same file is created **multiple times** (e.g., two entries for `min_e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182.js`).\n- **Suspiciousness**:\n  - **Unusual volume**: Creating **14+ files** in a short period is atypical for legitimate Office operations.\n  - **Repetition**: The same file being created **multiple times** may indicate a loop, failed overwrite attempt, or malicious behavior (e.g., injecting code).\n  - **Obfuscation**: The filenames use obfuscated hashes (`min_...js`), which is common in malware to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **2. `chrome.exe` Registry Modification**\n- **Observation**: A single event logs a **registry value set** by `chrome.exe`.\n- **Suspiciousness**:\n  - While `chrome.exe` is a legitimate process, **unusual registry modifications** (especially without accompanying file activity) could indicate **malware persistence** or **tampering**.\n  - No other events link this registry change to the `SDXHelper.exe` activity, making it unclear if it’s related.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Contextual Red Flags**\n- **Legitimate Process, Unusual Behavior**: `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Office process, but **abnormal file creation patterns** (e.g., obfuscated filenames, repetition) could signal **exploitation** (e.g., malicious add-ins or DLL hijacking).\n- **Lack of Context**: No additional details (e.g., process parentage, network activity, file contents) are provided, making it difficult to confirm benignity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate File Contents**:\n   - Analyze the contents of the JavaScript files (e.g., check for obfuscation, embedded payloads, or references to malicious domains).\n2. **Check Process Parentage**:\n   - Verify if `SDXHelper.exe` was spawned by a legitimate Office process or a suspicious third-party application.\n3. **Monitor Network Activity**:\n   - Look for unusual outbound connections (e.g., to C2 servers) from the affected system.\n4. **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence**:\n   - Check if the hashes of the created files appear in malware repositories (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process, the **abnormal volume and repetition of file creation**, combined with **obfuscated filenames**, raise **strong suspicion of malicious activity**. This warrants immediate investigation to rule out exploitation, malware deployment, or persistence mechanisms."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze the batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate system file, part of Windows, so that's normal. Then there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min... These look like they might be part of some Office add-in or solution package. But why are they being created repeatedly? Maybe it's a normal part of Office's operation, but I should check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nNext, chrome.exe is loading Windows Defender DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's also legitimate, as Chrome might interact with Defender. Then there are several registry value set events by chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag if done by a browser, but maybe it's related to some extension or user settings. However, repeated registry changes might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the file creation events for the Excel file \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and its Zone.Identifier streams. Zone.Identifier is used by Windows to mark files downloaded from the internet, so that's normal. But there are multiple entries about creating the same file and its streams. Maybe the file was downloaded multiple times, but that's not necessarily suspicious.\n\nNow, the SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office package directory. The names are similar, and they're all minified. Minified files are common in legitimate software, but if there's a lot of them, maybe it's part of a larger package. However, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Office, so that's probably okay. But creating so many files might be unusual.\n\nThe repeated FileCreate events for the same JavaScript files might indicate that the system is trying to update or install something, but if it's all part of a legitimate Office update, then it's fine. However, if these files are being created in unusual locations or by unexpected processes, that's a problem.\n\nThe registry changes by chrome.exe are a bit concerning. If a browser is modifying the registry, it might be due to extensions, but if it's not related to any known extension, that could be a sign of a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of the events seem to be related to legitimate processes like Chrome and Office. However, the multiple file creations by SDXHelper and the registry changes by Chrome might warrant further investigation. There's no obvious malware here, but the repetition and the specific files could be indicative of something. Maybe it's a false positive, but to be safe, marking this as interesting for investigation makes sense.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of legitimate system activity and potential indicators of interest. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Activity:**\n   - **`chrome.exe` loading system DLLs** (e.g., `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`): These are standard Windows components, and their loading by Chrome is typical for browser interactions with system processes or security tools like Windows Defender.\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files** in Microsoft Office's `SolutionPackages` directory: These files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) resemble minified JavaScript used in legitimate Office add-ins or localization packages. Their repetitive creation could indicate an update or installation process.\n\n2. **Potential Anomalies:**\n   - **Repeated File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:** The same JavaScript files are created multiple times in the same directory. While this could be part of an update or caching mechanism, it raises questions about whether the process is operating within expected parameters (e.g., unnecessary duplication, lack of versioning).\n   - **Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`:** Multiple `Registry value set` events by Chrome are unusual. While Chrome extensions can modify the registry, repeated changes without clear context (e.g., no associated extension activity) could hint at tampering or unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **File Streams and Downloads:**\n   - The repeated creation of `Zone.Identifier` streams for the Excel file `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` is normal for downloaded files. However, the frequency of these events (multiple entries for the same file) might suggest repeated downloads or interactions with the file, which could be benign or indicative of user behavior requiring further scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** Low to moderate. No direct evidence of malware (e.g., unknown processes, network activity, or suspicious file hashes). However, the repetitive file creation and registry changes are atypical and warrant closer examination.\n- **False Positive Risk:** High. Legitimate processes (Chrome, Office) could generate these events during updates, installations, or user interactions. Context (e.g., user behavior, system state) is needed to confirm benignity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Investigate Further:** \n  - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft process (e.g., part of Office or Windows Update).\n  - Audit registry changes made by Chrome to determine their purpose (e.g., extension-related or user-initiated).\n  - Verify the integrity of the JavaScript files (e.g., hash comparisons, source analysis).\n- **Monitor for Patterns:** Track if similar activity recurs, as it could signal persistent behavior (e.g., a background process or stealthy installation).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events are not overtly malicious, the repetitive file creation and registry modifications by trusted processes merit investigation to rule out anomalies or unintended behavior. **This batch is interesting for further analysis** but not definitively suspicious at this stage."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit suspicious because it's in the AppData folder, which is common for user-specific files, but the name of the file is a long hash. That might be a normal Office package file, but I should check if there are other events that stand out.\n\nNext, EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are all legitimate system DLLs used by Excel for various functions like .NET support, anti-malware scanning, and URL handling. So far, nothing too suspicious here.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe setting registry values. That's normal for system services, so probably not an issue. The same with HxTsr.exe setting registry values. HxTsr is related to Microsoft Office, so that might be part of normal operations.\n\nLooking at the files created by SDXHelper.exe again, they're all UI string JSON files in different languages. The filenames have language codes and hashes. These could be part of Office's localization resources. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files in the SolutionPackages directory might be normal, but I need to check if there's any unusual activity.\n\nWait, there's also an event where EXCEL.EXE creates a file stream in a Temp directory with a filename that's a hash. That might be a temporary file created during processing, which is normal. But the presence of multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in different language directories might be worth checking. Are these files expected? If they're part of a legitimate Office update or package, then it's okay. But if they're being created in an unusual manner or from an unexpected source, that could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is involved in creating these files. Is that a known legitimate process? SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the Office Add-ins or Solution Packages. So that's probably legitimate. However, the number of files created might be higher than usual, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing to note is that EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, which is normal. However, if there were any unexpected DLLs or if the same DLL was loaded multiple times in an unusual way, that could be a sign. But in this case, the DLLs are standard.\n\nThe registry changes by svchost and HxTsr are also standard for system processes. So, no obvious signs of malware here.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. The key here is whether there's any activity that's out of the ordinary. The creation of multiple files with hash names in the SolutionPackages directory by SDXHelper.exe might be normal, but if this is part of a larger pattern or if there are other events that are not shown here, it could be a concern. However, based solely on the provided data, these events seem to be part of normal Office operations.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple FileCreate events for SDXHelper.exe might be worth investigating further to confirm if they're legitimate. But without additional context, like if there are other processes involved or if the files are being accessed in an unusual way, it's hard to say. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a lot of activity, it seems to be within the bounds of normal Office operations. However, the sheer number of files created by SDXHelper.exe might warrant a closer look to ensure they're not part of a malicious payload disguised as legitimate files. But based on the information given, it's not clearly malicious. Therefore, it's somewhat interesting but not definitively suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries depict a mix of **normal Office-related activity** and **potentially suspicious patterns**, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Legitimate Activity**\n- **`EXCEL.EXE` loading system DLLs**:  \n  The loading of `mscoree.dll`, `amsi.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, etc., is standard for Excel, as these DLLs support .NET runtime, anti-malware scanning, and URL handling. No anomalies here.\n\n- **`SDXHelper.exe` creating localized UI string files**:  \n  Files like `am-et-ui-strings-json_*.js` in the `Office SolutionPackages` directory are consistent with **Office localization resources**. These files are typically generated during package installation or updates.\n\n- **Registry modifications by `svchost.exe` and `HxTsr.exe`**:  \n  These processes are associated with system services and Office operations, respectively. Registry changes here align with their expected roles.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Patterns**\n- **High volume of file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**:  \n  The process creates **multiple JavaScript files** with **hash-based filenames** in the `Office SolutionPackages` directory. While this could be part of a legitimate Office update, the **repetition and lack of clear context** (e.g., no corresponding installation logs) raises questions. Malware sometimes uses hash-based filenames to evade detection.\n\n- **File stream creation in temporary directory**:  \n  The event where `EXCEL.EXE` creates a file stream (`1680A406.xlsx`) in the `Temp` directory is **normal for temporary processing**, but the absence of additional metadata (e.g., file content hashes) limits definitive conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Questions for Further Investigation**\n- **Are the `SDXHelper.exe`-created files part of a known Office update or package?**  \n  Cross-referencing with Microsoft's documentation or system logs could clarify this.\n\n- **Is `SDXHelper.exe` behaving unusually?**  \n  Monitoring for unexpected network activity, unexpected parent processes, or deviations from typical behavior (e.g., creating files outside the `SolutionPackages` directory) would help.\n\n- **Are the hash-based filenames linked to legitimate Office resources?**  \n  Analyzing the files' contents (if accessible) could confirm their legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity is **not definitively malicious**, the **high volume of file creation** by `SDXHelper.exe` and the **hash-based filenames** warrant **closer scrutiny**. These patterns could indicate either a **legitimate Office update** or a **malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one**. Further analysis (e.g., file content inspection, process tree examination) is recommended to rule out threats. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** due to the unusual volume and naming conventions of the files created by `SDXHelper.exe`."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events where EXCEL.EXE is creating file streams, specifically for a file named 1680A406.xlsx with a Zone.Identifier. Zone.Identifier is usually related to Internet Explorer's security zones, and when a file is downloaded, Windows adds this stream to mark it as coming from the internet. But creating such a stream might be normal if the file was downloaded. However, the fact that it's happening multiple times could be a red flag. Wait, but looking at the paths, they're in the Temp directory under Packages, which might be part of Office's temporary storage. Maybe that's normal, but I should check more.\n\nThen, there are several File created events by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft Office, so creating files in the SolutionPackages directory under AppData might be normal. But there are duplicates, like the same file being created twice. However, that could just be a log duplication error or normal operations. The names of the files are things like az-latn-az-ui-strings-json, which look like localization files. Maybe part of an Office update or installation.\n\nAnother event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's setting up. But the .new extension suggests it's a temporary file being written, which could be part of a normal process. However, if this is unexpected, it might be worth looking into.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events by EXCEL.EXE and Explorer.EXE. Registry changes can be suspicious if they're modifying security settings or adding new keys. However, Excel might modify the registry for its own settings, like recent files or preferences. But having so many registry events (multiple entries of EXCEL.EXE setting registry values) could indicate something like a macro or add-in that's making changes. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking for anomalies: The Zone.Identifier streams are normal, but maybe the repeated creation of the same files by SDXHelper? But looking at the paths, they are in different directories. For example, some are in Recent, which might be normal for Excel creating shortcuts. The Cronograma file is a .LNK in Recent, which is where Windows stores recent files. That seems normal.\n\nThe Explorer.EXE registry event is a bit concerning. If Explorer is setting registry values, maybe it's related to user settings, but again, without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there are multiple registry events from Excel might be normal if it's just updating its own settings.\n\nIs there anything that stands out as malicious? The Zone.Identifier is a red herring if it's just a downloaded file. The SDXHelper files are part of Office, so unless there's an unusual number of files being created or unexpected paths, it's normal. The winlogbeat file is part of log shipping, so that's likely benign. The registry events are common for applications.\n\nWait, but there's a possible issue with the EXCEL.EXE creating multiple registry entries. If Excel is modifying registry keys that are not related to its normal operations, that could be a problem. However, without specific details on the keys or values, it's hard to say. The logs don't show the actual registry keys or values, just that a value was set. So maybe that's not enough to flag it as suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be looking for signs of malware, like unusual processes, unexpected file creation, or registry changes. However, all the processes here (EXCEL.EXE, SDXHelper.exe, Explorer.EXE, winlogbeat.exe) are legitimate. The files created are in standard locations for their respective applications. The duplication of some events might be a logging issue rather than an actual problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are multiple events, they all seem to be related to normal operations of Office and other legitimate processes. There's no clear indication of malicious activity here. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's additional context or more suspicious activities not captured here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate any clear signs of malicious activity or security threats. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Normal Application Behavior:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE** creating `.LNK` files in `AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent` is standard for tracking recent files.\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** generating localization files (e.g., `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json`) in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` aligns with Office's use of temporary and language-specific resources.\n   - **winlogbeat.exe** creating a `.yml.new` configuration file in `Downloads` is consistent with log-shipping tools writing temporary files during setup.\n\n2. **Zone.Identifier Streams:**\n   - The repeated creation of `1680A406.xlsx` with a `Zone.Identifier` stream in the Temp directory is typical for marking files as originating from the internet. This is a standard Windows behavior for downloaded files and not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **Registry Events:**\n   - Multiple **Registry value set** events by **EXCEL.EXE** and **Explorer.EXE** are common for applications updating user preferences, recent files, or configuration settings. Without specific details on the keys\/values modified, these cannot be flagged as anomalous.\n\n4. **Duplicates and Logging Artifacts:**\n   - Duplicate entries (e.g., same file created by SDXHelper.exe twice) may reflect logging inconsistencies rather than actual malicious activity.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events described are consistent with legitimate user activity and standard operations of Microsoft Office and associated tools. There is no evidence of malware, unauthorized access, or suspicious behavior requiring further investigation. **This batch is not interesting for security purposes.**\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \n**Not Interesting** – All observed activities align with normal application behavior."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through the entries.\n\nMost of the events are about EXCEL.EXE performing registry value sets. There are like 12 of those. Then there are a few entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific directories under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. The files have names that look like random strings followed by .js extensions. \n\nHmm, so why is this potentially interesting? Well, Excel is a common application, and modifying the registry could be part of normal operations, but doing it repeatedly might be a red flag. However, the main thing here is the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for add-ins or solutions. But creating a bunch of files with those names... Maybe it's part of a legitimate Office add-in installation. However, the filenames have hashes or unique identifiers, which could be normal for packaging resources. \n\nBut then again, the fact that there are multiple files created in different package directories might indicate some kind of deployment or update. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes by Excel might be part of a larger process. \n\nBut are there any signs of malicious activity? The events don't mention any unusual network activity beyond the DNS query from Excel, which is normal. The files created are JavaScript files, which are common for Office add-ins. However, if these files are being written to unexpected locations or have unusual content, that could be a problem. But the logs don't provide details about the file content, just the paths. \n\nWait, the paths are under SolutionPackages, which is a known directory for Office solutions. The filenames include hashes, which might be part of the package's unique identifiers. So maybe this is a legitimate installation or update of an Office add-in. \n\nBut the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. The key here is that while some of these activities are normal, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and the creation of several files by SDXHelper.exe could be part of a larger process. However, without more context, like the source of the add-in, or any anomalies in the files, it's hard to say definitively. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the SDXHelper.exe is being used maliciously here. But SDXHelper is a legitimate tool. Still, the number of files created might be higher than usual. But again, without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's some activity that could be normal, the repetition and the specific directories might warrant further investigation to ensure that it's not part of a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate Office operation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **EXCEL.EXE Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple entries of `EXCEL.EXE` performing `Registry Value Set` operations are typical for legitimate Excel operations (e.g., updating settings, add-ins, or macros). However, **repeated or excessive registry changes** could indicate tampering or malware.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation**  \n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft Office component used for managing add-ins and solutions. The creation of `.js` files in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` is consistent with **Office add-in deployments** or updates. The filenames (e.g., `taskpane_e0bdd6190d96fa9514e08006ef2230b9.js`) include hashes, which are common in packaged resources.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **High Volume of File Creations**  \n   - Multiple `SDXHelper.exe` entries creating files across different `SolutionPackages` directories (e.g., `36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b`, `f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b`) could indicate **unusual deployment activity**. While normal for add-ins, this might also suggest **malicious packaging** (e.g., obfuscated scripts or hidden payloads).\n\n2. **Absence of Contextual Details**  \n   - The logs lack information about:\n     - **File content** (e.g., whether the `.js` files contain malicious code).\n     - **User interaction** (e.g., was this triggered by a user action or automated process?).\n     - **Source of the add-in** (e.g., trusted vs. untrusted publisher).\n\n3. **Combination with Excel Activity**  \n   - The co-occurrence of `EXCEL.EXE` registry changes and `SDXHelper.exe` file creation might hint at **cross-process manipulation**, though this could also be part of a legitimate workflow (e.g., an add-in modifying Excel settings).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Analyze File Content**  \n   - Check the contents of the created `.js` files to ensure they are legitimate Office add-in scripts and not malicious payloads (e.g., obfuscated code, network requests to suspicious domains).\n\n2. **Verify Add-In Sources**  \n   - Confirm that the add-ins are from trusted publishers and were installed intentionally by the user.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**  \n   - Look for additional suspicious activity, such as:\n     - Unusual network traffic from `SDXHelper.exe` or `EXCEL.EXE`.\n     - Unexpected modifications to other system files or registry keys.\n\n4. **Check for Known Malware Signatures**  \n   - Use antivirus tools or threat intelligence platforms to scan the files and processes for known malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is consistent with legitimate Office operations, the **high volume of file creations** and **lack of contextual details** merit further investigation. This could be a **benign deployment** or a **malicious attempt** to inject malicious scripts via Office add-ins. A deeper dive into file content, add-in sources, and network behavior is necessary to confirm."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a list of log entries, and they want to know if there's any suspicious activity here. The task is to determine if these logs indicate a potential security threat or just normal operations.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the processes involved. Most of the entries are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. The filenames seem to be language-specific UI string files, like \"da-dk-ui-strings-json_...\" and others. That makes me think these might be part of a legitimate Office update or localization package. However, I should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is associated with some software, maybe related to Microsoft products, but I'm not entirely sure. It might be a good idea to verify if this is a legitimate process or if it's been used by malware.\n\nThen there's one entry from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for shipping logs to Elasticsearch, so that's probably normal. The user might be setting up or configuring Winlogbeat, which is common in monitoring setups.\n\nLooking at the file paths, the SDXHelper entries are all in the SolutionPackages folder under AppData. That seems like a standard location for some applications to store temporary or update files. However, the fact that there are so many files being created, each with different language codes, might be a red flag. If this is part of a legitimate update, there might be a specific reason for multiple language files, but it's also possible that malware is using this directory to drop files.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the repetition of the same process creating multiple files. If SDXHelper is a legitimate process, it's possible that it's just handling a large update. However, if the process is malicious, it could be distributing payloads across different files. The presence of a .new file in the Downloads directory might indicate a configuration change, which is normal for Winlogbeat but could also be part of an attack if the file is being modified by an unauthorized process.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators of compromise. For example, are there any unusual parameters in the file names? The hash values in the filenames (like \"da-dk-ui-strings-json_...\") might be random, but they could also be part of a naming convention. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be running a monitoring tool, and these logs are part of normal operations. However, if the user is not expecting these logs, it could be an indicator of something malicious. Since the user hasn't provided any additional context, I have to rely solely on the logs.\n\nIn summary, while some entries are from legitimate processes, the high number of files created by SDXHelper in a non-standard directory could be suspicious. It's possible that this is a legitimate update, but without more information, it's safer to consider it as a potential threat. The presence of Winlogbeat is normal, but the SDXHelper activity needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **Winlogbeat.exe**:\n   - The entry involving `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory is **normal**. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, and configuration files (e.g., `.yml`) are commonly edited or created during setup.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe (Potential Legitimacy)**:\n   - The majority of entries involve `SDXHelper.exe` creating language-specific UI string files (e.g., `da-dk-ui-strings-json_...`) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. These files might be part of **legitimate Office updates** or localization packages, as Microsoft and third-party software often use such directories for temporary or localized resources.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **High Volume of Files**:\n   - The creation of **numerous files** (over 20 entries) by `SDXHelper.exe` in a short timeframe raises concerns. Legitimate processes typically do not generate this volume of files in a single directory, especially with language-specific naming patterns.\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - While the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory is a known location for some applications, the `SolutionPackages` subdirectory is **less common** for standard software. This could indicate a **non-standard or obfuscated process**.\n\n3. **Lack of Context**:\n   - No additional context (e.g., user activity, system state, or known benign behavior of `SDXHelper.exe`) is provided. This makes it difficult to confirm legitimacy without further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** and **file hash** of `SDXHelper.exe` to confirm it is a legitimate process. Use tools like [VirusTotal](https:\/\/www.virustotal.com\/) for analysis.\n   - Search for `SDXHelper.exe` in system logs or task manager to see if it is associated with known software.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Investigate the **source** of the files (e.g., network traffic, user actions) to determine if they were downloaded or generated locally.\n   - Check for **unauthorized modifications** to the `SolutionPackages` directory.\n\n3. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/malware tools to detect potential threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., Winlogbeat) is legitimate, the **high volume of files created by `SDXHelper.exe`** in a non-standard directory warrants further investigation. This could indicate either:\n- A **legitimate but unusual update process**, or  \n- **Malicious activity** (e.g., file dropper or persistence mechanism).\n\n**Action Required**: Verify the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` and monitor for additional suspicious behavior."}

The filenames are things like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json_e7dfbea71abb6781ead8c8671a96a5eb.js\" and similar. Those look like localization files for UI strings. But why are they being created by SDXHelper.exe? SDXHelper might be part of an Office add-in or a tool used for deploying solutions. However, creating multiple files in that directory could indicate an installation or update process. But is that normal?\n\nWait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is to see if there's any malicious behavior. The logs don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or commands that are typically associated with attacks. The processes involved are EXCEL.EXE and SDXHelper.exe, which are legitimate if they're part of a valid Office add-in or solution. However, the repetition of registry changes by Excel might be a bit unusual. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or any other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nOn the other hand, if SDXHelper.exe is creating these files as part of a legitimate Office solution, then this might be normal. But if the files are from unknown sources or the process isn't supposed to be running, that's a problem. Since the logs don't mention any errors or other processes, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering that there are 20 entries, most of which are registry changes by Excel, and a few file creations by SDXHelper. If this is part of a normal user activity, like installing an add-in, then it's not interesting. But if the user hasn't initiated such an action, it might be. However, without knowing the context of the user's actions, the logs alone might not be enough to classify as interesting. The confidence here is moderate. Maybe 0.6. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the registry changes are all in a specific key that's known to be exploited, that would be a red flag. But since the task is just \"Registry value set,\" without specifics, it's hard to tell. So maybe the answer is that it's not clearly malicious but warrants further investigation. Hence, the classification would be \"interesting\" with a moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries primarily involve **EXCEL.EXE** performing repeated **registry value set** operations and **SDXHelper.exe** creating files in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **EXCEL.EXE Registry Activity**:\n   - The repetition of registry modifications by Excel is unusual. While Excel may interact with the registry during add-in installations or macro executions, such frequent activity could indicate **unauthorized configuration changes** or **malicious tampering** (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation**:\n   - The files created (e.g., `transcription-strings.min.js`, `taskpane.js`) are localized UI strings or JavaScript files, which are **common in Office add-ins**. However, the lack of context (e.g., user-initiated installation) raises questions. If these files are from **unknown sources**, this could indicate a **suspicious deployment**.\n\n3. **Lack of Explicit Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No clear signs of malware (e.g., unusual processes, network activity, or errors) are present in the logs. The processes (`EXCEL.EXE`, `SDXHelper.exe`) are legitimate if part of a **valid Office solution**.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Low to Moderate Risk**: The activity is not definitively malicious but warrants further investigation. The repeated registry changes by Excel and the file creation by SDXHelper could be part of a **legitimate add-in deployment** or **unauthorized tampering**.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- **Contextual Analysis**: Verify if the user intentionally installed an Office add-in or solution. Check the **registry keys modified** by Excel and the **origin of SDXHelper.exe** (e.g., digital signature, file path).\n- **Monitor for Anomalies**: If the user has no knowledge of such actions, investigate for **unauthorized software** or **compromised accounts**.\n\n### Final Classification:\n- **Interesting for Investigation**: The logs are not clearly malicious but exhibit patterns that could indicate **legitimate activity** or **potential compromise**. Further context is required to determine the risk level.\n\n**Confidence Level**: Moderate (60%)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are five entries here, all related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe. The files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory under the user's AppData. The filenames look like they're language-specific UI strings, like mk-mk, ml-in, mr-in, and nb-no. \n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I know that Office might have some helper executables, but I'm not sure if SDXHelper is one of them. Maybe it's part of some add-in or third-party software?\n\nThe files are all JavaScript files named with language codes and hashes. The repetition of some filenames, like the mr-in one appearing twice, might be a red flag. Also, the paths are all within the Office SolutionPackages folder, which is typically used for add-ins or solutions. But why would these files be created there? Maybe the process is legitimately installing or updating something, but the fact that multiple files are created in quick succession could indicate malicious activity.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to be malicious. From what I remember, some malware uses similar naming conventions for obfuscation. The use of hashes in the filenames might be to make them unique and harder to detect. Also, the fact that all these files are created by the same process might be suspicious. Legitimate software usually doesn't create multiple files in that directory without user interaction.\n\nAnother point: the Office folder is a common target for attackers because of the potential for macro-based attacks or exploitation of vulnerabilities. If this is part of a larger attack chain, these files could be part of a dropper or configuration files for malware.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence here like failed security checks, network connections, or registry changes. The events only show file creation. So, while suspicious, it's not conclusive. But the combination of the process name, the location, and the nature of the files makes this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with language-specific UI string names (e.g., mk-mk, ml-in, nb-no) are created in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory by SDXHelper.exe, a non-standard process. The repetitive filenames and unusual path suggest potential malicious activity, such as obfuscation or unauthorized add-in deployment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
