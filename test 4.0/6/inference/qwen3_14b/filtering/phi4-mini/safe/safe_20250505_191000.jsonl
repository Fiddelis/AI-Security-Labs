{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is rundll32.exe executing a command with a GUID, which might be suspicious. Then there's svchost.exe with registry changes, which isn't always bad but could be part of something. Then EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs like combase.dll, mscoree.dll, urlmon.dll, and amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But then EXCEL.EXE is creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder, which could be a shortcut to something malicious. Also, there are multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. Excel usually doesn't do DNS queries on its own. This might indicate that someone is using Excel to execute malicious code or that there's a macro involved. The winlogbeat event is just a file creation, which is normal. But the combination of EXCEL loading unexpected DLLs, creating a shortcut, and making DNS queries seems suspicious. Maybe someone is trying to bypass security measures or download something. The confidence isn't 100% because some events are normal, but the combination of these actions makes it interesting enough to investigate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: rundll32 executing a GUID-based command, EXCEL.EXE loading multiple system DLLs (amsi.dll, urlmon.dll), creating a .LNK file in the Recent directory, and performing repeated DNS queries from EXCEL, which is unusual behavior for a standard application.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
