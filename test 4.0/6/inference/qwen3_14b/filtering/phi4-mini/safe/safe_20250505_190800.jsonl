First, I notice that there are multiple events related to PowerShell.exe. The initial events show PowerShell creating processes and loading various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell's operation. However, there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the file paths, some of the DLLs being loaded are from the .NET Framework, which is standard. But then there's an event where a file named \"teste.ps1\" is created in the Downloads folder. That's a script file, which could be benign, but the next event shows that PowerShell is executed with the -ExecutionPolicy Bypass parameter and runs this script. Bypassing the execution policy is a red flag because it allows scripts to run without restrictions, which is often used in attacks.\n\nThen, there's a file created in the Temp directory named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1\" and later deleted. This could be part of a script testing or policy check, but the fact that it's created and then deleted might be suspicious. Also, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might indicate some unusual activity related to PowerShell providers.\n\nAdditionally, there's a registry value set event from PowerShell, which could be modifying settings. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs might be normal, but combined with the script execution and bypassing execution policies, it raises concerns.\n\nI should also check if there are any other unusual processes. The first event mentions mmc.exe, which is a legitimate Microsoft Management Console, but it's not directly related to the PowerShell activities. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file for a logbeat configuration, which might be part of a monitoring tool, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious points are the use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, the creation and deletion of temporary script files, and the execution of a script from the Downloads folder. These are common in attack scenarios where an attacker tries to run malicious scripts without detection. However, without more evidence like network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the combination of these events, it's leaning towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show script execution with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET DLLs, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are three log entries, all related to PowerShell.exe. The first event is a file creation in the Temp directory with a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script. Then, the second event is a file delete logged for the same file. The third event is another file creation, but this time in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory.\n\nHmm, creating and then deleting a script in the Temp folder might be a red flag. Temp directories are often used for temporary files, but creating a script there and then deleting it could be an attempt to execute something without leaving traces. However, the deletion might be part of normal operations, like a script that's supposed to run and then clean up. But the fact that it's a .ps1 file, which is executable, could be suspicious.\n\nThe third event is another file creation, but in a different location. StartupProfileData-NonInteractive is related to PowerShell profiles. If a script is being created there, it might be trying to modify the startup profile, which could be a way to persist access or execute commands automatically. That's definitely a concerning activity because it could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence on the system.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating a script in Temp, deleting it, and then creating another in the StartupProfileData might suggest an attack chain. The attacker could be testing the environment (like the first script), then trying to establish persistence through the startup profile. Even though the first file was deleted, the fact that there's an attempt to create a file in a location related to PowerShell profiles is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The confidence here is medium because while these actions are suspicious, they could potentially be part of legitimate operations, but the combination makes it more likely to be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"PowerShell.exe creates and deletes a script file in Temp directory, then creates another in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, suggesting potential malicious activity like script execution and persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
