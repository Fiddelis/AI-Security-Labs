So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a normal command to get user info. But then there's another powershell.exe with a command line that's creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" and pointing to an executable in a non-standard path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That path doesn't look like a typical Windows directory. Usually, system files are in System32 or Program Files, but this is in a folder named \"unidade_logico\" which might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some .NET frameworks and Windows Defender DLLs. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads could indicate the execution of a malicious script that's loading additional components. However, the key point here is the creation of the new service. Creating a service with a custom executable is a common technique used by malware to persist on a system. The fact that the service is being started immediately after creation also raises suspicion.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The file name is a PowerShell script, which might be part of the attack chain. The use of PowerShell for creating and managing services, combined with the unusual file paths and the deletion of the script, suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nThe services.exe process has several Registry value set events. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's modifying the registry, that could be part of a legitimate system update or a malicious attempt to change system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But combined with the other PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable, the use of PowerShell for that task, the loading of multiple DLLs, and the temporary file creation and deletion all point towards a possible security incident. The confidence here is high because these are common indicators of compromise, especially the service creation and the PowerShell script execution. However, I should note that without more data, there's a small chance this could be a false positive, but the combination of events makes it likely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands, including creating a new service with a non-standard executable path (C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe) and loading unusual DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first thing I notice is that there's a process called 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading several DLLs related to the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. That seems normal because those are standard .NET components. But wait, 'tarefa_logico.exe' isn't a typical Windows process. The name doesn't ring a bell as a standard executable. Maybe it's a typo or a misnamed process?\n\nThen there are multiple entries for 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' with registry value set events. Those are common system processes, so their activity might be normal. However, the repetition of 'Registry value set' events for 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' could indicate something. But since they're legitimate processes, maybe it's just routine system updates or configuration changes.\n\nThe 'powershell.exe' entries include a file created in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for PowerShell profiles, so creating a startup profile file might be normal. However, the second PowerShell event is a registry value set, which could be part of a script or configuration change. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nNow, looking at the 'tarefa_logico.exe' again. It's loading .NET DLLs, which is normal for .NET applications. But if this process is not supposed to be running, or if it's loading unexpected DLLs, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or command-line arguments that suggest exploitation.\n\nThe other entries are mostly system processes doing standard tasks. The 'MsMpEng.exe' is Windows Defender, so its registry changes might be part of its operation. The 'svchost.exe' entries are also normal as they host various system services.\n\nPutting it all together, there's nothing here that clearly indicates a security threat. The 'tarefa_logico.exe' might be a legitimate application, or it could be a suspicious process that's not well-known. However, based solely on the provided logs, there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The events are either normal system activities or require more context to determine if they're harmful.

The first thing I notice is that there are a bunch of entries where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry. However, seeing multiple instances of the same process performing the same action might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's anything else going on.\n\nThen, there are several entries involving setup.exe creating files. The files are all related to Microsoft Edge components, like msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others. The paths are in the Program Files directory, which is typical for software installations. However, setup.exe is usually associated with installation processes. But wait, the last entry shows setup.exe creating another setup.exe in the Installer directory. That seems a bit odd. Typically, setup.exe would be the installer, but creating another setup.exe within its own installation directory might be a sign of something unusual, like a dropper or a malicious payload.\n\nAlso, there's an entry where setup.exe loads taskschd.dll from the System32 directory. Taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, so that's a legitimate file. But if setup.exe is loading it, maybe there's an attempt to interact with the Task Scheduler for malicious purposes, like creating scheduled tasks.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple registry changes by svchost.exe (which could be normal or part of a larger attack), and setup.exe creating a bunch of files, including another setup.exe. The presence of multiple files being created by setup.exe might indicate a legitimate installation, but the repetition and the fact that setup.exe is creating another setup.exe could be suspicious. However, since the files are associated with Microsoft Edge, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate update or installation process. But why are there so many entries? Maybe the setup process is being repeated, or there's an error in the logging.\n\nOn the other hand, if this were a malicious activity, the setup.exe might be part of a malware installation, creating its own files and modifying the registry. However, without more context, like unusual registry keys being modified or the presence of other suspicious processes, it's hard to say for sure. The fact that the files are in standard locations and associated with a known product (Microsoft Edge) makes me lean towards it being legitimate. However, the repetition of events and the creation of another setup.exe might still warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, the classification here is a bit tricky. The events could be part of a normal installation, but the volume and specific actions might indicate something more. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity beyond the unusual file creation and registry changes, but the presence of those events is not definitively malicious, I'd say it's interesting enough to warrant a closer look.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to the Registry being modified. Processes like svchost.exe and services.exe are making changes to the registry, which is normal to some extent, but when it's frequent, it might be a red flag. However, there's also setup.exe involved here. \n\nLooking further down, there are file creation events under the FileCreate rule. Specifically, setup.exe is creating files like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe in the Program Files directory, and also creating shortcut files in the Start Menu and Quick Launch areas. \n\nWait, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. If this is part of a legitimate software installation, like Microsoft Edge, then creating these files might be normal. But the presence of multiple registry changes along with file creations could indicate an installation or update. However, I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThe file paths mentioned are in standard locations for applications. For example, Program Files (x86) for 32-bit apps and the Start Menu for shortcuts. The filenames like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe are known components of Microsoft Edge. The shortcuts created are also typical for applications. \n\nBut why so many registry events? If setup.exe is part of a legitimate installer, modifying the registry to set up the application is expected. However, the repetition of the same tasks (Registry value set) might be part of the installation process. However, if there's no other suspicious activity, like unusual processes, network connections, or unexpected file modifications, this might just be a standard installation.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The key here is that all these events are related to a legitimate software installation (Microsoft Edge). However, without more context, like whether this is a known installation or if there are other anomalies, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut the presence of setup.exe creating files and modifying the registry could be part of a legitimate process. However, the high number of events might be normal for an installation. But since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, maybe it's not necessarily malicious. However, sometimes attackers use setup.exe or similar names for malicious purposes. \n\nBut given the file paths and the names of the files created, they seem legitimate. Also, svchost.exe and services.exe are common system processes. So, unless there's something else, like the files being created in unusual locations or with different hashes, this might not be suspicious. \n\nBut the justification needs to be concise. The main point is that the events are related to a software installation, which is a normal activity. However, since the user is looking for potential malicious behavior, maybe the high number of registry changes and file creations could be a sign. But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, the classification options are INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. If the events are part of a legitimate installation, then it's NOT INTERESTING. However, if there's a possibility that it's not legitimate, maybe INTERESTING. But the user's system might be undergoing a legitimate installation, so the events are normal. \n\nAlternatively, if the setup.exe is not part of a known installation, that could be suspicious. But the files created are linked to Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate application. Therefore, the batch is likely part of a normal installation process. Hence, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING. However, the confidence might be medium because without knowing the context of the setup.exe, it's possible that it's part of a legitimate process but could also be a mimicry of a legitimate installation. But since the files and processes are legitimate, the confidence is higher. \n\nSo, the justification would be that the events are related to a software installation (Microsoft Edge) and standard system processes, which is normal activity. Therefore, not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to a software installation (Microsoft Edge) and standard system processes, which is normal activity.

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from 'setup.exe' with registry-related activities. There are multiple entries where the task is 'Registry value set' and one instance of 'Registry object added or deleted'. Then there are some 'Pipe Created' events also from setup.exe. Then, there's a RuntimeBroker.exe doing a registry value set, which might be normal, but not sure yet.\n\nBut wait, the more concerning part is the svchost.exe entries. There are several files created in the Windows Temp directory with paths like APPX.eupxogogonk2uz72tg0nuo3qd.tmp and others. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but when it's creating a lot of temporary files in the Temp directory, that could be suspicious. Especially since these files have random names, which might be an indicator of malicious activity, like dropping payloads or temporary files from an installation or exploitation process.\n\nAlso, the fact that setup.exe is making multiple registry changes and creating pipes could be part of a setup or installation, but combined with the svchost.exe creating numerous files in Temp, it might indicate something more. However, I should check if these are normal operations. For example, during software installation, setup.exe might modify the registry, and svchost.exe might create temp files. But the high volume here might be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is that the files are in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but the sheer number and the fact that they're all named with APPX might be part of a Windows Update or AppX package, which is normal. However, if these are not related to a known update or installation, that could be suspicious.\n\nBut the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The presence of multiple registry changes by setup.exe and the numerous temp files created by svchost.exe could be indicative of a potential malicious activity, such as a dropper or a setup that's part of a malware installation. However, without more context, like the source of setup.exe or the nature of the files, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of these events might be worth looking into further.\n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a high number of registry modifications and temp file creations, which could be signs of malicious behavior.

The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple file creation events by svchost.exe. The files are in the WindowsApps directory for EdgeGameAssist.exe and some AppReadiness folders with SIDs. Now, svchost.exe is a normal system process that hosts various system services, but creating files in AppReadiness might be suspicious. However, I remember that AppReadiness is involved in application compatibility, so maybe those files are part of legitimate operations. But creating multiple files with SIDs in that directory could be a red flag. Also, EdgeGameAssist.exe is a legitimate Microsoft app, but if it's being created in an unusual location or under unusual circumstances, that might be a problem.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if there are a lot of them, especially from svchost, that might indicate something's wrong. However, svchost can host services that modify the registry, so it's not necessarily malicious, but it's worth checking.\n\nThen there's a RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is usually associated with UAC prompts and app permissions, so that might be normal. But again, multiple events could be a sign of something.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Write-Host 'Final result: 1'. That seems benign, just a test command. But then there are multiple image load events for powershell.exe loading various .dll files. The paths like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and System.Management.Automation.ni.dll are all legitimate .NET and PowerShell components. However, if these are being loaded from unexpected locations or if there are unusual parameters, that could be a problem. But in this case, the paths look standard.\n\nPutting this all together: the main suspicious points are the multiple file creations in AppReadiness by svchost.exe. The repetition of the same file paths might indicate an attempt to create files that could be part of a malicious payload. However, since the files are in system directories and svchost is a legitimate process, it's not conclusive. The registry changes and PowerShell activities don't seem obviously malicious here.

That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the specific events. \n\nThere are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to files in the Windows Defender directory, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate Defender components, so maybe that's normal. But then there are other events like 'File created' in the Windows Temp directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_... These could be temporary files, but sometimes attackers use temp folders to execute malicious scripts. \n\nAnother event shows a PowerShell command that's checking INF files for certain patterns. The command line is a bit complex, but it's looking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. Not sure if that's malicious yet. It might be part of a script that's checking for specific configurations, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a 'Process accessed' event, which might indicate something trying to interact with another process. However, multiple processes accessing each other isn't necessarily bad. \n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is a legitimate tool for checking user context, so that's probably normal. \n\nNow, looking at the frequency of PowerShell events. There are multiple ImageLoad events for .dll files related to .NET and Windows Defender. Some of these are standard, but the repetition might be a red flag. Also, the creation of multiple files in Temp could be part of a larger attack, like downloading payloads or executing scripts.\n\nBut wait, the justification needs to be concise.

That's a red flag because disabling security features is a common tactic for malware.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of Dism.exe detecting executable files in the Temp directory.

The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected (rule: FileExecutableDetected)\" each time. The files mentioned are all .mui files in the Temp directory under AppData. \n\nHmm, .mui files are usually language-specific resources for Windows, part of the operating system.

However, the fact that so many .mui files are being detected as executables might be suspicious. \n\nWait, but maybe this is part of a legitimate process. For example, when Dism is running, it might be using these resources. But the path is in the Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files. However, the presence of multiple .mui files being detected as executable by the same process might indicate that something is wrong. \n\nBut I should check if there are any known issues. Dism.exe can be used by malware to drop files, but the .mui files are typically not executable. The rule FileExecutableDetected is triggered when an executable is detected, which might not be normal for .mui files. \n\nAlso, the same UUID in the path suggests that these files are part of a single session or process.

The GUID in the path suggests a unique session, which could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with the high number of executable files detected, it's suspicious.\n\nAlso, looking at the DLL names, some of them like \"FfuProvider.dll\" or \"MsiProvider.dll\" might be legitimate, but the fact that they're all being detected by Dism.exe in the Temp folder is unusual. Legitimate Dism operations usually don't involve so many DLLs in the Temp directory.

It is **not** designed to interact with temporary files in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory.\n\n2. **File Locations:**\n   - All files are located in a temporary directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{GUID}\\...`  \n     - The use of a **GUID** in the path suggests a **session-specific or temporary operation**, which is common in malware to avoid detection.\n     - The `Temp` directory is a **common location for malicious payloads** to execute or stage files.\n\n3. **File Types:**\n   - Multiple **DLL files** (e.g., `SmiProvider.dll`, `MsiProvider.dll`, `LogProvider.dll`) are flagged as **executable** by `Dism.exe`. \n   - While some DLLs (e.g., `MsiProvider.dll`) may have legitimate roles in Windows, the **volume and context** of these detections are unusual.\n\n4. **Repetition and Scope:**\n   - **16 events** are logged, all involving the same process (`Dism.exe`) and the same GUID-based directory. This repetition suggests a **coordinated action**, such as a **malware dropper** or **exploit chain**.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Suspicious File Paths:**  \n  `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{GUID}\\...`  \n  - Malware often uses temporary directories to store payloads or execute code.\n- **Unusual Use of `Dism.exe`:**  \n  - `Dism.exe` is not typically associated with loading arbitrary DLLs from the `Temp` directory. This could indicate **DLL hijacking** or **code injection**.\n- **High Volume of Executable Files:**  \n  - The detection of **16 executable DLLs** in a single session is highly atypical for legitimate system operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat:**\n- **Malware Execution via Dism:**  \n  - An attacker could have **exploited a vulnerability** in `Dism.exe` or **manipulated its behavior** to load malicious DLLs from the `Temp` directory.\n- **Persistence or Lateral Movement:**  \n  - The use of `Temp` directories and GUID-based paths is often seen in **malware persistence mechanisms** or **data exfiltration**.\n- **Bypassing Security Controls:**  \n  - The activity could be an attempt to **bypass endpoint detection** by leveraging legitimate tools (e.g., `Dism.exe`) in unexpected ways.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Isolate the Affected System:**  \n   - If this is a real-world scenario, isolate the system to prevent further compromise.\n2. **Analyze the Files:**  \n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal**, **PE analyzers**, or **sandboxing** to inspect the flagged DLLs for malicious content.\n3. **Check for Exploits or Vulnerabilities:**  \n   - Investigate if `Dism.exe` was exploited (e.g., via CVEs related to Windows Imaging).\n4. **Review System Logs:**  \n   - Look for additional logs (e.g., **Windows Event Viewer**, **SIEM alerts**) that might indicate the source of the files or the attacker's actions.\n5. **Update and Patch:**  \n   - Ensure the system is up to date with **Windows Security Updates** to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and likely represents a **malicious attempt to execute code via `Dism.exe`**. Immediate investigation is required to determine if the system has been compromised and to prevent further damage."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are all about processes related to Dism.exe and DismHost.exe, with various DLL files being loaded.\n\nFirst, I remember that Dism.exe is part of Windows Deployment Services, used for imaging and configuration. It's a legitimate tool, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. The logs show multiple files being detected as executables in the Temp directory. The Temp folder is a common place for malicious files because it's temporary and often overlooked. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all have the same UUID in the path: 33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89. That's a red flag. Malware often uses unique identifiers to avoid detection. Also, the files are named things like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc. These names sound like they could be part of a legitimate setup, but the fact that they're all in the Temp folder and loaded by DismHost.exe might be suspicious.\n\nThen there's the DismHost.exe process. The command line includes a GUID, which might be part of a legitimate operation, but again, the presence of multiple loaded DLLs from the same Temp directory could indicate something's wrong. Legitimate processes usually don't load so many DLLs from temporary locations. \n\nI should check if these files are known to be part of Windows. For example, DismCorePS.dll and DismProv.dll might be legitimate, but the others like SysprepProvider.dll or VhdProvider.dll could be part of a legitimate Windows image setup. However, the fact that they're all being loaded from the Temp directory might be unusual. \n\nAlso, the logs show both FileCreate and ImageLoad events. The ImageLoad events are for DLLs that are being loaded into memory. If those DLLs are from the Temp directory, that's a point of concern. Malware often loads malicious code from temporary directories to avoid being detected by static analysis.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the number of events. There are multiple entries for different DLLs being loaded, which could be part of a normal process, but the combination with the Temp directory and the unique UUID might indicate a setup that's not standard. \n\nI should also think about the user's context. If this is on a system that's not undergoing imaging or deployment, then these activities might be suspicious. But if it's a deployment server, then it's more likely legitimate. However, since the user hasn't provided that context, I have to assume it's a general case.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these processes and files are legitimate, the combination of multiple DLLs from the Temp directory, the use of a unique GUID, and the lack of typical signs of a legitimate deployment (like being part of a known setup process) makes this suspicious. Therefore, it's worth investigating further to rule out potential malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries involve a series of activities related to **`Dism.exe`** and **`DismHost.exe`**, with multiple DLLs being loaded from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\`). While some components (e.g., `DismCorePS.dll`, `DismProv.dll`) are legitimate parts of Windows Deployment Services, **several red flags** warrant further investigation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Unusual File Location**:\n   - All files (e.g., `ProvProvider.dll`, `OSProvider.dll`, `MsiProvider.dll`) are loaded from the **`Temp`** directory, which is **not typical for legitimate Windows processes**. Legitimate system components are usually located in system directories like `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\n2. **Unique GUID in File Paths**:\n   - The UUID `33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89` is embedded in all file paths. This is **common in malware** to avoid detection and create unique, temporary storage locations.\n\n3. **High Volume of ImageLoads**:\n   - **11 DLLs** are loaded from the same directory. While `DismHost.exe` is a legitimate process, **loading multiple DLLs from a temporary directory** is highly unusual and could indicate **malware masquerading as a legitimate tool**.\n\n4. **Potential for Code Injection**:\n   - The presence of `ImageLoad` events for DLLs from the `Temp` directory suggests **runtime loading of untrusted code**, which is a **common tactic in malware** to evade static analysis.\n\n5. **Absence of Clear Legitimacy**:\n   - Files like `SysprepProvider.dll`, `VhdProvider.dll`, and `LogProvider.dll` are **not standard Windows components**. While `DismCorePS.dll` and `DismProv.dll` are legitimate, the **combination of these files in this context** raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**\n- **`Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe`** are often used in **Windows imaging and deployment**, but such operations typically occur on **dedicated deployment servers** or during **system recovery**. If this activity occurs on a **non-deployment system**, it could indicate **malware using legitimate tools for persistence or privilege escalation**.\n- The **`Temp` directory** is a common location for **malware to stage payloads** due to its transient nature and lack of strict access controls.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Source of the Files**:\n   - Check if the files in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\` are part of a **known legitimate deployment** or if they match **malware signatures**.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior**:\n   - Look for **unauthorized system changes**, **network connections to suspicious IPs**, or **elevation of privileges** during the time these logs were generated.\n\n3. **Check for Legitimacy of the Deployment Context**:\n   - If this is a **deployment server**, ensure the activity aligns with **expected imaging workflows**. If not, treat it as a **potential security incident**.\n\n4. **Use Static Analysis Tools**:\n   - Analyze the DLLs for **malicious code** (e.g., using VirusTotal, YARA rules, or sandboxing).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some components are legitimate, the **unusual file location, unique GUID, and high volume of DLL loads** from the `Temp` directory **strongly suggest a potential security threat**. Further investigation is **critical** to rule out malware or unauthorized activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system log event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about the DismHost.exe process loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The paths all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ followed by a UUID and then the DLL names. The UUID here is 33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89, which is the same across all the file paths. That seems a bit odd because typically, temporary files might have different UUIDs each time, but maybe in this case, it's part of a specific operation.\n\nThen, there's a process termination event for DismHost.exe. After that, Dism.exe is deleting several of the DLL files that were previously loaded. The files being deleted are AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, and CbsProvider.dll. The other DLLs like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc., aren't mentioned in the deletion events. \n\nNow, thinking about this: DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool, which is used for Windows image management. It's common for DISM to load various providers (DLLs) when performing tasks like applying updates or configuring images. However, the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from a temporary directory might be normal during an image deployment or customization process. But then, why are some of them being deleted afterward?\n\nWait, the deletion events are from Dism.exe, which is another component of the DISM tool. It's possible that after the DismHost.exe process has finished its work, Dism.exe is cleaning up the temporary files. But why would they delete some and not others? For example, the AppxProvider.dll and AssocProvider.dll are deleted, but others like IntlProvider.dll aren't mentioned in the deletion logs. That might be normal if those specific DLLs were no longer needed, but it's also possible that some of these files are part of a larger operation that's being rolled back or that an error occurred.\n\nAnother point to consider: the UUID in the file paths. If this is part of a standard DISM operation, the UUID might be generated for that specific session. However, if there are a large number of such UUIDs or if the same UUID is reused in suspicious contexts, it could indicate something else. But with the given data, it's just one UUID.\n\nAlso, the fact that the process terminates after loading all these DLLs and then the files are deleted might be part of a legitimate process. However, the presence of so many DLLs being loaded and then some being deleted might be a red flag if it's not part of a known operation. But DISM does use many providers, so this could be normal.\n\nWait, but looking at the deletion events, the files being deleted are from the same temporary directory as the loaded DLLs. So it's possible that after the DismHost.exe process is done, the Dism.exe process is cleaning up the temporary files. However, the fact that not all DLLs are deleted might be because some are needed for other parts of the process or because the deletion was partial. Alternatively, maybe some of the files were not properly deleted, which could be an issue.\n\nBut given that DISM is a legitimate tool, and these operations are part of its normal functioning, this might not be malicious. However, the high number of DLLs loaded and the subsequent deletions might be something that an attacker could mimic. But without more context, like other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nIn summary, the events seem to be part of a DISM operation where DismHost.exe loads several providers, and then Dism.exe deletes some of the temporary files. This could be normal, but the combination of many DLLs being loaded and some being deleted might warrant further investigation to ensure that this is indeed a legitimate process and not part of a malicious activity. However, based solely on the provided information, it's more likely a legitimate DISM operation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a sequence of events involving **DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool)**, a legitimate Windows utility used for managing Windows images. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **DismHost.exe Loading DLLs**:\n   - Multiple DLLs (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `AssocProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`, etc.) are loaded by **DismHost.exe** from a temporary directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\...`.\n   - The UUID (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) is consistent across all file paths, suggesting a **single DISM operation** (e.g., image customization, update application, or sysprep).\n\n2. **Cleanup by Dism.exe**:\n   - After the process terminates, **Dism.exe** deletes some of the loaded DLLs (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `AssocProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`), but not all. This is **normal** during DISM workflows, as certain providers may be retained for later steps or logging.\n\n3. **Legitimate Context**:\n   - **DISM** is a standard tool for Windows deployment and imaging. Loading multiple providers (DLLs) is expected during tasks like:\n     - Applying updates.\n     - Customizing images.\n     - Running `sysprep` or `offline setup`.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Suspicious?**\n- **No clear signs of malicious activity**:\n  - The UUID is unique to this session, which is typical for temporary files.\n  - The cleanup by `Dism.exe` aligns with legitimate DISM behavior.\n  - No anomalies like unexpected processes, network activity, or unexplained file modifications are mentioned.\n\n- **Potential Legitimate Scenarios**:\n  - A user or system administrator is running a **custom Windows image deployment**.\n  - A **sysprep** operation is in progress, which often involves loading and cleaning up providers.\n\n---\n\n### **When to Investigate Further**\nWhile this is likely **legitimate**, further scrutiny is warranted if:\n1. **Unusual Context**:\n   - The user (`fiddelis`) has no administrative privileges.\n   - The operation occurs on a non-Windows server or endpoint.\n   - The UUID appears in multiple unrelated sessions.\n\n2. **Correlation with Other Events**:\n   - If logs show **unauthorized access**, **data exfiltration**, or **malware execution** around the same time.\n   - If the deleted DLLs are **not standard DISM providers**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events are **consistent with a legitimate DISM operation**. However, ensure that:\n- The user executing the operation has **appropriate permissions**.\n- The activity aligns with **known system workflows** (e.g., imaging, deployment).\n- No **unusual lateral movement** or **suspicious file modifications** are observed in correlated logs.\n\n**No immediate action is required** unless additional context points to a potential compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The main activity here is file deletions and a file creation time change. The files being deleted are in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder, which is common for temporary files. \n\nNow, Dism.exe is known to be used in system updates and deployments, so deleting temporary files after an operation makes sense. However, the sheer number of deletions might be a bit unusual. But wait, looking at the paths, they all point to the same Temp folder with the same GUID. That suggests that these files were part of a single session or operation, which is typical for temporary files created during a process.\n\nThe only non-deletion event is the file creation time change for DismHost.exe. Changing the creation time could be part of a legitimate process, like modifying timestamps during deployment. However, it's something to note. \n\nBut why would this be interesting? Well, if these deletions were part of a normal operation, they wouldn't be suspicious. However, if Dism.exe is being used in an unexpected way, like deleting files that shouldn't be deleted, or if there's a pattern that deviates from normal behavior, that could be a red flag. But in this case, all the files are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files to be stored and later deleted. \n\nAnother point is that the user is 'fiddelis', which might be a legitimate user account. There's no indication of privilege escalation or unusual access here. The events don't show any signs of malware or unauthorized activity. The files being deleted are all DLLs and MUI files, which are part of the system's deployment tools. \n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem to be part of a normal system operation, possibly a deployment or update process. The high number of deletions might be due to the temporary files being cleaned up after the process completes. Unless there's additional context indicating otherwise, like other suspicious activities or unauthorized access, these logs don't point to a security threat. Therefore, while the volume of deletions is notable, the context suggests it's a legitimate activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file deletion and timestamp modification events executed by the **`Dism.exe`** process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging tasks. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Context:**\n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a trusted system utility, commonly used during Windows updates, deployments, or imaging operations. Its involvement here aligns with legitimate system maintenance activities.\n\n2. **File Activity:**\n   - **Deletion of Temporary Files:** All deleted files are located in the **`%TEMP%`** directory under a GUID-specific folder (`3B7A4E8C-...`). This is typical for temporary files generated during deployment or imaging tasks, which are often cleaned up post-operation.\n   - **File Timestamp Modification:** A single event modifies the creation time of **`DismHost.exe`**, which could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., timestamp normalization during deployment).\n\n3. **Lack of Suspicious Indicators:**\n   - **No Malware Signatures:** The files involved (DLLs, MUI files) are standard components of Windows deployment tools.\n   - **No Anomalous Behavior:** The activity is confined to the **`Temp`** directory, which is a common location for temporary files. No system-critical files or user data are mentioned.\n   - **User Context:** The user account (`fiddelis`) is not flagged as malicious, and there is no evidence of privilege escalation or unauthorized access.\n\n### **Potential Legitimate Scenario:**\nThe logs likely correspond to a **Windows deployment or update operation** (e.g., using `DISM` to apply an update or image). During such processes:\n- Temporary files (e.g., `DismCore.dll`, `DismProv.dll`, etc.) are created and subsequently deleted.\n- Timestamp adjustments (e.g., `DismHost.exe`) may occur as part of system configuration or metadata updates.\n\n### **Why This Might Be \"Interesting\":**\n- **High Volume of Deletions:** While not inherently suspicious, the large number of deletions could be unusual if unrelated to a known deployment task. However, the files are all in a temporary directory, which justifies cleanup.\n- **Potential for Misinterpretation:** If the system lacks context (e.g., recent deployment activity), these logs might be misinterpreted as suspicious. However, without additional anomalies (e.g., network activity, unauthorized access), they are likely benign.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events appear to be **legitimate system behavior** associated with a deployment or update process. The activity is consistent with the expected operation of **`Dism.exe`** and does not indicate a security threat. **No action** is required unless there is additional context suggesting otherwise (e.g., unexpected deployment activity, user account compromise).\n\n**Final Classification:**  \n**`INTERESTING BUT BENIGN`** – The logs warrant attention due to their volume and system-level activity, but they align with normal `DISM`-related operations."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process deleting files in the Temp directory under a specific folder with a unique GUID. The files being deleted are all .mui files, which are typically language-specific resource files used by Windows.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why Dism.exe is deleting these files. Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. It's common for Dism to perform operations like applying updates or capturing images, which might involve temporary files. However, the deletion of multiple .mui files in the Temp directory could be part of a normal cleanup process after an operation, especially if those files were used as part of a deployment or imaging task.\n\nBut wait, the fact that all these deletions are happening in the same temporary directory with a specific GUID suggests that they might be related to a single event or process. The presence of multiple .mui files could indicate that they're part of a larger set of resources that were unpacked temporarily. However, if this were a malicious activity, I might expect to see other processes or events that don't align with normal Dism operations, like unexpected network activity, creation of suspicious files, or elevation of privileges.\n\nLooking at the logs provided, there's no indication of other suspicious activities. All events are related to file deletions by Dism.exe, which is a legitimate process. The path is in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files to be stored and later deleted. The use of a GUID in the path is also typical for temporary directories to avoid conflicts.\n\nHowever, the high number of deletions (15 files) might be a bit unusual. But considering that Dism can handle multiple components during an image deployment, this could still be normal. The key here is whether these deletions are part of a legitimate process or if they're being used to remove evidence of malicious activity. Since there's no other data here, like process creation events, network connections, or other anomalies, it's hard to point to this as malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, these events are likely part of a normal Dism operation where temporary .mui files are being cleaned up after a deployment or imaging task. There's no clear evidence of malicious behavior here. However, if this were part of a larger set of events with other suspicious activities, that would change the assessment. Based solely on the provided information, it's probably benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the legitimate Windows tool **`Dism.exe`** deleting multiple `.mui` files (language-specific resource files) from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\{GUID}\\en-US\\`).

It often generates and deletes temporary files during operations like applying updates, capturing images, or configuring system settings.\n\n2. **Temporary Directory Context**:\n   - The files are located in a temporary directory with a unique GUID (`{GUID}`), which is typical for Windows during imaging or deployment tasks. Such directories are often cleaned up after operations complete.\n\n3. **`.mui` Files**:\n   - These files are standard Windows resource files for localization. Their deletion here likely corresponds to cleanup after a deployment or imaging process that temporarily unpacked language-specific resources.\n\n4. **No Malicious Indicators**:\n   - There is no evidence of unusual activity (e.g., unexpected process creation, network connections, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms). All events are confined to file deletions by a legitimate process.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **likely benign** and part of a normal **`Dism.exe`** operation (e.g., post-deployment cleanup). The deletion of `.mui` files in a temporary directory aligns with expected behavior during Windows image management tasks. No immediate security concerns are apparent based on the provided data.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- If this occurs in an unusual context (e.g., during non-deployment periods or alongside other suspicious events), further investigation is warranted.

All the events are about files being deleted by Dism.exe, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The files are in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder.

However, I should check if this is unusual. Typically, Dism.exe is involved in tasks like applying updates or managing images. If these files were part of a temporary installation or update, their deletion could be normal. But why so many files? Maybe a large update or a custom image deployment.\n\nWait, the folder path has a GUID, which is common for temporary files. The fact that all these files are being deleted by Dism.exe might indicate that they were part of a package that's being removed. But is there any indication of malicious activity? The process is Dism.exe, which is legitimate. However, if these files were not supposed to be there, or if the deletion is part of a larger pattern of suspicious behavior, that could be a red flag.\n\nBut looking just at these events, there's no direct evidence of malware. The deletion of temporary files by a legitimate process is normal. Unless there are other events, like unauthorized access or unexpected execution, but those aren't present here. So, while it's a lot of file deletions, they might be part of a standard system operation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this log data to figure out what's happening. The user probably wants to know if there's any malicious activity here. Let me start by looking through the entries.\n\nFirst, there are several process creation events. The first one is 'services.exe' with a registry value set. That's normal, I think. Then 'sppsvc.exe' loading an image from 'taskschd.dll'—that's part of the Windows Task Scheduler, so maybe legitimate. But then there's 'svchost.exe' with another registry event. Still seems okay.\n\nThen there's a bunch of entries with 'powershell.exe' commands. The command line shows 'New-Service' creating a service named 'objeto_ativo' with a binary path pointing to 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe'. Then it starts that service. Hmm, creating a new service through PowerShell might be suspicious, especially if the service is pointing to a non-standard path like 'unidade_logico' instead of something like 'Program Files' or 'Windows\\System32'. Also, the name 'objeto_ativo' doesn't ring a bell as a standard service name. The fact that it's being created and started via PowerShell could be a red flag, especially if it's not part of a known legitimate process.\n\nThe next entries repeat the same PowerShell command multiple times, which might indicate that the script is being run multiple times, possibly to ensure the service is created or to perform some actions. Then there's a command that writes 'Final result: 1' to the host. That might be a test or a signal that something was successful. But why would that be done through PowerShell with a restricted execution policy? That could be an attempt to bypass security measures, but the execution policy being restricted might actually prevent scripts from running, so maybe that's a misconfiguration or a way to test if the policy is enforced.\n\nLooking at the file paths, 'tarefa_logico.exe' is in a directory named 'unidade_logico' which translates to 'logical unit' in Portuguese. That might be a custom or non-standard directory, which is suspicious. Also, the fact that the service is named 'objeto_ativo' (which means 'active object' in Portuguese) might be a red herring, but the directory structure seems off.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times. That could be a sign of automation or a script that's trying to persist by creating a service. The use of 'New-Service' and 'Start-Service' in the same command is a way to both create and start the service immediately. If this is part of a legitimate setup, it should be documented, but without that context, it's more likely to be malicious.\n\nThe 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be related to the execution of the PowerShell script, but without more context on the 'Engine' part, it's hard to say. However, repeated lifecycle events could indicate that the script is being processed multiple times, possibly due to errors or intentional repetition.\n\nIn summary, the key suspicious points are:\n1. Creation of a new service with a non-standard path and name.\n2. Repeated execution of the same PowerShell command, possibly to ensure the service is created.\n3. The use of a non-standard directory structure and service name, which might be an indicator of malicious activity.\n4. The presence of 'Final result: 1' which could be a signal or a test output.\n\nI should recommend further investigation, checking the files in the 'unidade_logico' directory, analyzing the 'tarefa_logico.exe' for malicious behavior, and reviewing the system's event logs for other related activities. Also, checking the execution policy settings to see if they were changed to allow this script to run.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate suspicious activity that could be associated with malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Identified**\n1. **Unusual Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - A new service named **`objeto_ativo`** (translated as \"active object\") was created using the `New-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell.\n   - **Binary Path**:  \n     `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`  \n     - **`unidade_logico`** (Portuguese for \"logical unit\") is a non-standard, custom directory name, which is highly unusual for legitimate system services.\n     - **`tarefa_logico.exe`** (Portuguese for \"logical task\") is not a known legitimate file. This could be a backdoor, malware, or a custom payload.\n\n2. **Repetition of PowerShell Commands**:\n   - The same `New-Service` and `Start-Service` commands are repeated multiple times. This may indicate:\n     - **Persistence**: The attacker is ensuring the service is created and started, even if the system reboots.\n     - **Automation**: The script may be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., post-exploitation, lateral movement).\n\n3. **Non-Standard Behavior**:\n   - **Service Name and Path**: The service name and directory structure (`unidade_logico`) are not typical for Windows services. This is a strong indicator of **malicious activity**.\n   - **Execution Policy**: The use of `Restricted` execution policy in PowerShell might be a misconfiguration or an attempt to bypass security controls (though `Restricted` should prevent script execution unless explicitly allowed).\n\n4. **Test Output**:\n   - The script writes **`Final result: 1`** to the host. This could be:\n     - A **test signal** to confirm the script executed successfully.\n     - A **flag** for external actors to monitor the success of the operation.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Installation**: The `tarefa_logico.exe` file could be malware (e.g., a backdoor, keylogger, or ransomware).\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The service creation is a common technique used by attackers to maintain access to a system.\n- **Lateral Movement**: The script might be part of a broader attack (e.g., deploying malware across the network).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Immediate Actions**:\n   - **Isolate the Host**: If the system is part of a network, isolate it to prevent lateral movement.\n   - **Check for `tarefa_logico.exe`**:  \n     - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the file.\n     - Submit the file to **VirusTotal** for reputation checks.\n   - **Review the `unidade_logico` Directory**:  \n     - Investigate the contents of `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\` for other suspicious files.\n\n2. **Log Analysis**:\n   - **Correlate Events**: Check for other logs (e.g., network traffic, registry changes) that might indicate additional malicious activity.\n   - **Search for Similar Commands**: Look for other PowerShell scripts that use `New-Service` or `Start-Service` in unusual contexts.\n\n3. **System Hardening**:\n   - **Restrict PowerShell Usage**: Enforce stricter execution policies (e.g., `AllSigned` or `RemoteSigned`).\n   - **Monitor for Service Creation**: Use tools like **Sysmon** or **SIEM** to alert on unexpected service creation.\n\n4. **Incident Response**:\n   - If `tarefa_logico.exe` is confirmed malicious, perform a full system scan and consider reimaging the host.\n   - Check for other systems in the network that may have been compromised using the same script or payload.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries strongly suggest **malicious activity** involving the deployment of a suspicious service. Immediate investigation of the `tarefa_logico.exe` file and the associated directory is critical to determine the scope of the threat and prevent further compromise."}

The first few entries have the command line \"Write-Host 'Final result: 1'\", which seems pretty benign. It's just outputting a message. But then, later on, there are several instances where the PowerShell command is scanning INF files in the Windows directory. \n\nThe command here is checking for sections in INF files that match certain patterns like [defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]. That part stands out because INF files are typically used for installing drivers or other system components. If a script is scanning these files, maybe looking for specific sections, that could be part of a larger process. \n\nNow, the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which is the default. That means it's not allowing scripts to run unless they're signed or come from a trusted source. But the fact that the script is running under Restricted might be a red flag if it's doing something unusual. However, the commands themselves don't seem to be malicious at first glance. They're just checking for the presence of certain sections in INF files.\n\nBut wait, why would someone run a script that scans INF files like that? Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, like checking for driver installations. However, the repetition of the same command multiple times could indicate something. If this is a normal operation, why are there so many repeated entries? Maybe the system is generating these logs as part of a scan, but the sheer number might be suspicious. \n\nAlso, the task in the winlog alternates between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. Not sure what those tasks mean exactly, but if they're part of a normal process, that might be okay. However, the combination of scanning INF files and the repetition could be a sign of something trying to detect or exploit vulnerabilities related to driver installations. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the script is using Get-Content to read the INF files. If the script is reading a lot of INF files, maybe it's looking for something specific. The regex pattern [defaultinstall.nt...] is used in INF files for different architectures. If the script is checking for these sections, it might be trying to determine if certain drivers are present, which could be part of a legitimate check, but also could be part of a malicious process trying to find vulnerabilities in the driver installation process.\n\nHowever, none of the commands here actually execute any harmful actions. They just read the files and output a result. So, without additional context, like other processes or files being modified, it's hard to say if this is malicious. But the fact that the same command is repeated multiple times and the scanning of INF files might be worth further investigation. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think this is interesting enough to warrant a closer look. The classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6. It's not definitively malicious, but the pattern of scanning INF files repeatedly could be a sign of something that needs checking.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repetitive PowerShell commands scanning Windows INF files for architecture-specific installation sections may indicate reconnaissance for driver exploitation or system compromise, though no direct malicious action is observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
