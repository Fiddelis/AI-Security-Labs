So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands being executed. Each of these commands is creating a scheduled task using the Register-ScheduledTask cmdlet. The command lines are similar, with the main difference being the task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The tasks are set to trigger at logon, run as Administrators with the highest privileges, and execute calc.exe. \n\nNow, why is that suspicious? Well, creating scheduled tasks that run with high privileges, especially at logon, can be a sign of persistence mechanisms used by malware. The fact that they're using PowerShell to create these tasks is common in attacks, as PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be abused. Also, the use of the BUILTIN\\Administrators group suggests that the task has elevated permissions, which is a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries for the same type of command, which might indicate an attempt to create multiple tasks, possibly to ensure that the malicious activity persists even if one task is removed. The repetition could be part of a broader attack strategy.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign explanations. For example, maybe this is part of a legitimate script that's creating test tasks. But the use of calc.exe as the payload is a bit odd. Normally, calc.exe is a simple calculator and is often used as a placeholder in examples or for testing. However, in a real-world scenario, using calc.exe in a scheduled task that runs at logon with admin rights is highly unusual and likely malicious.\n\nAlso, there are other events related to PowerShell, like registry value sets and process accesses, which might be part of the same malicious activity. The image loaded events pointing to .NET DLLs could be part of the PowerShell execution, but they don't immediately indicate a threat unless there's something anomalous about the loading.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated creation of high-privilege scheduled tasks with PowerShell, using calc.exe as the action, and the multiple entries suggest a potential security threat. The confidence here is pretty high because these are classic indicators of compromise. However, I can't be 100% certain without more context, so a confidence level around 0.9 makes sense.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) under the Administrators group, triggering at logon and executing calc.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are all legitimate system files, part of .NET and Windows Defender. Loading these doesn't seem suspicious on its own. But then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute something temporarily. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of a command or payload.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell is used to create a scheduled task with the action of running calc.exe, which is a simple calculator. However, the trigger is at logon, and it's set to run as Administrators with the highest privileges. That's a red flag because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be an attempt to persist access or execute commands with elevated rights. The command line shows the use of New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are PowerShell cmdlets that can be abused for malicious purposes.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. While registry changes can be normal, having multiple entries from Chrome might be part of legitimate updates or extensions. However, without more context, it's hard to tell, but they don't seem as suspicious as the PowerShell events.\n\nThe later entries have process \"None\" with tasks like \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's concerning because it suggests that there might be remote code execution happening, but the process field is missing, which could mean the event is incomplete or the process isn't logged properly. However, if these are legitimate remote commands (like from a remote desktop or a service), they might not be malicious. But repeated entries like this could indicate something like a brute force attack or unauthorized access attempts.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation with admin rights, are a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The temporary file creation and deletion is another sign. The Chrome registry changes are less clear but not necessarily malicious. The \"Execute a Remote Command\" events without a process might be part of a larger attack vector, but their relevance depends on context not provided here. However, the scheduled task with elevated privileges is a significant red flag. \n\nConfidence level: I'd say around 0.7 because while there are clear suspicious activities (scheduled task, temp file), some events are ambiguous (Chrome registry changes, remote commands without process info). But the combination of PowerShell activities and the scheduled task is enough to flag this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior: loading system DLLs, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, and attempting to register a scheduled task with elevated privileges (Administrators group, RunLevel Highest) to execute calc.exe. This suggests potential privilege escalation or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to check all the events together.\n\nMost of the entries have \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task. That's a red flag because executing remote commands can be part of an attack, like someone trying to run malicious code. But there are a lot of them, and some might be normal. However, looking closer, there's an event where a PowerShell command is creating a scheduled task with \"calc.exe\" and setting the principal to Administrators. That's suspicious because using the highest run level and administrators group could be an attempt to escalate privileges or persist on the system.\n\nThen there's an entry where svchost.exe is creating a file in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum\". That's a common place for scheduled tasks, but combined with the PowerShell event, it might indicate a scheduled task being created. Also, the file creation in the user's AppData folder for PowerShell startup profiles could be a sign of persistence or configuration changes.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of Windows Defender, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a sign of tampering. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating a YAML file in the Downloads directory might be normal if it's part of a log setup, but if it's unexpected, it could be an indicator of something else.\n\nHowever, some of the events are just registry changes or image loads, which can be normal system activity. The challenge is distinguishing between benign and malicious. But the combination of multiple remote command executions, the scheduled task creation with admin rights, and the file creations in sensitive areas like System32 and Tasks might indicate a coordinated attack. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be false positives or legitimate, but the cluster of suspicious activities points towards an interesting case for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity including repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks, PowerShell creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, svchost.exe creating files in system directories, and chrome.exe loading potentially malicious DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a list of events in JSONL format. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about chrome.exe performing Registry value set operations. There are eight instances of that. Then there's one Dns query from chrome.exe and two file creations: one by winlogbeat.exe and another by powershell.exe.\n\nHmm, chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. That's unusual because Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much. Maybe it's a red flag. But wait, could there be a legitimate reason? Maybe some extension or a sync feature? Not sure. But multiple registry changes could indicate something malicious, like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nThen there's the Dns query. That might be normal if Chrome is looking up domains, but combined with the registry changes, it's suspicious. The file creations: winlogbeat.exe is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation. The powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads folder could be benign, but maybe it's part of a script that's doing something else. However, alone, that might not be too concerning.\n\nBut the key point here is the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe. Malware often modifies the registry to persist after reboots or to change system settings. If this is happening multiple times, it might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. However, I need to check if there's any other context. For example, if the user is running some legitimate software that interacts with the registry, but the data here doesn't show that.\n\nThe confidence level is a bit tricky. There's a pattern here, but without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or the process's command-line arguments, it's hard to be certain. However, the repetition of the same event (Registry value set by chrome.exe) eight times is a strong indicator. The presence of a Dns query could be related to C2 communication, but again, without more info, it's speculative.\n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING because of the unusual number of registry modifications by chrome.exe, which could be a sign of malicious activity. The justification is the repeated registry changes, which are suspicious. Confidence is around 0.7 because while it's a strong indicator, there's a possibility of false positives, but the pattern is significant enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated 'Registry value set' operations, which is unusual behavior for a browser and may indicate persistence attempts or malicious registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
