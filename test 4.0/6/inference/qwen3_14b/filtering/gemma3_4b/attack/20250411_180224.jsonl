So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too bad on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe process that runs schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line here is important. It's creating a task that runs powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the file isn't present, which might be a red flag. The task is set to run daily under the system account. That's suspicious because creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges and a non-existent script could be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task again, same command line. Then there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. Scheduled tasks are often used by malware to persist, so that's a concern. Also, the same task is queried later, which might be checking if it was created successfully.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of registry value sets, but the key part is the scheduled task creation. The fact that the script file doesn't exist but the task is set up to run it could indicate that the attacker is trying to execute a script that's not yet present, possibly planning to upload it later. Also, using the system account for the task gives it high privileges, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nOther entries involve svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry changes, but those might be normal unless there's a pattern. However, the main suspicious activity is the scheduled task creation with a non-existent script and the file creation in the Tasks directory. The presence of multiple schtasks.exe processes creating the same task might be an attempt to ensure the task is set up even if the first attempt failed.\n\nThe confidence here is medium to high. The justification is the creation of a scheduled task with a non-existent script and elevated privileges, which is a common indicator of compromise. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution yet, but the setup is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled task creations using schtasks.exe with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1) and elevated privileges (system account), combined with file creation in the Windows Tasks directory, indicate potential persistence mechanism setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting. Let's go through each line.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads folder. That's a legitimate process, part of Elastic's Beats, used for logging. Creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration, but maybe normal.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe created 'entrada_ativo.txt' in Downloads. PowerShell is common, but creating a file here could be benign, like a script saving output. But maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe had a ProcessAccess event. Not sure what that means. Maybe another process accessed it? But without more info, hard to tell.\n\nFourth event: whoami.exe was executed. That's a normal command to get user info. Usually not suspicious on its own.\n\nFifth event: Another ProcessAccess by powershell.exe. Again, not sure. Maybe accessing another process, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at all together: The main thing is that there's a mix of normal processes. Winlogbeat and PowerShell are common. The files created are in Downloads, which is typical for user activities. No signs of malware or unusual behavior. No errors or unexpected processes. The events don't show any malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive files. The confidence is low because there's nothing here that stands out as malicious. So classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe) performing normal file operations or process access in user directories. No suspicious behavior, malware indicators, or security-relevant anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
