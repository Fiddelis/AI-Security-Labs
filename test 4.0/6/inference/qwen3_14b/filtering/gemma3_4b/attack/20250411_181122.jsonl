The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is executed. That's a normal Windows command to get user info, so not suspicious on its own. But then there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' events. Let me check the command lines.\n\nOne of the processes has a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems like a password search, which could be part of a malicious activity, like trying to find credentials. However, it's also possible that this is a legitimate script, maybe part of a security check or a user's own script. But repeated execution might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell. That could indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which might be normal, but combined with other actions, it could be suspicious. \n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs. Those are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. But if an attacker is using PowerShell to load malicious code, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are all standard Windows directories, so maybe not.\n\nThere's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing malicious code, that's a concern. However, the file name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which might be related to PowerShell execution policy testing, which could be legitimate.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be part of inter-process communication, which is normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nNow, considering all these together: multiple PowerShell processes running with a command that searches for passwords, accessing the registry, loading .NET components, creating and deleting temporary files. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be related to PowerShell's internal operations. \n\nBut is this enough to be considered interesting? The command line is searching for passwords, which could be part of a credential harvesting attempt. However, without more context like network activity, unauthorized access, or other malicious behaviors, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple events might indicate that the system is being probed, but it's also possible that this is a legitimate script run by a user or a security tool.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. If this were a single event, maybe lower, but with multiple instances and the password search, it's more suspicious. However, without evidence of actual malicious activity beyond the search, it's not definitive. So I'd lean towards 'INTERESTING' but with moderate confidence, as it shows potential for malicious behavior but isn't conclusive on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executed with command-line patterns searching for 'password' in files, combined with process access, registry modifications, and temporary file creation\/deletion.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of powershell.exe activities. One of the entries has a command line that uses findstr and select-string with patterns looking for \"pass\" and \"password\" in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to search for passwords in files. That's a red flag because it could indicate an attempt to find sensitive information on the system.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that the same command line appears multiple times in different events. The task associated with some of these is \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle,\" which might be normal, but combined with the command line, it's suspicious. Also, there's a file created event for a winlogbeat configuration file, which is a log shipper. Maybe someone is setting up data collection, but that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nThere are also entries for other processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, and chrome.exe, but those are common and don't seem unusual. The svchost.exe and OfficeClickToRun.exe entries are also normal. However, the repeated use of powershell.exe with the specific command to search for passwords stands out. \n\nI should consider if this is a legitimate activity. Maybe a user is trying to find passwords in their own files, but that's rare. More likely, this could be part of a script or tool that's searching for sensitive data, which might be part of a security test or a malicious activity like data exfiltration. Since the logs show multiple instances of this command, it's more likely to be intentional and possibly malicious.\n\nThe presence of the command line that searches for passwords across various file types suggests that someone is trying to gather sensitive information. Even though there's no direct evidence of exfiltration or malware, the repeated use of this command in PowerShell is suspicious. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for 'pass' and 'password' patterns across files, which may indicate an attempt to locate sensitive information on the system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to chrome.exe performing various tasks like setting registry values, making DNS queries, and network connections. There's also an entry where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these files might be normal if chrome is interacting with the antivirus, but sometimes malicious software can mimic legitimate processes. However, just loading these DLLs isn't necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file called objeto_logico.txt. That's a normal file creation, but if there's no other context, it's not necessarily malicious. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing scripts, that could be a red flag. But in this batch, it's just a single file creation.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs, so that's probably normal. But the same file path appears twice, which might just be a repeated event.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. There are multiple entries of chrome.exe doing registry modifications and DNS queries. A lot of registry changes could indicate something trying to modify system settings, which is a common tactic for malware. However, Chrome itself might modify the registry for its own purposes, like setting preferences or handling updates. But the sheer number of events might be worth looking into.\n\nThe DNS queries are also common, but if they're going to suspicious domains, that would be a problem. However, the logs here don't specify the domains, so I can't tell from this data alone.\n\nThe network connections are also numerous, but again, Chrome regularly connects to the internet. However, if there's an unusual pattern or volume, that could be a sign of something wrong. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key point here is that all the events are related to legitimate processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal activities. There's no obvious sign of malware, like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or connections to known malicious IPs. The only thing that stands out is the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe, but that's not necessarily malicious. Without more context or indicators of compromise, it's hard to classify this as interesting. However, since there's a lot of activity, maybe it's worth a closer look. But based on the given data, I think it's more on the side of normal, unless there's something I'm missing.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal operations like DNS queries, registry modifications, and file creation.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file in the Downloads folder. That's not necessarily bad, but then there's another entry where winlogbeat.exe created a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of normal operations. But then there's a lot of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. Multiple times, the same process is accessed. That could be normal, but maybe not.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. But then there's cmd.exe running schtasks commands to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks might be suspicious if it's part of removing something malicious, but without context, it's hard to tell. However, the command line here is using schtasks \/delete with specific task names. If these tasks were set up by an attacker, deleting them could be part of cleaning up.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of schtasks.exe being run with delete commands. That's a red flag. Scheduled tasks can be used by attackers to persist on a system, so deleting them might indicate an attempt to remove traces. Also, the use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe multiple times, especially with ProcessAccess events, might suggest that someone is trying to manipulate processes or inject code.\n\nAnother thing is the registry events. There are several Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of configuring the system, but if done by an attacker, it could be to disable security features or set up persistence. The fact that multiple processes are accessing the registry might indicate some kind of configuration change.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware here, like file downloads from suspicious sources or network connections. The main suspicious activities are the deletion of scheduled tasks and multiple process accesses. But since these are all system processes and common commands, it's possible that this is just normal user activity or system maintenance.\n\nBut wait, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks and multiple process accesses could be part of an attack. For example, an attacker might create a scheduled task to execute malicious code, then delete it after to avoid detection. But in the logs provided, the deletion is happening, but there's no evidence of the task being created. So maybe the attacker is trying to remove their own tasks, but that's speculative.\n\nOverall, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe and the deletion of scheduled tasks might be worth investigating. It's not conclusive, but there's enough suspicious activity to flag this as interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: repeated 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe, deletion of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is WMIC.exe running a command to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems suspicious because WMIC is often used in attacks. Then there are multiple Image Load events for WMIC loading dlls like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender, so loading that might be an attempt to bypass security features.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity with PowerShell and cmd.exe, including deleting user accounts and modifying the registry. The command to delete users with net.exe and cmd.exe could be part of an attack to remove administrative accounts. The repeated Process Access and Registry Event entries for PowerShell and other processes might indicate someone trying to maintain persistence or alter system settings.\n\nAlso, there are events related to User Account Management and Security Group Management, which could be part of elevating privileges or modifying permissions. The combination of these activities—using WMIC to delete processes, loading suspicious dlls, and modifying system accounts and registry—points towards a potential security breach. The confidence is high because the actions are indicative of malicious behavior trying to compromise the system.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: WMIC.exe deleting processes, loading potentially malicious DLLs (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), PowerShell\/cmd.exe modifying registry and deleting user accounts, and security-related process accesses.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look for any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activity. Some of the commands stand out, like \"net user ... \/del \/domain\" which is deleting user accounts. That's a red flag because deleting user accounts can be part of a privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack. Also, there's a \"sc delete win32times\" command, which deletes a service. Deleting services might be an attempt to remove malicious software or hide the attack's footprint.\n\nThen there's the use of \"whoami.exe\" which is normal for checking the current user, but combined with other commands, it might be part of reconnaissance. The repeated access to processes via \"Process accessed\" events could indicate someone trying to manipulate or monitor other processes. \n\nRegistry value changes are frequent here. Modifying the registry can be used to persist malware or change system configurations. The fact that multiple registry events are logged, especially with different processes, might indicate an attacker trying to maintain access or alter system behavior.\n\nI also notice the use of \"conhost.exe\" and \"services.exe\" which are legitimate system processes, but their involvement in registry changes might be suspicious if they're doing something unusual. However, the main concern here is the deletion of user accounts and services, which are more directly indicative of malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of user account deletion, service deletion, and multiple registry modifications suggests potential malicious activity.

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a cmd.exe process that's running a command to delete some temporary files. The command line shows it's using 'del' to remove files in the Temp directory. That might be normal cleanup, but sometimes malicious software deletes files to cover tracks. However, just deleting temp files isn't necessarily bad. I need to check other events.\n\nNext, there are several entries involving powershell.exe with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing scripts, so that's a red flag. The repeated ProcessAccess events might indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate processes, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there's a File Delete event where a specific executable is deleted from the Temp directory. The path is 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe'. The name 'decoded' might suggest that this file was part of a decoded payload, which is common in malware. Deleting it after execution could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events for PowerShell, it's loading several .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so PowerShell using them is normal. But if there's an unusual pattern here, maybe? However, the presence of these DLLs alone isn't suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but if they're occurring in large numbers, it could indicate automated scripts or attacks.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The combination of PowerShell being used multiple times, registry value changes, file deletions, and the presence of decoded files in the Temp directory might indicate a malicious activity. The deletion of the decoded executable after running could be part of a payload execution. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, just suspicious activities. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these actions could be part of legitimate processes, but the combination does raise flags.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions 'Image loaded' for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script. But then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be suspicious because creating and deleting a script quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nNext, there's a 'Pipe Created' event, but no file involved. Not sure about that yet. Then some 'Engine Lifecycle' events, which might be normal. Another image loaded for MpClient.dll, also part of Windows Defender. That's probably okay.\n\nThen there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be related to PowerShell's startup scripts. Then some registry value set events, but not sure if they're malicious. There's also a 'Process accessed' event multiple times for PowerShell and other processes like whoami.exe. \n\nWhoami.exe is a legitimate tool that displays user information, but if it's being called repeatedly, maybe that's part of a script. However, the main thing here is the creation and deletion of the temporary .ps1 file. That could indicate someone trying to run a script and then cleaning up. Also, the fact that PowerShell is accessing processes multiple times might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a larger attack.\n\nBut wait, there are also entries for winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably part of normal operations. However, the .yml.new file might be a configuration file being written, which is normal during setup.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious part is the temporary script file being created and then deleted. That could be an indicator of malicious activity, like downloading and executing a script. However, since the script was deleted, it's harder to analyze. The multiple 'Process accessed' events might be normal if the system is just running legitimate scripts, but combined with the file creation\/deletion, it's worth looking into.\n\nI should check if the files mentioned are known good. MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are part of Windows Defender, so those are benign. The Temp file with the .ps1 extension is more concerning. Also, the repeated use of whoami.exe might be part of a script that's checking user context, which is common in both benign and malicious scripts.\n\nConfidence-wise, it's not 100% certain, but the combination of the temporary script and multiple process accesses suggests something might be going on.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the whole batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and a confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events to see if there's anything suspicious. Let me go through each line. \n\nThe first event is 'whoami.exe' being created. That's a normal Windows command, so probably benign. Then there's 'powershell.exe' being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is common, but if it's being used for something malicious, that could be a sign. However, just accessing it isn't necessarily bad. \n\nNext, 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'notepad.exe' with registry value changes. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's normal. Notepad is also a standard app. The registry changes might be normal too, like during updates or configuration changes. \n\nThen there's 'calc.exe' (calculator) loading 'urlmon.dll'. Wait, urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer, so that's a legitimate file. But why is it being loaded by calc.exe? Hmm, maybe not a big deal, but could be part of a larger pattern. \n\nThere's 'svchost.exe' with registry changes multiple times. Svchost is a standard Windows process that hosts services. Registry changes here could be normal, but if there are too many, maybe not. \n\nThen there's 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating a configuration file, that's normal. The file path seems legitimate. \n\nLooking again, there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed, but no specific commands or suspicious arguments. The 'whoami.exe' is run, which is just displaying user info. \n\nThe 'chrome.exe' entries show DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries could be normal browsing, but if they're going to suspicious domains, that's a red flag. However, the data here doesn't specify the domains or IPs involved. \n\nI need to check if there's any combination of events that might indicate a security threat. For example, if there's a process that's being created or accessed in an unusual way, or if there are multiple events pointing to the same suspicious activity. \n\nLooking at the 'Image loaded' events, both 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' (which might be the same) loaded 'urlmon.dll'. That's a legitimate DLL, so that's probably okay. \n\nThe 'Registry value set' events are spread across various processes, but without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. \n\nThe only thing that stands out is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a new configuration file. However, that's part of normal operation when setting up or updating the software. \n\nSince there's no evidence of malicious activity, like unexpected network connections to known bad IPs, unusual process creation, or exploitation of vulnerabilities, the events seem to be part of normal system operations. \n\nTherefore, the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" because none of the events indicate a security threat. The confidence might be around 0.7, as there's no clear malicious activity, but the presence of PowerShell and some registry changes could be a minor red herring. However, without more context, the events don't point to a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent standard system operations (e.g., legitimate processes like whoami.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe) and benign file interactions (e.g., urlmon.dll loading).
