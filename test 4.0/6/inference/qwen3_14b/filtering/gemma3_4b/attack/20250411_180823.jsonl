The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. Multiple network connections from chrome might be part of regular browsing, but maybe if there's an unusual number, but the logs don't specify volume here. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, handling app permissions, so registry changes could be normal. Notepad.exe modifying the registry is less common, but maybe part of user actions. Not sure yet.\n\nPowerShell.exe being accessed and process access events. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. Need to check for unusual commands or parameters, but the logs don't show the command lines here except for some entries.\n\nLooking at calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL used for internet operations, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected place or in an unusual context, that could be a red flag. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location. So maybe that's normal.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line shows creating tasks named \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\" that run calc.exe. Scheduled tasks created on logon or startup could be suspicious, especially if they're running calc.exe, which is a simple calculator. But why would someone create a scheduled task to run calc.exe? That seems odd. Maybe a sign of malicious activity, like trying to execute a payload through a scheduled task.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same calc.exe command. Creating multiple scheduled tasks with similar names and using calc.exe might be an attempt to persist or execute code. Also, the task is set to run as the system user, which could be a sign of privilege escalation.\n\nThe svchost.exe processes modifying the registry multiple times. Svchost is a legitimate host process for Windows services, but excessive registry changes could indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation event for a task in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon. Scheduled tasks are usually stored in that directory, so that's normal. But the name \"pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\" seems like it might be a generated name, possibly indicating automated or malicious task creation.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of multiple scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe and cmd.exe to run calc.exe, along with the unusual task names and possibly the use of system user privileges, might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. Even though some components are legitimate, the combination of these events could be suspicious. However, without more context or anomalies in the commands, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled task creations (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon', 'modulo_principal_005_OnStartup') using cmd.exe to execute calc.exe, which may indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute payloads.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there are a lot of svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and powershell.exe. svchost is a normal Windows process, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be a red flag. However, the majority of the events here are registry value sets, which could be normal or could be part of a malicious activity.\n\nWait, there's one event where a file is created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup'. Creating a task in the System32 directory might be suspicious. That's a common place for malware to create startup entries. Also, the filename 'pacote_ativo_005' doesn't look like a standard Windows task name. That could be a sign of something malicious trying to persist after a reboot.\n\nThen there's another file created by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\unidade_ativo.txt'. Creating a text file might not be too suspicious on its own, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing malicious code, that's a problem. However, just creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. Maybe it's just a log file or something benign.\n\nAnother point is the image loaded by chrome.exe pointing to 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll'. Wait, that's a legitimate Windows Defender file. But why is chrome.exe loading it? Maybe that's normal if chrome is interacting with the antivirus, but I'm not sure. It might not be a big red flag.\n\nThere's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal if the user is configuring it. But again, not necessarily suspicious.\n\nNow, the key thing here is the creation of the task in the System32\\Tasks directory. That's a high-risk area for persistence mechanisms. Even though there are a lot of registry changes, which could be normal, the specific file creation in that location stands out. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes by svchost and chrome might be part of a larger attack, like modifying registry keys to disable security features or set up persistence.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. The other events are mostly registry changes and image loads of legitimate DLLs. The file created by powershell is a text file, which might be a red herring. However, the task creation seems more concerning. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the creation of a startup task in a system directory, combined with multiple registry modifications by processes like svchost and chrome, might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. That would make this batch interesting for investigation. The confidence is moderate because while the task creation is suspicious, without more context (like the content of the file or other malicious activities), it's not definitive. But the presence of that specific file creation is a strong indicator.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A suspicious file was created in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup), which is a common technique for persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a series of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each line.\n\nFirst, there are six entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Chrome modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad, but doing it multiple times might be suspicious. However, Chrome does have legitimate reasons to modify the registry, like updating settings or handling extensions. But repeating the same action six times could indicate something automated or possibly malicious.\n\nThen there's an entry for powershell.exe with \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common legitimate tool. Just accessing a process isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it might be a sign.\n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user information, so that's probably normal. But if it's being run in an unusual context, maybe not. However, here it's just the ProcessCreate event, which is normal.\n\nAnother powershell.exe entry with ProcessAccess again. So two instances of PowerShell being accessed. Maybe not enough on their own, but combined with the Chrome events?\n\nNow, considering all together: multiple Chrome registry changes and PowerShell access. But are these events in a pattern that suggests compromise? For example, if Chrome was modifying the registry to inject code or change settings, but the logs don't show specific registry keys or values. The events are generic. The PowerShell access could be part of normal operations, but without more context like unusual command lines or unexpected processes, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same event (Chrome modifying registry) six times might be a red flag. Maybe a script or malware is repeatedly making changes. But without more details, like which registry keys are being modified, it's hard to be certain. The justification would be that there's a pattern of repeated registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell activity, which could be benign or malicious. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. Alternatively, the repetition might warrant further investigation.\n\nHmm, the confidence here is a bit low. The events are not clearly malicious, but the repetition could be a sign. However, without more context, it's not enough to classify as interesting. Maybe the answer is not interesting, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe the combination is suspicious enough. I'll have to go with \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, but the justification would be the repeated registry changes and PowerShell access, which could indicate automated or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances modifying registry values repeatedly, combined with PowerShell process access events, suggests potential automated activity or exploitation attempts. While some events may be benign, the pattern warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
