{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and processes being created, like whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The command line for one of the cmd.exe processes stands out. It has a command that uses 'sc create' to set up a service with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist. The path is 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and another similar one. That seems suspicious because creating a service that points to a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute malicious code later. Also, the use of 'sc create' and then 'sc qc' to check the service configuration is something that could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there's the event where sc.exe is used again to create another service with a different non-existent script path. That's another red flag. Services are typically legitimate, but creating them with non-existent paths could be a way to hide malicious activities or set up a backdoor.\n\nLooking at the registry events: several processes are setting registry values. While some registry changes are normal, the frequency here might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The 'Registry value set' events could be part of normal operations, but combined with the service creation attempts, it might be more concerning.\n\nThere's also an image loaded event for urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL, but the fact that it's loaded by Calculator.exe and svchost.exe might be normal. However, if there's a pattern of unexpected image loads, that could be a sign of something malicious. But in this case, the paths are legitimate system paths, so maybe that's okay.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. However, the presence of .yml.new suggests that maybe the configuration is being modified or set up, which could be part of a legitimate installation or a potential compromise. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the key suspicious activities are the use of 'sc create' with non-existent script paths. This is a common technique in malware to set up persistence by creating services that execute malicious scripts. Even though the scripts don't exist now, the attacker might plan to place them later. Also, the multiple process creations and registry changes could be part of establishing a foothold or modifying system settings for persistence.\n\nHowever, there are no direct signs of successful malicious activity, like file access to known malicious files or network connections. The events are more about process creation and configuration changes. The confidence here might be around 0.7 because while the actions are suspicious, they could be part of a legitimate process if, for example, the user is setting up services for a specific purpose. But the non-existent script paths and the repeated service creation attempts lean towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Use of 'sc create' to register services with non-existent script paths (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), suggesting potential persistence mechanism setup. 2) Repeated process creation of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry modification events, which may indicate lateral movement or configuration changes. 3) Unusual combination of service creation and registry events that could signal malicious persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe all have registry value set events. That's normal, right? Those processes are common and might legitimately modify the registry. But then there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. Hmm, but that's not unusual either. \n\nThen, chrome.exe shows up multiple times with registry value set events. A lot of them. Wait, there are 8 entries for chrome.exe with Registry value set. That's a lot. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, or maybe it's normal? I need to think. But then there are two Image loaded events for chrome.exe. The files mentioned are amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. But why would chrome.exe load those? Typically, those DLLs are loaded by the system or other security software. If chrome.exe is loading them, maybe that's a sign of something malicious. Like, maybe the process is being compromised, or there's a malicious DLL being loaded. \n\nBut wait, are these legitimate? Could Chrome be interacting with Defender's components? Maybe not. Those DLLs are usually loaded by the system or other trusted processes. If chrome.exe is loading them, that might be suspicious. Especially if it's not the usual behavior. Also, the fact that there are so many registry changes by chrome.exe might indicate some kind of configuration change or persistence mechanism. \n\nLooking at the other processes, like powershell.exe having Process accessed events. That's a common event and might not be suspicious on its own. But combined with the chrome.exe events, maybe there's a connection. However, there's no direct link between the processes here. \n\nSo, the main red flags here are the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and the loading of Defender-related DLLs by chrome.exe. Those are unusual and could indicate malicious activity, such as a compromised browser or an attempt to bypass security features. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Are there any other possibilities? Maybe the user is running some scripts or extensions that modify the registry. But the loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll is still concerning. Those are security-related DLLs, and if they're being loaded by chrome.exe, it might be an attempt to disable or interfere with them. \n\nSo, considering all that, this batch does show some suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. The classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.75. There's enough unusual activity here to flag it, but not definitive proof of a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances trigger registry modifications and load security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which is unusual for a browser and may indicate evasion techniques or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
