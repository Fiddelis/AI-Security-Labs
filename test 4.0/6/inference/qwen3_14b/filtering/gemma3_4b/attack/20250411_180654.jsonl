So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Multiple times, but chrome doing registry changes might be normal, especially if it's updating settings or extensions. But repeated entries could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a standard command to get user info, so probably legitimate. The command line shows it's just running whoami, which is normal.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystrokes could imply keylogging, which is malicious. The log path is set to $env:TEMP\\key.log, which is a common place for malware to store data. This seems like a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Loaded events for .NET DLLs. While loading .NET assemblies isn't unusual, the combination with the keystroke logging script might be part of a larger attack. The presence of multiple Image Load events could indicate that the PowerShell process is loading additional components, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nAlso, there are several ProcessAccess events for PowerShell. These might be normal, but when combined with the keystroke logging, it could suggest that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which is a sign of something wrong.\n\nThe repetition of the same command lines for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths (elemento_secundario, entrada_padrao) might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute the same malicious script from different locations, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the keystroke logging script, the multiple Image Loads of .NET DLLs, and the repeated PowerShell activities. These are all signs of potential malware, specifically a keylogger. Even though some events might be normal, the combination here is strong enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) with log paths in $env:TEMP, combined with .NET DLL image loads and repeated registry modifications, indicating potential keylogging\/malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious patterns across all the events.\n\nFirst, I notice that several entries have the command line involving 'powershell.exe' executing a script called 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with a log path pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds familiarâ€”it's commonly associated with keylogging malware. The fact that it's being run multiple times from different paths might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing the file location each time.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a creation and deletion of temporary files, which is normal, but the repeated execution of the same script from various directories is a red flag. Also, the 'Execute a Remote Command' event with a path to another 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' script suggests that the attacker might be using remote execution to deploy the malware.\n\nThe presence of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in the winlog entries could be related to the malware's lifecycle management. Additionally, the 'Pipe Created' event might indicate inter-process communication, which is sometimes used by malware to coordinate activities.\n\nHowever, there are also benign events like 'Image loaded' for legitimate Windows Defender DLLs and 'File created' for temporary files generated by PowerShell. These are normal operations, but the key here is the combination with the suspicious script executions.\n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated execution of the same malicious script from different paths, along with the lifecycle events, points towards a potential security threat. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence is high because the indicators are strong, but not 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' script from varying paths with $env:TEMP\\\\key.log logging, suggesting potential keylogging malware. Repeated execution patterns and lifecycle events indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows Delivery Optimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate system process that hosts various Windows services. The file path mentioned is under the NetworkService's AppData, which is a common location for system-related files. The filename is keyValueLKG.dat, which doesn't ring any bells as malicious. This seems like a normal system activity, maybe related to Windows Update or Delivery Optimization. So, probably not suspicious here.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for collecting and forwarding logs. The file path shows a .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration setup. Since the user is in the Downloads folder, it's possible they're installing or configuring Winlogbeat manually. This looks like a normal user activity, especially if the user is an admin setting up monitoring. No obvious signs of compromise here.\n\nThird event is powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads directory. PowerShell is a common tool, and creating a text file isn't unusual. The filename is entrada_padrao.txt, which translates to \"default input.txt\" in Portuguese. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but this could be a user creating a script or a log file. However, since it's in the Downloads folder, maybe it's part of a normal workflow. Still, PowerShell is sometimes used in attacks, but a single file creation isn't enough to raise a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together, all three events involve legitimate processes creating files in typical locations. There's no indication of unusual behavior like unexpected file types, hidden processes, or network activity. The processes mentioned are all known and used in normal system operations. The files created are either system-related or user-initiated configurations. No anomalies detected across the batch. Therefore, this batch is likely not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in typical locations (system directories, user Downloads folder) with no suspicious patterns detected. File creation is consistent with normal system and user activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
