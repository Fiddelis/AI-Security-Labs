{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by scanning through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with network connections. That's normal, maybe, but not suspicious on its own. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed a few times. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but again, not necessarily bad. \n\nWait, here's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. The command line looks like it's compiling some code and then executing a temporary file. That seems a bit odd. Compiling code in temp directories might be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers use this to execute malicious code.\n\nThen there's csc.exe creating files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating executable files in temp folders can be a red flag. Also, the File Executable Detected event for unidade_padrao.exe might indicate a new executable being placed, which could be malicious.\n\nNext, several ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads, especially from temp files, might be suspicious. The process names like modulo_secundario.exe and estrutura_ativo.exe don't seem standard, which could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAlso, the command line for cmd.exe includes a path with \"modulo_secundario\" and \"estrutura_temporario,\" which might be obfuscated or part of a larger malicious payload. The use of temporary directories and executing compiled code from there is a common tactic in malware.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple processes creating and executing files in temp directories, unusual process names, and the use of compilers and execution from temp files. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate (like chrome and powershell), the combination of these events, especially the creation of executables in temp folders and the image loads from non-standard paths, suggests this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: compilation of code in temp directories using csc.exe, execution of generated executables (e.g., 'unidade_padrao.exe'), loading of non-standard DLLs from temp paths, and unusual process names suggesting potential malware execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: tarefa_base.exe loaded clrjit.dll. Hmm, clrjit.dll is part of the .NET framework, so that's a legitimate system file. The process name is tarefa_base.exe, which might be a normal process, but I'm not sure. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nSecond event: elemento_ativo.exe terminated. Process termination is normal, but the name is a bit generic. Maybe a legitimate process, but could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe set a registry value. Cmd.exe is a common tool, but registry changes can be suspicious. However, if it's part of a normal script, maybe not. Need to check if there's a pattern here.\n\nFourth event: conhost.exe set registry. Conhost is a Windows process related to console windows. Setting registry values might be normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nFifth event: notepad.exe set registry. Notepad is usually harmless, but registry changes could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nSixth event: powershell.exe accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. Process access might be normal, but need to check for any unusual activity.\n\nSeventh event: calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so that's normal. Calculator process is standard, so this seems okay.\n\nThen there are several svchost.exe entries with registry changes. Svchost is a normal process, but multiple registry changes might be a sign of something. However, svchost is known to host multiple services, so this could be normal.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe created a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file makes sense. The path is in the Downloads folder, which is common for software installation. Not suspicious.\n\nThen, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe set registry values. Both are standard processes, so this might be normal user activity.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe entries with registry changes and image loads. Chrome is a common browser, so loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll (which is part of Windows Defender) seems normal. Registry changes might be due to updates or extensions.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: most events are related to legitimate processes performing normal activities. There's no clear indication of malicious behavior. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and image loads might be part of normal operations. The only slightly odd thing is the winlogbeat file creation, but that's a legitimate action. No suspicious processes or unexpected file paths. The confidence here is low because there's no clear malicious activity detected. So, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve standard system processes (e.g., svchost.exe, chrome.exe, calc.exe) performing typical operations like loading legitimate system DLLs (clrjit.dll, urlmon.dll, amsi.dll) or modifying registry values. No suspicious process names, unexpected file paths, or anomalous behaviors detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this event. The process involved is winlogbeat.exe, which I know is a log shipper used for sending logs to Elasticsearch or other destinations. The event is about a file creation, specifically a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. \n\nFirst, the file path is in the user's Downloads folder, which is a common place for temporary files. The filename is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which might be a configuration file. But why is this interesting? Well, winlogbeat.exe is typically used for monitoring logs, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. However, the presence of a .new extension could indicate that the file is a temporary or newly created configuration that hasn't been finalized yet.\n\nBut wait, is there any indication of malicious activity here? The event alone doesn't show any suspicious behavior. The process is legitimate, and file creation in the Downloads folder isn't inherently bad. However, if this is the only event, maybe there's not enough context. But the user mentioned analyzing the entire batch as a whole. Since there's only one event here, I need to consider if this single event is enough to flag as interesting.\n\nHmm, maybe not. The creation of a configuration file by a legitimate process in a user directory is normal. Unless there are other events that show unusual activity, like multiple file creations, unexpected network connections, or privilege escalation, this single event doesn't seem suspicious. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear sign of malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.3 because it's a low probability, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. Justification is that it's a normal operation of winlogbeat creating a config file.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a temporary configuration file (.yml.new) in the user's Downloads directory, which is consistent with normal operation of the log shipping tool. No suspicious indicators present in this single event.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
