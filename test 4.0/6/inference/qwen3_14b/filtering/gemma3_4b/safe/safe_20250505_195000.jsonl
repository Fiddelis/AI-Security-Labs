{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: SDXHelper.exe is loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. Wait, those are legitimate system DLLs, but the fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading them repeatedly might be normal if it's a legitimate process. But then again, sometimes malware uses legitimate DLLs to avoid detection. However, just loading those DLLs isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler. That seems normal. Services.exe having a logon event, and a special logon from an unknown processâ€”maybe that's a red flag. But the process name is null here, which could be a placeholder or an error. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe. Multiple DNS queries might indicate communication with external servers, which could be normal or malicious. But without knowing the destination, it's hard to tell. However, if the same process is doing a lot of DNS queries, that's something to note.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for logging, so that's probably okay. The file path seems to be part of an installation or configuration, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nThe PowerShell events are interesting. PowerShell.exe is loading various .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are normal for PowerShell operations. However, there's also a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest...mdx.ps1. The name suggests it might be related to a script policy test, which could be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers use temporary files to execute malicious scripts. However, the filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which sounds like a test script, possibly benign.\n\nAnother thing to note is that SDXHelper.exe is involved in multiple ImageLoad events. If this process is not a known legitimate one, that could be a concern. But the name SDXHelper.exe isn't immediately recognizable as malware. However, the repetition of ImageLoad events might indicate something is trying to inject code or load additional modules.\n\nAlso, the registry value set events from svchost.exe and Explorer.EXE are normal, as those processes often modify the registry. The PowerShell process creating a file in Temp might be part of a normal operation, but if there's no other context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of activity from SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard Windows process. Multiple DNS queries and ImageLoad events could indicate network communication or module loading that's not typical. However, without more context like the destination IPs, the content of the files, or the presence of other suspicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. The PowerShell activity seems normal. The presence of a temporary script file might be benign, but it's worth checking. \n\nConsidering the confidence level, I think there are enough suspicious elements (repeated ImageLoad, DNS queries, unknown process SDXHelper.exe) to warrant further investigation, but not enough to be certain. So the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repetitive image load events for combase.dll and urlmon.dll by SDXHelper.exe (non-standard process name) combined with multiple DNS queries suggest potential malicious behavior. While some activity (e.g., PowerShell loading .NET DLLs) is normal, the pattern of repeated system DLL loads by an unusual process warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. The first event is a file delete in the Temp directory by PowerShell. That's a red flag because deleting temporary files isn't usually suspicious, but maybe if it's part of a larger pattern. Then there's a pipe created event, which might be normal, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are several entries about Provider Lifecycle events. Those are usually related to PowerShell's internal operations, so maybe just normal activity. However, there are a bunch of them, which might be a lot, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen, there's an image load of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably nothing wrong there. Another image load for urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows, so also normal.\n\nThen there's HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. Not sure about that executable. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but if it's not commonly known, that could be suspicious. However, the event just says a registry value was set, which could be part of normal operations or something more nefarious.\n\nThen, py.exe is created, which is the Python launcher. That's normal if someone is running Python scripts. The next events show Python processes being created and loading various DLLs. These are all legitimate parts of running Python, so that seems okay.\n\nBut wait, the first event was a file delete in the Temp directory. The filename is a PowerShell script that's been deleted. Maybe that script was used for something, but since it's deleted, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that it was deleted might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nAlso, the repeated Provider Lifecycle events might indicate some automated or scripted process. But without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple Image Load events for Python components seems normal if someone is running a Python application.\n\nPutting it all together: The only potentially suspicious event is the file delete in Temp, but that's common. The rest are normal system activities. However, the combination might not be enough to flag as interesting. Maybe the user is just running some scripts and cleaning up temp files. Without more anomalies, like unexpected network activity or unauthorized access, this might not be a security incident. So, I think it's NOT INTERESTING with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily show normal system activity, including PowerShell operations, Python process execution, and legitimate file\/image loading. No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are two entries about python.exe loading DLLs: _ctypes.pyd and libffi-8.dll. These are part of Python's standard libraries, so that's normal. No signs of malware here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating a file called .winlogbeat.yml.new in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is expected. But maybe the path is unusual? The user might be setting up the tool, which is normal.\n\nThen there are three Dns query events from SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper is part of the Windows Search service. DNS queries are common, but multiple queries might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe they're just searching for something.\n\nLastly, RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is involved in UAC and app permissions. Changing registry values could be normal, but if it's unexpected, it might be suspicious. However, the log doesn't show the specific registry key or value, so it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs don't show any clear signs of malicious activity. The events are either normal operations (Python DLLs, Winlogbeat config, SDXHelper DNS queries) or lack enough detail to be suspicious. The repetition of DNS queries might be worth noting, but without more info, it's not enough to classify as interesting. So, probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show standard system behavior (Python DLL loading, Winlogbeat config file creation, SDXHelper DNS queries, and RuntimeBroker registry updates). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
