{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first event: Explorer.EXE setting a registry value. That's normal, as Explorer often interacts with the registry. Then there's Chrome.exe creating a process, which is typical. There are multiple entries of Chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of them, but maybe that's just normal behavior for Chrome, like updating settings or extensions. \n\nWait, but there are several instances of Chrome.exe setting registry values. Let me count. There are about 10 entries of Chrome.exe with Registry value set. That's a lot. But is that suspicious? Maybe not on its own. However, I should check for other anomalies. \n\nNext, there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation. The command line includes -secured and -Embedding. That might be normal for WMI processes, but sometimes malicious actors use WMI for persistence. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThen there are svchost.exe processes with different parameters. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so seeing multiple instances is normal. The command lines here seem legitimate, like -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted. \n\nThe event with services.exe and a logon is normal. The special logon event might be related to a service starting. \n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is interesting. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a file in the Downloads directory could be part of its normal operation. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which might be a configuration file. That seems legitimate. \n\nLooking at the Image loaded event for Chrome.exe with taskschd.dll. Taskschd.dll is part of Task Scheduler. If Chrome is loading this DLL, that might be unexpected. But wait, Task Scheduler is a system component, and Chrome might not normally interact with it. However, if Chrome is using Task Scheduler for some automation, that could be legitimate. But maybe it's a sign of something else. \n\nAnother point is the Network connection detected events. Chrome making network connections is normal, but if there are multiple connections to unusual destinations, that could be a red flag. However, the data here doesn't specify the destination, so I can't tell. \n\nPutting it all together: There are a lot of Chrome-related events, especially registry modifications. However, without seeing specific malicious activity like connecting to known bad IPs, unusual file creations, or unexpected processes, it's hard to classify this as suspicious. The presence of WmiPrvSE and svchost are normal. The winlogbeat event seems legitimate. The ImageLoad of taskschd.dll might be worth noting, but without more context, it's not conclusive. \n\nOverall, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The high number of registry changes by Chrome could be due to normal operations, like updates or user settings. So, I'd say it's not interesting for investigation. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe confidence around 0.4-0.5. But since the user wants a classification, I'll go with NOT INTERESTING, as there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system and application behavior (e.g., Chrome.exe registry modifications, svchost.exe processes, WmiPrvSE.exe execution). No clear indicators of compromise, malicious activity, or anomalous patterns are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these two events to determine if they're interesting. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems like a normal configuration file for Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe the user is setting up or updating the configuration. The second event is chrome.exe setting a registry value. Chrome modifying the registry could be normal, like updating settings, but sometimes malicious software does that too.\n\nHmm, but are these events suspicious? The first one is a file creation in a common download folder. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, so that might be expected. The second event is registry modification by Chrome. Since Chrome is a legitimate application, changing its own registry settings might be normal. However, I should check if there are any red flags. The first event's file name has a .new extension, which might indicate a temporary file during configuration updates. The second event doesn't have any file path, just the registry value. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the entire batch is interesting. Both events are separate. The first is a file creation by a legitimate process, the second is registry change by another legitimate process. Without more context, like unusual behavior, multiple events, or other indicators, these might be normal activities. Maybe the user is just installing software or updating configurations. There's no obvious malicious activity here. So the classification might be NOT INTERESTING. But I need to be sure. The confidence should be around 0.3 or 0.4 because there's no clear malicious intent, but the events are not suspicious either.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Both events involve legitimate processes (winlogbeat.exe and chrome.exe) performing normal operations (file creation and registry modification). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present in the combined events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
