The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created, specifically by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files located in the Office SolutionPackages directory. There's a lot of repetition here, like the same file being created multiple times. That might be a red flag. Also, the names of the files have these long, seemingly random strings, which could indicate obfuscation or something malicious trying to hide.\n\nThen there are a couple of ImageLoad events for BitsProxy.dll by svchost.exe and chrome.exe. BitsProxy.dll is a legitimate Windows component, so that might not be suspicious on its own. But combined with the other events, maybe there's something else going on.\n\nWait, there's also a Security Group Management event, but that's not related to the other logs. Then there's an event from winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of normal operations. But the user might be concerned if there's unauthorized activity.\n\nNow, the main thing here is the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate application, but the high volume of JavaScript files in the Office directory is unusual. Office typically doesn't store JavaScript files there. That could be a sign of malware, like a downloader or something that's injecting malicious scripts.\n\nAnother point is the duplication of files. If the same file is created multiple times, maybe it's part of a process that's trying to overwrite or install something. Also, the names of the files are similar, which might suggest they're part of the same payload or different stages of an attack.\n\nI should also check if there are any other processes involved. The winlogbeat event is probably normal, but the main concern is the SDXHelper.exe activity. Since there's no obvious legitimate reason for that process to be creating so many JavaScript files in that location, this seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. The user might need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, maybe part of a third-party software, or if it's malware. Also, checking the hashes of those JavaScript files could help determine if they're malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a high volume of file creation events primarily associated with **SDXHelper.exe**, a process not typically associated with standard Windows operations. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - **Location**: All files are created in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory, which is unusual for JavaScript files (`.min.js`).\n   - **File Naming**: The filenames contain obfuscated, random strings (e.g., `min_0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305.js`), which is common in malware to evade detection.\n   - **Frequency**: Multiple identical files are created repeatedly (e.g., `min_2c2b799434ae025d394cb01b9328508a.js` appears twice).\n\n2. **Unusual Process Activity**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe**: Not a standard Windows process. Its presence and behavior (massive file creation in a non-standard directory) raise suspicion of potential malware or unauthorized activity.\n   - **Winlogbeat**: A legitimate log-shipper tool, but the file creation here (`data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) appears normal and unrelated to the suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Components**:\n   - **BitsProxy.dll**: Loaded by `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`, which is normal. No immediate threat here.\n   - **Security Group Management Event**: Isolated and unrelated to other logs; no actionable insight.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **High Suspicion**: The repeated, obfuscated file creation by **SDXHelper.exe** in an atypical directory strongly suggests potential malicious activity (e.g., malware dropper, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms).\n- **Need for Investigation**: \n  - Verify if **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate process (check digital signatures, file paths, and parent processes).\n  - Analyze the contents of the `.min.js` files (e.g., via hashing or sandboxing) to confirm if they contain malicious code.\n  - Monitor for lateral movement or further anomalous behavior.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThis activity warrants immediate investigation. If **SDXHelper.exe** is confirmed to be malicious, system isolation, malware removal, and network traffic analysis are necessary to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there's a bunch of events here, mostly about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like random hashes. There are multiple entries for the same file being created, some even duplicated. Then there are a couple of registry events from chrome.exe.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software related to Microsoft Office? But creating so many JS files in the OfflineFiles folder... That seems unusual. Typically, OfflineFiles might be used for caching, but generating so many unique files with hash names could be a sign of something malicious, like downloading payloads or generating obfuscated code.\n\nAlso, the fact that some files are created multiple times might indicate that the process is either malfunctioning or intentionally creating duplicates. The registry events from chrome.exe might be unrelated, but it's worth noting if there's any connection between the registry changes and the file creations. However, without more context on what registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the naming convention of the files. The use of hashes could be an attempt to avoid detection, as malware often uses such techniques. But I should check if there's any known legitimate software that does this. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, maybe it's part of an update or some kind of package manager, but the sheer number of files seems excessive.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the user has a custom application that uses SDXHelper.exe and generates these files as part of its normal operations. However, without more information, it's safer to lean towards the suspicious side.\n\nIn summary, the key red flags here are the high volume of file creations by an unknown or uncommon process (SDXHelper.exe), the use of obfuscated file names, and the duplication of files. These could indicate malicious activity, such as downloading and storing payloads locally. The registry events from chrome.exe might be unrelated, but they could also be part of a broader attack vector. Further investigation would be needed, such as checking the process's digital signatures, analyzing the files' contents, and reviewing system behavior for other anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate a potential security concern due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **High Volume of File Creations by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **16+ JavaScript files** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) are created in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceeb...`.\n   - **Duplicate files** (e.g., `min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js` appears twice) suggest either redundancy or intentional duplication.\n\n2. **Obfuscated File Names:**\n   - Filenames use **hash-like strings** (e.g., `min_5a5d966fb4bee84e88c268af3293257d.js`), which is common in **malware** to evade detection.\n\n3. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a widely recognized legitimate process. If it is associated with a third-party application, its behavior (mass file creation in system directories) is **highly atypical**.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`:**\n   - While not directly linked to the files, **registry changes** by Chrome could indicate **tampering** or **malicious configuration** (e.g., injecting malicious extensions or modifying startup settings).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Activity:** The behavior resembles **downloaders** or **payload storers** (e.g., storing obfuscated JavaScript for later execution).\n- **Persistence Mechanism:** Creating files in `SolutionPackages` (a directory used by Microsoft Office for updates) could be an attempt to **hide malicious code** within legitimate processes.\n- **Lateral Movement:** The registry changes by Chrome might be part of a broader attack, such as **installing malicious extensions** or **modifying browser settings**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Isolate the System:**\n   - If this is a production system, isolate it immediately to prevent potential lateral movement.\n\n2. **Analyze `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check its **digital signature** (if any) and **file hash** (e.g., via VirusTotal or malware analysis platforms).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** to trace its parent process and loaded modules.\n\n3. **Inspect the JavaScript Files:**\n   - Analyze the contents of the `.js` files for **obfuscated code**, **malicious URLs**, or **exploit patterns** (e.g., using tools like `Strings` or online deobfuscators).\n\n4. **Audit Chrome Registry Changes:**\n   - Review the **registry keys** modified by Chrome (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Chrome`) for **unauthorized extensions**, **startup URLs**, or **tampered settings**.\n\n5. **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - Search for **network connections** to suspicious IPs\/domains.\n   - Look for **unusual scheduled tasks**, **service creations**, or **hidden processes**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe behavior observed is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. While not definitive proof of compromise, the combination of obfuscated file names, mass file creation, and registry modifications strongly suggests **malicious activity**. Further analysis is required to confirm the threat and scope."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office package resources. All the files have similar names, starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash and .js extension. The question is probably about whether this is normal or if it's a security issue.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. Maybe it's part of a software that's legitimate, like a Microsoft product or a third-party application. The file names suggest they're minified JavaScript files, which are common in web development. But why are they being created in the Office package resources?\n\nWait, the path is \"AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\". That's a common location for temporary files or caches. Maybe these files are part of a caching mechanism or some kind of update process. However, creating multiple files with unique hashes might indicate that they're being generated dynamically, which could be normal or could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Let me think. Microsoft doesn't have an SDXHelper.exe by default. Maybe it's part of a third-party app like an office add-in, a plugin, or some kind of software that interacts with Office. Alternatively, it could be malware. Malware often creates temporary files in such directories.\n\nAnother point: the repeated creation of the same file names. Some entries have duplicates, like \"min_6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05.js\" appearing twice. That might be normal if the process is creating them multiple times, but if it's a malicious process, it might be trying to inject code or persist itself.\n\nI should also consider the hashes. The hash part of the filename could be a checksum or a unique identifier. If these files are part of a legitimate process, they might be generated each time with different hashes based on content. However, if the hashes are random or not following a pattern, that might be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: checking if the user has any Office add-ins or recently installed software that might be using SDXHelper.exe. If the user isn't aware of such software, that's a red flag.\n\nI should also think about system behavior. If the user is seeing high CPU or disk usage from SDXHelper.exe, that could indicate a problem. But the logs provided don't mention performance issues, just the file creation.\n\nIn summary, the key points to consider are: the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, the purpose of the files being created, the presence of duplicates, and the hashes. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the combination of a non-standard process creating multiple files in a system directory could be suspicious. The user should check for the process in Task Manager, look up its reputation, and run a malware scan.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate that the process `SDXHelper.exe` is creating multiple minified JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory. Here's a breakdown of the situation and potential concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Identity**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Microsoft process. It may belong to a third-party application, an Office add-in, or potentially malicious software.\n   - Verify the process in **Task Manager** or **Process Explorer** to confirm its origin (e.g., publisher, file location).\n\n2. **File Behavior**:\n   - The files are **minified JavaScript** (`.min.js`), which is common in web development but unusual for local system directories.\n   - **Duplicate filenames** (e.g., `min_6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05.js` appearing twice) suggest repeated creation, which could indicate caching, updates, or abnormal activity.\n\n3. **Directory Location**:\n   - The files are being written to `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`, a directory often used by Office for temporary files or caches. However, this is not a typical location for JavaScript files.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n1. **Legitimate Use**:\n   - If **SDXHelper.exe** is part of a **legitimate application** (e.g., an Office add-in, productivity tool, or software updater), the files might be cached or generated dynamically for runtime use.\n   - However, this is **uncommon** for such a process to create JavaScript files in this directory.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity**:\n   - **Malware** often creates arbitrary files in system directories to persist or execute code. The use of `.min.js` files could be an attempt to disguise malicious scripts as legitimate resources.\n   - The repetitive creation of files with unique hashes might indicate **data exfiltration**, **script injection**, or **malware persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Process**:\n   - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe` in Task Manager. If it’s in a suspicious location (e.g., `AppData`, `Temp`, or user directories), this raises a red flag.\n   - Use **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **VirusTotal** to scan the file and check its reputation.\n\n2. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Look for **unusual network activity**, high CPU\/disk usage, or unexpected behavior from `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** (ProcMon) to trace file operations and network requests.\n\n3. **Remove Suspicious Software**:\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is not associated with any known application, consider **uninstalling** it via **Control Panel** or **Add\/Remove Programs**.\n\n4. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with a trusted antivirus tool.\n   - Use **Windows Defender Offline** to detect deeply embedded malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the files themselves are not inherently malicious, the **unusual behavior** of `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files in a system directory warrants further investigation. If the process is untrusted or unexplained, it is **likely malicious** and should be removed immediately. Always ensure your system is up to date with the latest security patches."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office package resources directory. The files all have names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a bunch of hexadecimal characters and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the setup and installation processes. It might be involved in deploying updates or configurations. But why is it creating so many JavaScript files in the Office resources folder?\n\nLooking at the file names, they all seem to be minified JavaScript files. Minified files are typically optimized for production, but having so many of them in a specific directory might be unusual. The repetition of some files, like the one with \"a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js\" appearing twice, could indicate a possible error in the process, maybe a duplicate creation or a loop.\n\nNow, considering the directory path: \"AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Setup\\Package\\Resources\". This is a known directory for Office installation and update files. However, the presence of numerous JavaScript files here might not be standard. Normally, this folder might contain XML or other configuration files, but JavaScript files could be part of a new feature or a script-based update.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether these files are legitimate. If SDXHelper is a legitimate process, then these files might be part of a normal update. But if there's any suspicion about the process, like if it's not the genuine Microsoft Office SDXHelper, that could be a red flag. However, the user hasn't mentioned any malware indicators here.\n\nThe fact that there are 16 entries, all from the same process and same directory, might be normal during an installation or update. However, the high number of files and their names could be part of a specific update package. But I should also consider if this is a false positive or a normal operation.\n\nI should also think about possible threats. If these files were created by a malicious process impersonating SDXHelper, that could be a problem. But without additional information like process hashes, parent processes, or network activity, it's hard to tell. The user hasn't provided that context.\n\nIn summary, while the creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper in the Office resources directory is unusual, it might be part of a legitimate update or configuration process. However, the high number of files and their repetition could warrant further investigation, such as checking the integrity of the files, verifying the process's authenticity, and monitoring for any unusual behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process (associated with Microsoft Office setup\/updates) is creating multiple minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the Office installation directory. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and Location:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (part of Microsoft Office installation\/update mechanisms).\n   - **Directory:** `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Setup\\Package\\Resources` (a known path for Office setup files).\n\n2. **File Characteristics:**\n   - All files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hex>.js` (suggesting minified JavaScript).\n   - Some files are duplicated (e.g., `a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js` appears twice).\n\n3. **Behavior:**\n   - High volume of file creation (16 entries) in a short time frame.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations:**\n1. **Legitimate Office Update\/Configuration:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is known to handle Office deployment and updates. The JavaScript files might be part of a new feature, localization, or script-based configuration during an update.\n   - The repetition of files could be due to a redundant operation (e.g., a failed attempt to overwrite a file).\n\n2. **Unusual Behavior (Potential Red Flags):**\n   - **Uncommon File Types:** JavaScript files in the Office setup directory are not typical. This might indicate a non-standard update or a misconfigured process.\n   - **Duplicates:** Repeated creation of the same file may suggest a loop or error in the update process.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Verify Process Authenticity:**\n  - Ensure `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft-signed process (check digital signatures in Task Manager or via `sigcheck`).\n  - Confirm no malicious processes are masquerading as `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n- **Check for Malware:**\n  - Scan the files with antivirus software (e.g., Windows Defender) to rule out malware.\n  - Use tools like **Malwarebytes** or **VirusTotal** for file analysis.\n\n- **Monitor System Behavior:**\n  - Check for unusual network activity, high CPU\/memory usage, or unexpected Office behavior during the update.\n\n- **Review Office Logs:**\n  - Examine Office setup logs (`%temp%\\OfficeSetupLogs`) for errors or warnings related to the update.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the activity could be part of a legitimate Office update, the creation of numerous JavaScript files in a non-standard location warrants further investigation. Ensure the process is genuine, scan for malware, and monitor for anomalies. If the behavior persists or is accompanied by other suspicious signs, consider rolling back the update or contacting Microsoft Support."}

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. There are multiple entries for the same files, which might indicate that they were created multiple times, but maybe it's just repeated events or maybe some duplication in the logs.\n\nThen there are some events related to chrome.exe. One is a registry value set, and another is image loaded from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender components, so loading those DLLs is normal. The registry events for chrome.exe might be part of normal operations, but I need to check if they're suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, the main thing here is the SDXHelper.exe creating all those JavaScript files. SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Software Development Kit (SDK) or some extension. However, creating a lot of JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory might be unusual. Normally, Office might not generate such files there. But maybe it's part of some update or installation process. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. It might indicate that the process is being used to inject malicious code, or perhaps it's a benign process that's just being logged multiple times.\n\nAnother angle: the files are minified JavaScript, which is common in web applications, but in an Office context, that's less typical. If these files are being created in a user's local directory, maybe they're part of a user-installed add-in or something. But if they're being created without user interaction, that's suspicious.\n\nAlso, the presence of chrome.exe interacting with the registry and loading Defender DLLs is normal, but the key here is whether there's any correlation between the SDXHelper activities and the chrome.exe events. If they're unrelated, then maybe not. But if there's a connection, like the files being used in some way by Chrome, that could be a concern.\n\nHowever, the logs don't show any clear signs of malicious activity. The SDXHelper is a legitimate process, and creating files in the Office directory might be part of its normal operations. The repetition of the same file creations might just be redundant logs. Without additional indicators like unexpected network activity, process injections, or unauthorized access, it's hard to label this as suspicious.\n\nBut the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation. Since there's a high volume of file creation events by SDXHelper, which is not typically known for creating many JS files in that location, it might warrant further investigation. Maybe the system administrator should check if there are any unexpected processes or if these files are part of a legitimate update. Alternatively, it could be a false positive if the logs are just capturing normal operations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the events aren't overtly malicious, the unusual file creation patterns by SDXHelper could be worth looking into, especially if there's no known legitimate reason for those files. Therefore, this batch might be considered interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presented includes a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially unusual behavior** that may warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity**\n- **Volume and Pattern**: \n  - **14+ events** of files being created by `SDXHelper.exe` in the directory:  \n    `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`  \n    These files are minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js`) with unique hash-based filenames.\n  - **Repetition**: Some files (e.g., `min_e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182.js`) are logged multiple times, possibly due to redundant logging or repeated creation events.\n\n- **Context and Concerns**:\n  - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft Office component (part of the **Office Software Development Kit** or extension tools). However, **creating numerous JavaScript files in the `SolutionPackages` directory** is **not typical** for this process.\n  - **Minified JS files** are common in web applications but are unusual in an Office context. This could indicate:\n    - **Legitimate add-ins or extensions** (if properly authorized).\n    - **Malicious activity** (e.g., injection of malicious scripts or data exfiltration via JS files).\n  - The **high frequency** of file creation events may suggest **abnormal behavior** or **log redundancy**, requiring correlation with other system logs (e.g., network activity, process trees).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Chrome.exe Activity**\n- **Registry Modifications**:\n  - Two events show `chrome.exe` setting registry values (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\VolumeCaching`). These are **normal operations** for Chrome during startup or configuration changes.\n- **Image Loads**:\n  - `chrome.exe` loads **Windows Defender DLLs** (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`). This is **expected** as Chrome interacts with Windows Defender for real-time protection.\n  - No signs of suspicious DLLs or unexpected paths.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Indicators of Concern**\n- **Unusual File Creation by SDXHelper**:\n  - The **creation of JS files in the `SolutionPackages` directory** by a process not typically associated with web content (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe`) is **uncommon** and may indicate:\n    - **Malicious use of SDXHelper** (e.g., as a dropper or loader for malicious payloads).\n    - **Misconfigured Office add-ins** or **third-party tools** interacting unexpectedly with Office.\n- **Lack of Context**:\n  - No additional logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree, user interaction) are provided to confirm whether the file creation is **benign** or **malicious**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network activity** from `SDXHelper.exe` or the created JS files (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious domains).\n   - Examine **process tree logs** to see if `SDXHelper.exe` is spawned by unexpected parent processes.\n2. **Analyze the JS Files**:\n   - Inspect the contents of the created files (if accessible) to determine if they contain **malicious code** (e.g., obfuscated scripts, exfiltration logic).\n3. **Check for Office Add-ins**:\n   - Verify if any **unauthorized Office add-ins** are installed or configured on the system.\n4. **Monitor SDXHelper.exe Behavior**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals Suite** to trace file operations and registry access by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the **Chrome.exe activity** appears legitimate, the **repeated creation of JS files by SDXHelper.exe** in an unusual directory raises **sufficient concern** to warrant further investigation. This could either be:\n- A **benign anomaly** (e.g., a misconfigured tool or logging issue), or  \n- **Malicious activity** (e.g., exploitation of SDXHelper for persistence or data exfiltration).\n\n**Action**: Investigate the file creation events, analyze the contents of the JS files, and cross-reference with other system logs to rule out malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's SDXHelper.exe and chrome.exe, along with EXCEL.EXE. The SDXHelper.exe is creating several JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. That seems a bit odd because those files are in a specific Office folder, and the names suggest they might be related to some Office add-in or copilot feature. But why so many different hashes? Maybe they're being generated dynamically or injected somehow.\n\nThen, chrome.exe is creating a file named Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx and also creating a Zone.Identifier stream, which is common when files are downloaded from the internet. But there are multiple entries for File stream created for that same Excel file. That might be normal, but the repetition could be a red flag. Also, chrome.exe is loading urlmon.dll, which is a Windows component for URL handling, but that's a standard library, so maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nEXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, and others. Those are part of the .NET framework and Windows Defender. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but the fact that EXCEL.EXE is loading it could be part of a legitimate process or maybe an indicator of something else. Also, there's a file created named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx, which is a temporary file created by Excel when the document is opened, so that's probably normal.\n\nBut the main thing here is the SDXHelper.exe creating those JavaScript files. The Office SolutionPackages directory is usually for Office add-ins, but the filenames with the hashes might be part of a malicious payload. The repetition of the same process creating multiple files with similar names but different hashes could indicate that the files are being generated as part of a larger attack, maybe a downloader or some malicious script. Also, the fact that these files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be a way to store malicious code that's executed later.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other suspicious activities. The chrome.exe events seem to be related to normal file operations. The EXCEL.EXE loading DLLs is part of standard operations. The User Account Management event is just a system event, so not relevant here.\n\nBut the key point is the SDXHelper.exe activity. If that process is legitimate, then it's okay, but if it's a malicious process, then those files could be part of a malware distribution. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the presence of multiple JavaScript files in a non-standard location, especially with hashes in the filenames, is suspicious. It's possible that these files are being used to execute malicious code through some exploit in Office or the add-in.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the events involving SDXHelper.exe creating those files are the most suspicious. Even though there's no direct evidence of malware here, the unusual file creation patterns and the location of the files could warrant further investigation. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting and should be looked into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Multiple JavaScript files** (`officeaicopilot-strings.min*.js`) are created in the `Office\\SolutionPackages\\OfflineFiles` directory with unique hashes in their filenames. \n   - **Context:** This directory is typically used for **Office add-ins or templates**, but the repetitive creation of files with hash-like names suggests **dynamic generation** (e.g., payloads, scripts, or obfuscated code). This could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., a downloader, exploit, or injection of malicious scripts).\n\n2. **Unusual File Naming and Location:**\n   - The files are stored in `OfflineFiles`, which is not a standard location for user-generated content. This could be an attempt to **hide or persist malicious code** in a less-monitored directory.\n\n3. **Correlation with `EXCEL.EXE`:**\n   - `EXCEL.EXE` is loading **legitimate system DLLs** (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, `urlmon.dll`), but the presence of a **temporary file** (`~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) suggests the Excel file was opened. If the Excel file is malicious, this could be a **chain of exploitation** (e.g., a macro or embedded object triggering the `SDXHelper.exe` activity).\n\n4. **`chrome.exe` Activity:**\n   - While creating a file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) and its `Zone.Identifier` stream is normal for downloaded files, the **repeated \"File stream created\" events** for the same file could indicate **unnecessary or abnormal operations** (e.g., tampering or injection).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- The **combination of unusual file creation** (JavaScript files in non-standard locations) and **correlation with Excel\/Chrome** raises concerns about **potential malware distribution** or **exploitation** (e.g., a malicious Excel file triggering a payload via `SDXHelper.exe`).\n- The **hash-like filenames** and repetitive creation suggest **dynamic generation of content**, which is often seen in **malware or data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Analyze the `SDXHelper.exe` process:**\n   - Check its **parent process**, **command-line arguments**, and **network activity** (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Procmon** to inspect file operations and registry changes.\n\n2. **Inspect the Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`):**\n   - Check for **macros**, **embedded objects**, or **suspicious content** (e.g., obfuscated VBA code).\n   - Use **VirusTotal** or **sandbox analysis** to scan the file.\n\n3. **Check for persistence mechanisms:**\n   - Look for **scheduled tasks**, **registry keys**, or **startup entries** related to `SDXHelper.exe` or the JavaScript files.\n\n4. **Monitor network traffic:**\n   - Investigate if the JavaScript files communicate with external IPs or domains (e.g., C2 servers).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **interesting and potentially malicious** due to the **unusual file creation patterns** and **correlation with Excel\/Chrome activity**. Further investigation is required to confirm if this is a **false positive, legitimate software behavior, or a security incident**."}

The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first event: Excel.exe deleting a file named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename suggest it's a temporary or auto-save file from Excel. That's normal, maybe part of editing a document. Not too concerning yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate system process, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be a red flag. However, the logs don't show any specific malicious activity here. They just mention registry values being set, which can be normal for system operations.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, so creating files there might be part of normal operations, like updates or add-ins. But the filenames are JavaScript files, which could be benign or potentially malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same file is created twice, which might be redundant, but not necessarily bad.\n\nThen, Excel.exe is creating a file stream in a temporary directory, which is common when working with files. The Zone.Identifier stream is also normal, as Windows uses that to track where a file came from (like internet downloads). The image loaded events for coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL are legitimate system files, so that's expected.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal. The .new extension suggests it's a temporary file during configuration updates. Not suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the repeated registry value set events by Excel.exe. Multiple entries of the same process and task. While frequent registry changes could be a sign of something, Excel does interact with the registry for various functions. Without seeing specific keys or values changed, it's hard to determine if this is malicious.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a mix of normal activities related to Excel and Office processes, some file creations and deletions that are typical, and registry changes that are part of normal operations. No obvious signs of malware, like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or access to sensitive areas. The SDXHelper and Excel activities don't seem to point to malicious intent. The only thing that stands out is the repeated registry events, but without more context, they might just be part of the application's normal behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's no clear indication of a security threat. The events are consistent with normal user activities and legitimate system processes. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's additional context or other indicators of compromise that aren't visible here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate a clear security threat or malicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Excel-Related Activity:**\n   - **File Deletion:** The deletion of `~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` (a temporary auto-save file) is normal during Excel document editing.\n   - **File Creation:** The creation of `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx.LNK` (a shortcut file) and the `Zone.Identifier` stream are standard Windows behaviors for tracking file origins and temporary operations.\n   - **Registry Changes:** Multiple `Registry value set` events by `EXCEL.EXE` are likely related to application state management or document metadata. While frequent registry activity can sometimes indicate issues, no suspicious keys or values are explicitly mentioned here.\n\n2. **svchost.exe and SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - **svchost.exe:** Setting registry values is a normal function of this system process, which hosts various Windows services.\n   - **SDXHelper.exe:** Creating JavaScript files in the `Office SolutionPackages` directory appears benign, as these files could be part of legitimate Office add-ins or updates.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat.exe:**\n   - The creation of a `.yml.new` configuration file is consistent with normal operations of a log-shipping tool during configuration updates.\n\n### **No Red Flags:**\n- No unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or access to sensitive areas (e.g., system directories, user credentials).\n- No evidence of malware (e.g., unknown executables, network connections, or anomalous data transfers).\n- The repeated `Registry value set` events by `EXCEL.EXE` are not inherently suspicious without additional context (e.g., specific registry keys modified).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are consistent with normal user activity and legitimate system processes. **This batch is not interesting for investigation** unless further context (e.g., correlation with other logs, user behavior anomalies, or external threat intelligence) suggests otherwise."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants to know if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about Excel.EXE performing registry value sets. There are a bunch of those, like 9 entries. Then there are some entries with process null and task None. But then there are also entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. \n\nHmm, Excel.EXE modifying the registry could be normal, but if it's doing it multiple times, maybe that's suspicious. However, the more concerning part is the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in those SolutionPackages directories. Those paths look like they might be related to Office add-ins or solutions. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, especially for add-ins. But creating so many files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be part of normal operations. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times (like the taskpane_e0bdd6...js file being created twice) might be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple different JavaScript files could indicate that an add-in is being deployed or updated. \n\nBut is that malicious? Not necessarily. However, the combination of Excel.EXE modifying the registry and SDXHelper.exe creating numerous files might be part of a legitimate process. But sometimes, attackers use registry changes to persist or modify behavior, and creating files in those directories could be part of injecting malicious code. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, even if some of these are normal, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and the creation of multiple files by SDXHelper might warrant further investigation. Especially since the files are JavaScript, which can be used for scripting and potentially malicious activities if they're not from trusted sources. \n\nBut I need to check if the files are part of known legitimate Office add-ins. Since the user hasn't provided more context, it's safer to consider that this could be suspicious. The high number of events and the specific paths might indicate something unusual. So, the answer would be that this is interesting for investigation because of the combination of registry changes by Excel and the multiple file creations by SDXHelper in directories associated with Office solutions, which could be indicative of either legitimate operations or potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events warrants further investigation due to the following indicators:\n\n### **1. Unusual Activity by `Excel.EXE`:**\n- **Repeated Registry Modifications:**  \n  `Excel.EXE` is performing multiple `Registry Value Set` operations. While Excel can legitimately modify the registry (e.g., for add-ins or settings), repeated changes may indicate tampering, persistence mechanisms, or unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n### **2. Suspicious File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n- **High Volume of JavaScript Files in Office Directories:**  \n  `SDXHelper.exe` (associated with Microsoft Office add-ins) is creating numerous JavaScript files (`*.js`) in paths like:  \n  ```\n  C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\<UUID>\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n  ```  \n  These files are often used by Office add-ins, but the **repetition** of identical files (e.g., `taskpane_e0bdd6...js` created twice) and the **large number** of files (e.g., 10+ unique `.js` files) raises concerns. Malicious add-ins or malware could exploit these directories to inject scripts or persist.\n\n### **3. Contextual Red Flags:**\n- **Unusual File Names and Paths:**  \n  The use of UUID-like folder names (`f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2`, `36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b`) in the `SolutionPackages` directory is typical for Office add-ins but could also be used by attackers to obfuscate malicious payloads.\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimacy:**  \n  While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process, the **volume and pattern** of file creation (especially in `OfflineFiles`) may indicate either:\n  - **Legitimate deployment** of a new or updated add-in.\n  - **Malicious activity**, such as injecting scripts or leveraging Office for code execution.\n\n### **4. Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Persistence:**  \n  Registry changes by `Excel.EXE` could be part of a persistence mechanism (e.g., adding startup entries or modifying existing keys).\n- **Add-in Exploitation:**  \n  The JavaScript files might be used to execute malicious code via Office (e.g., through embedded scripts or macro triggers).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the Source of the Add-in:**  \n  Check if the files in `SolutionPackages` are associated with a known, trusted add-in. If not, this could indicate a malicious add-in.\n- **Analyze Registry Changes:**  \n  Review the specific registry keys modified by `Excel.EXE` to determine if they are related to legitimate Office operations or unauthorized changes.\n- **Monitor for Further Activity:**  \n  Watch for additional suspicious behavior, such as network connections to unknown domains or unexpected process interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThis activity is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of **unusual registry modifications by Excel** and **high-volume, potentially suspicious file creation by SDXHelper.exe**. While some behaviors may be legitimate, the pattern and context suggest the need for deeper analysis to rule out malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like da-dk-ui-strings-json, de-de-ui-strings-json, etc. \n\nHmm, first thought: are these normal files that Office might generate? Maybe during an update or installation? The process is SDXHelper.exe, which I think is related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of the setup or update process. The filenames suggest they're language-specific UI resources. \n\nBut wait, why so many files being created in a short time? The same process creating multiple files in the same directory. Also, there's a duplicate entry for eu-es-ui-strings-json. Is that a problem? Maybe not, but it's worth noting.\n\nNow, considering security. If this is a legitimate process, then it's normal. But if SDXHelper.exe isn't a known Office component, that could be a red flag. However, I recall that SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office setup, so maybe it's okay. \n\nAnother angle: the directory path is AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That seems like a legitimate place for Office to store temporary or package files. The filenames are consistent with resource files for different languages, which makes sense if Office is being localized or updated.\n\nBut why are there so many different language files? Maybe the user has multiple language packs installed, or the system is downloading them. Alternatively, it could be part of a malicious activity where the files are actually malware disguised as legitimate resources. However, without more info like hashes or file contents, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the user hasn't mentioned any other symptoms like high CPU usage, network activity, or pop-ups. So assuming the logs are the only data, the most plausible explanation is that Office is installing or updating, and SDXHelper.exe is creating these UI resource files for different languages. The repetition of some files might be a harmless duplication, or maybe a logging error.\n\nIn conclusion, unless there's additional context indicating malicious behavior, this seems like a normal process. But since the task is to determine if it's suspicious, I should mention that while the activity is consistent with legitimate Office operations, further checks (like verifying the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe, checking for unexpected network activity, or analyzing the files) would be necessary to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that **SDXHelper.exe** (likely associated with Microsoft Office) is creating multiple language-specific UI resource files (e.g., `da-dk-ui-strings-json`, `de-de-ui-strings-json`, etc.) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Location**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft Office component, often involved in setup, updates, or localization tasks.\n   - The directory path (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`) is consistent with temporary or package storage for Office applications.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Files are named with language codes (e.g., `da-dk`, `fr-ca`) and suffixes like `-ui-strings-json`, suggesting they are **language-specific UI resources**.\n   - This aligns with Office's need to support multilingual interfaces or updates.\n\n3. **Duplicates**:\n   - The file `eu-es-ui-strings-json_a2e18453e21d34b5fedf0f74fed2ebd7.js` appears **twice**. This could be a benign logging artifact or a minor duplication error, but it’s worth verifying if it’s intentional.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Suspicious?**\n- **Likely Legitimate**:\n  - The activity matches **normal Office behavior** during updates, installations, or localization.\n  - The process and directory are consistent with Microsoft's known operations.\n\n- **Potential Red Flags (if applicable)**:\n  - **No additional context** (e.g., high CPU\/network usage, unexpected processes, or user-reported issues) is provided.\n  - If **SDXHelper.exe** were not a signed Microsoft binary, or if the files had unusual hashes\/contents, this could raise concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Verify Authenticity**:\n  - Confirm that **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft-signed process (check properties or use tools like [Process Explorer](https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/downloads\/process-explorer)).\n- **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n  - If this activity occurs **unexpectedly** (e.g., without user-initiated Office updates), investigate further.\n  - Check for **unusual file contents** (e.g., via hash analysis or sandboxing) if the files are not expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**No immediate suspicion**. The logs align with **legitimate Office operations**, but further verification of the process and files is recommended if the context is unclear or if other suspicious activity is observed."}

The user wants me to analyze the batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are in paths related to Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, specifically under PackageResources\/OfflineFiles. The filenames look like they're UI strings in various languages, like gu-in, hr-hr, hu-hu, etc. There's also a fabric.js and some icon files. These might be part of a legitimate Office update or installation, as those directories are commonly used for Office packages.\n\nHowever, I notice that SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of these files. While SDXHelper is a known process related to Microsoft Office, the sheer number of files being created might be unusual. Also, there are duplicate entries for some files, like the hu-hu and id-id UI strings. Duplicates could indicate an issue, maybe a failed installation or a malicious attempt to flood the system with files.\n\nThen there are some registry events from svchost.exe and EXCEL.EXE. Registry changes can be normal, but combined with the file creation, it might be worth checking. However, svchost.exe is a common system process, and the registry events here are generic. They might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the presence of a process with name null and task None. That might be an error or an incomplete log entry. It's not clear what that represents, but it's worth noting as it could be an anomaly.\n\nPutting this together, the main points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in Office directories, possible duplicates, and some registry changes. While some of this could be normal, the volume and the presence of duplicates might indicate a problem. However, without more context or signs of malicious activity (like unusual processes, network connections, or unexpected registry changes), it's hard to say definitively. The logs don't show clear signs of malware, but the unusual activity is enough to warrant further investigation to rule out anything malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Volume:** Over 20 files are created by `SDXHelper.exe` in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory, primarily under `PackageResources\/OfflineFiles`. These files appear to be language-specific UI string resources (e.g., `gu-in-ui-strings-json`, `id-id-ui-strings-json`) and static assets like `fabric.js`.\n   - **Legitimacy:** `SDXHelper.exe` is a known Microsoft Office process associated with installation\/repair operations. The file paths and naming conventions align with legitimate Office updates or add-ins.\n   - **Duplicates:** Some files (e.g., `hu-hu-ui-strings-json`, `id-id-ui-strings-json`) are logged twice. While this could indicate a benign retry or logging artifact, it may also hint at an incomplete or forced installation.\n\n2. **Registry Events:**\n   - **svchost.exe and EXCEL.EXE:** Multiple registry events (value set, object added\/deleted) are logged. These are common during system updates or configuration changes but lack context (e.g., specific keys\/paths) to confirm legitimacy.\n   - **No Clear Malicious Indicators:** No suspicious registry modifications (e.g., persistence mechanisms, unauthorized key changes) are explicitly visible.\n\n3. **Anomalies:**\n   - **Null Process Entries:** Two log entries have `process: null` and `task: None`, which may indicate incomplete or corrupted logs. This could obscure critical details if these entries are part of a larger pattern.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likely Benign:** The activity aligns with typical Office installation\/repair processes, especially if the system is undergoing updates or add-in deployments.\n- **Potential Concerns:**\n  - The **high volume** of file creations and duplicates could signal an unusual workload (e.g., a forced reinstall, malware mimicking legitimate processes, or a misconfigured application).\n  - **Lack of context** (e.g., timestamps, user context, associated network activity) limits definitive conclusions.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with System Context:**\n   - Check if the system is undergoing an Office update, repair, or add-in installation.\n   - Investigate timestamps to determine if the activity is clustered (e.g., during a scheduled task or user action).\n\n2. **Monitor for Additional Indicators:**\n   - Look for unusual network traffic, unexpected process behavior, or changes to sensitive registry keys (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office`).\n   - Verify the integrity of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., via antivirus, hash verification).\n\n3. **Review Log Completeness:**\n   - Investigate the `process: null` entries to ensure no critical data is missing.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **do not definitively indicate malicious activity**, but the **high volume of file creations and duplicates** warrant further investigation to rule out anomalies. If the system is stable and no other suspicious activity is observed, this may be a benign process. However, in a security-focused environment, deeper analysis (e.g., process monitoring, network inspection) is recommended. \n\n**Verdict:** **Low risk but requires contextual validation.**"}

Maybe it's related to some add-in or macro? But then, the files created by SDXHelper.exe are in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That's where Office solutions and add-ins are stored.
