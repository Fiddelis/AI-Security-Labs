{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of events. The user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. First, I need to look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. One event has a command line that creates a new PSDrive with the path \\\\Target\\\\C$. That seems like it's trying to map a network share, maybe to access files on another machine. That could be part of lateral movement in a network attack.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs related to .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and others. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell, but the repetition might be significant. However, I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1) in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Then immediately after, a FileDelete event for the same file. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of executing a script and then cleaning up, which is common in attacks to avoid leaving evidence. But since it's a temporary file, maybe it's just part of a normal process. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to testing script policies, but I'm not sure if that's benign or malicious.\n\nAnother FileCreate event is for a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. If this is part of a legitimate setup, it's okay, but if it's being used to inject malicious code, that's a problem.\n\nThere are also multiple ProcessCreate events for whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. But if it's being called repeatedly or in an unusual context, that might be suspicious. However, in this case, the command lines look normal.\n\nThe Registry value set event might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together, the suspicious elements are the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, the use of PowerShell to map a network drive, and the loading of multiple .NET DLLs. However, some of these actions could be part of normal PowerShell operations. The key is whether these events are part of a larger pattern. Since the temporary script is created and then deleted, it might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. The network drive mapping could be part of accessing another system, which is a red flag. The combination of these events, especially the temporary script and network access, suggests potential malicious activity. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. I'd lean towards INTERESTING with a moderate confidence because the actions could be part of an attack, but there's not enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious actions like creating\/deleting temporary scripts, mapping network drives (\\\\Target\\\\C$), and loading .NET DLLs, which may indicate lateral movement or script-based attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool, but sometimes it's used in malicious activities. Let me check the specific events.\n\nLooking at the first entry: Image loaded for System.Management.Automation.ni.dll. That's part of PowerShell's normal operation, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. PowerShell scripts in Temp could be a red flag, especially if they're being created and then deleted. Wait, there's a File Delete logged event for the same file. That might be part of a script that's being executed temporarily, which is common in legitimate scenarios, but sometimes attackers do that to hide their tracks.\n\nAnother event is a Pipe Created. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but if there's a lot of them or unusual activity, it could be a sign of something. However, in this case, there's only one mention of a pipe, so maybe not too concerning.\n\nThen there's a Registry value set event. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The user also ran whoami.exe, which is a normal command to check user identity. The process create events for PowerShell are standard too.\n\nLooking at the files being loaded: several are .dlls from Windows and .NET framework, which are expected. The MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender, which is legitimate. The System.Management.Automation.ni.dll is part of PowerShell, so that's normal.\n\nHowever, the repeated creation and deletion of temporary .ps1 files might be noteworthy. Attackers often use temporary files to execute scripts without leaving permanent traces. The fact that the same script file is created and then deleted could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the activity. Also, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for legitimate DLLs might be normal, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a sign of something.\n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators? The command line for one PowerShell instance is \"& {}\", which is an empty command. That might be a red herring or part of a test. The other PowerShell processes don't have command lines, which could be due to logging configuration, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the temporary script files being created and deleted. However, since these are common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios, it's not definitive. The rest of the events don't show clear signs of compromise. The classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because of the temporary files, but the confidence isn't extremely high. Maybe around 0.65? The justification would be the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts, which could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple temporary PowerShell script files (e.g., __PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1) are created and deleted in the user's Temp directory, which is a common pattern for obfuscating malicious activity. While some events involve legitimate system DLLs, the combination of file creation\/deletion and PowerShell activity warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries with \"powershell.exe\" and various winlog tasks. Some of them are \"Process accessed\" or \"Image loaded\". Then there's one entry where svchost.exe created a file in the Windows ServiceProfiles directory. The path is C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's normal. Maybe that's part of a legitimate process, but I should note it.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that checks if a file exists at C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe. The command is trying to test the path and exit based on whether the file exists. Procdump.exe is a tool that can be used for dumping processes, which might be useful for malware analysis, but if it's not in a standard location, that could be suspicious. The path here seems a bit odd with the \"..\\registro_secundario\" part, which might be an attempt to access a different directory. But I need to check if that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and some from Windows Defender. Loading .NET framework DLLs might be normal for PowerShell scripts, but the Defender DLLs could be related to antivirus checks. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user information. But if it's being run multiple times, maybe that's part of a script or a legitimate process. However, combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nThe File Created event for a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1) in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's a common place for temporary files, but creating a script there could be part of a legitimate process or a malicious one. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell events, some file creation, image loading of various DLLs, and the check for procdump.exe. The procdump check might be a red flag because procdump is a tool that can be used by attackers to dump memory, which is a common malicious activity. The fact that the script is checking for procdump.exe's existence might indicate that the attacker is trying to use it for some purpose. However, the presence of legitimate processes like svchost.exe and whoami.exe might be normal. \n\nBut considering the combination of multiple PowerShell events, the potential use of procdump, and the creation of a temporary script, this might be a sign of a malicious activity. However, I'm not 100% certain because some of these events could be part of a legitimate script or tool usage. The confidence would be moderate, maybe around 0.7. The justification would be the presence of PowerShell activities, potential use of procdump, and the creation of a script file, which are suspicious but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process events with suspicious command-line activity (checking for procdump.exe existence) and temporary script creation, alongside .NET framework DLL loading, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I see there are multiple entries. The first two entries are about processes: powershell.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe entry has a command line that's turning off the firewall with netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off. That's a red flag because disabling the firewall is a common malicious activity. \n\nThen there are a bunch of entries about svchost.exe and registry events. svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's modifying the registry a lot, that might be suspicious. However, svchost.exe is known to host multiple system services, so some registry changes could be normal. But the sheer number of registry events here is high. \n\nWait, the cmd.exe command is definitely a concerning event. Even if the other events are normal, that one command alone would be a reason to flag this. However, I need to check if there's a connection between the processes. For example, if the powershell.exe and svchost.exe events are related to the firewall disablement. But the logs don't show a direct link. \n\nBut the presence of the cmd.exe command to disable the firewall is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Even if the other events are benign, that single action is enough to make this batch interesting. However, I should also consider the confidence level. The command line is clear, so that's a high confidence. \n\nBut wait, are there any other factors? The other svchost.exe entries are all registry events. Maybe the attacker is trying to modify the registry to persist or hide their activities. But without more context, like file changes or network activity, it's harder to tell. However, the firewall disable is a clear sign. \n\nSo, combining the disabling of the firewall with multiple registry changes, even if some are normal, the overall pattern might be suspicious. Therefore, the classification would be INTERESTING with high confidence because of the firewall disablement. The justification would be the attempt to disable the firewall and multiple registry modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious command to disable Windows Firewall via 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off' and multiple registry modification events by svchost.exe, which may indicate persistence or evasion attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first few entries are about svchost.exe triggering registry events. That's normal because svchost hosts various system services, and registry changes can be part of legitimate operations. But then there's a bunch of PowerShell commands.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a pattern with New-PSDrive being used to map a network drive, specifically pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That's suspicious because creating a network drive in this way could be an attempt to access remote systems, maybe for lateral movement. The same command is repeated multiple times, which might indicate an automated process or a script trying to establish persistent access.\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe & {} which is just an empty block. That might be a red herring or a test, but not necessarily malicious. However, the more concerning part is the command that checks for the existence of procdump.exe in a specific directory. ProcDump is a legitimate tool, but if it's being checked in a non-standard path, especially with a structure like ..\\\\registro_secundario, it might be part of an attempt to locate or execute malicious payloads.\n\nThe repetition of these commands, especially the one checking for procdump.exe, suggests that there's an automated process trying to perform certain actions on the system. While some of these could be benign, the combination of network drive creation and checking for specific files in non-standard paths raises flags. The presence of multiple similar events increases the likelihood of malicious activity, even if individual events might not be conclusive. So, this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to create network drives (\\\\Target\\\\C$) and check for procdump.exe in suspicious paths, suggesting potential lateral movement or payload execution.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. All three entries are about PowerShell processes running a script that checks if a file named procdump.exe exists in a specific path. The command line is the same in each case, and the winlog tasks are either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. \n\nFirst, procdump.exe is a known tool, often used for dumping processes, which can be legitimate but also potentially malicious if used without consent. The script is checking for the existence of this file. If it's present, the process exits with 0 (success), else 1 (failure). \n\nNow, why would someone check for procdump.exe? Maybe they're trying to see if it's installed, which could be part of a larger attack. For example, if an attacker wants to use procdump to extract memory dumps for analysis or exfiltration, they might first check if it's available. However, just checking the existence doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious. It could be part of a legitimate script that depends on procdump.\n\nBut looking at the paths involved: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". The use of '..' suggests navigating up a directory, which might be a red flag. It's possible that the actual path is trying to access a different directory than intended, maybe to bypass some restrictions. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe fact that there are three identical events might indicate that this is a recurring check, perhaps part of a scheduled task or a service that's monitoring for the presence of procdump.exe. However, if this is part of a malicious activity, the repetition could be part of an attempt to establish persistence or check for the tool's availability repeatedly.\n\nAnother angle: the PowerShell command is using Test-Path, which is a common method in scripts. But if the script is part of a larger payload, this could be a precursor to downloading or executing procdump.exe. However, the events provided don't show any actual download or execution beyond the check. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, checking for a file's existence isn't inherently malicious. On the other, the specific tool (procdump) and the repetition of the event might raise suspicion. However, without additional events showing the actual use of procdump.exe or other malicious activities, it's hard to confirm. \n\nConsidering the information given, the presence of procdump.exe in the path and the repetitive checks might be worth investigating, but it's not conclusive. The confidence is moderate, so maybe 0.6. The justification would be that the batch shows repeated checks for procdump.exe, which could be part of malicious activity, but more data is needed for confirmation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repeated PowerShell checks for the presence of procdump.exe in a non-standard path, which could indicate reconnaissance for potential malicious use of the tool.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
