{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with ProcessAccess events. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is a normal command to check the current user. But then I see cmd.exe being used with a command line that includes creating a service with a path pointing to a non-existent script: c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename is NonExistingScript.ps1, which suggests that the attacker is trying to create a service that points to a script that doesn't exist. That's a red flag because it might be an attempt to execute a malicious script later or set up persistence.\n\nLooking further, there's another cmd.exe command that tries to start a script named componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1, which also doesn't exist. The use of sc.exe to create services with these non-existent scripts is suspicious. Also, the command_line parameter in one of the entries has \"cmd \/c start c:\\\\...\" which is a way to execute commands and then close the command prompt. \n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value set events. While some registry changes are normal, the fact that services.exe and svchost.exe are involved in setting registry values might indicate something's wrong. However, services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so that might not be the issue. \n\nAnother thing is the Image loaded events for urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a sign of something malicious. However, since the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location, it might just be normal activity. \n\nWait, but the main issue here is the use of sc.exe to create a service with a non-existent script. That's a common tactic used by malware to establish persistence. Even though the script doesn't exist now, the attacker might plan to create it later or use the service to execute commands when the script is placed. Also, the fact that the same pattern is repeated with different filenames suggests a possible attempt to set up multiple persistence mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, the presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for cmd.exe and sc.exe with these suspicious command lines indicates that someone is trying to manipulate the system's services. Even if the scripts aren't present yet, this is a strong indicator of malicious activity. \n\nI should also check for any other signs. The 'notepad.exe' and 'RuntimeBroker.exe' entries with Registry changes don't seem immediately suspicious, but combined with the other events, it adds to the overall pattern. The repeated use of 'Registry value set' events might be part of configuring the system for persistence or altering settings to avoid detection.\n\nIn conclusion, the key points are the creation of services pointing to non-existent scripts, the use of sc.exe and cmd.exe in ways that are typically associated with malicious activities, and the multiple registry changes. These indicators together suggest that this batch of events is likely related to an attempted intrusion or persistence mechanism setup. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: (1) Use of 'sc.exe' to create services with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), suggesting potential persistence mechanism setup. (2) Repeated 'Registry value set' events involving system processes like 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe', which may indicate configuration changes. (3) 'cmd.exe' executing commands to manipulate services, a common tactic in malware persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there are several entries about ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe modifying registry values. Registry changes can be suspicious, especially if they're from unexpected processes.\n\nWait, the Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry? That's unusual. Those are typically not involved in registry changes. Then there's powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for malicious activities. \n\nLooking further, chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry value sets. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that's a red flag. Also, there are image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender components. If they're being loaded by chrome.exe, maybe there's an attempt to bypass security features. \n\nBut wait, the amsi.dll path is the standard one. Maybe that's normal. However, the MpOAV.dll path is from Windows Defender, but the version might be unusual. However, the logs don't mention any anomalies in those files. \n\nThe key points here are the unexpected processes modifying the registry and the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or network activity, it's a bit hard to tell. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a config file might be benign, but combined with the other events, it could indicate a setup for something malicious. \n\nBut I need to be careful. The justification for \"INTERESTING\" should be based on the combination of events. The multiple registry modifications by non-standard processes and chrome.exe might be worth investigating. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because some events could be normal. Maybe around 0.65?\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by non-standard processes (Calculator.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe) and chrome.exe loading Windows Defender DLLs may indicate suspicious activity or potential bypass attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
