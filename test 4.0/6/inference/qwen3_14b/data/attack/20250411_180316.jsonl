So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe triggering Registry value set events. Those are common processes, so maybe normal. But then there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, but loading it from System32 seems okay. However, I notice Calculator.exe also loaded urlmon.dll. Hmm, maybe that's normal too.\n\nLooking further, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a log shipper, so maybe part of normal operations. But the file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which could be a config file being written. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command that deletes notepad.exe processes using wmic. That's a red flag. Deleting processes can be part of malware trying to remove itself. Also, the command line is \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That's suspicious because it's forcefully terminating processes, which might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nNext, WMIC.exe is involved, which is a known tool for remote management but can be abused. The image loaded events for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is related to anti-malware scanning, but if it's being loaded by WMIC, maybe that's unusual. However, I need to check if there's any other signs.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed or creating registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The fact that there's a whoami.exe command might be checking user context, which is common in attacks.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of cmd.exe and wmic deleting processes, along with multiple PowerShell and WMIC activities, could indicate an attempt to manipulate the system. The deletion of notepad.exe processes might be to remove evidence or prevent monitoring. The use of urlmon.dll and amsi.dll in image loads might be part of evasion techniques. However, some events are normal, like svchost.exe and calc.exe. But the combination of these suspicious commands and processes might be worth investigating.

That's a legitimate Windows system file, so maybe that's normal. But then there are multiple entries for svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe with various registry events and process accesses. \n\nHmm, registry value sets and process accesses are common in normal operations, but when they're excessive or from unexpected processes, they can be a red flag. There's also a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign but could be part of a larger attack if used inappropriately. \n\nWait, the chrome.exe entries have image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Microsoft Defender. Loading these could be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, maybe there's something wrong. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so that's probably okay.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, but it's also a legitimate tool. The fact that there are multiple process creates and accesses might indicate some automated activity or scripting. However, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry value sets could indicate configuration changes, which might be part of a compromise. However, without seeing the actual registry keys being modified or any suspicious values, it's hard to confirm. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events don't show clear signs of malware or obvious malicious activity. They are mostly legitimate processes performing normal tasks. However, the high frequency of certain events and the involvement of PowerShell and command-line tools might warrant further investigation. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior like unexpected file access, network connections, or privilege escalation, maybe it's not interesting enough. \n\nWait, the first event had schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's normal. The chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll is also normal. The rest are standard system processes. The justification here might be that there's no clear malicious activity detected. The confidence would be low to medium because while the events are not obviously benign, they don't show clear signs of an attack. However, without more data, it's hard to be certain. \n\nSo, I think the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity.

Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The events include process creation, access, registry changes, and image loading. \n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are references to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so loading them might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require .NET. However, there's also a mention of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe it's being loaded in an unusual context?\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That's interesting. The name suggests it might be related to testing script policies, which could be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers use similar names to hide malicious scripts. However, the file is created and then immediately deleted, which might be a sign of a temporary action, maybe part of a legitimate process or a quick cleanup by malware.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}'. That seems like a no-op command, which might be part of a test or a way to trigger events without actual payload. But why so many of them? Maybe the system is configured to log these events, but the presence of so many could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably part of a legitimate monitoring setup. But if this is unexpected, it might be worth looking into.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events involve PowerShell, which is normal, but the combination of multiple registry changes, image loads of .NET components, a temporary script file being created and deleted, and the numerous lifecycle events might indicate something unusual. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments, network activity, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to be certain. The presence of Windows Defender's DLL being loaded might be normal, but the overall pattern could be part of a legitimate process or a test.

That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData folder. Not sure yet, but maybe that's part of a script.\n\nNext, there are several registry value set events and process accessed events. Those could be normal, but when combined with other activities, they might be suspicious. Then there's the whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool for checking user context. That's probably benign.\n\nLooking at the command lines for powershell.exe, there are a bunch of Test-Path commands checking for the existence of various .bat files. The paths have a pattern with ..\\, which might be trying to navigate up directories. That could be a red flag, especially if they're checking for scripts in unexpected locations. However, the exit codes are 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists, which might just be a way to check for presence without executing them. But why so many different paths? Maybe trying to find a specific script?\n\nAnother thing is that the same Test-Path command is repeated multiple times with different paths. That could indicate an attempt to locate a script in different directories, which might be part of a larger attack, like looking for a payload or checking for the presence of a backdoor.

The fact that they're using PowerShell to check paths might be part of a legitimate process, but the repetition and the specific paths could be suspicious.\n\nThe image loaded events for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are part of .NET, which is normal for PowerShell, so that's probably okay. The registry events and process accesses might be part of normal operations, but combined with the Test-Path checks, it could be a sign of something more.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes running with Test-Path commands checking for .bat files in various locations, along with registry and file operations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries where PowerShell is loading images, like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. These are all legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. That's a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it quickly might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a test or a temporary file. However, the names here seem a bit generic, maybe part of a script policy test. \n\nThen there's another file created in the Downloads folder: elemento_padrao.txt. That's a regular text file, so maybe not suspicious. But the fact that PowerShell is creating files in Temp and Downloads could be normal, but combined with other events?\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are some PowerShell commands checking if certain paths exist and exiting with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned are like C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\.. etc. These paths have some strange folder names, maybe obfuscated or part of a script that's trying to avoid detection. The use of Test-Path and exiting based on that could be part of a script that's checking for the presence of certain files, which might be part of a larger process, like a dropper or something that's waiting for a file to be present before proceeding.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events from Chrome.exe. That's a lot of registry changes. Chrome might be doing some legitimate stuff, but multiple registry events could indicate some kind of modification or configuration change. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But combined with PowerShell activities, maybe there's something going on.\n\nThe Pipe Created event from PowerShell could be part of inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other events, it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nNow, considering all these together: multiple PowerShell activities, loading system DLLs (which could be normal), creating and deleting temporary files, checking for specific paths, and registry changes from Chrome. The key points here are the PowerShell script creation and deletion, the Test-Path commands with obfuscated paths, and the multiple registry events. \n\nHowever, the files created are in standard locations (Temp and Downloads), and the names don't look like they're part of a known malicious payload. The fact that the script is deleted immediately after creation might be part of a test or a legitimate process. The registry changes from Chrome might be normal, but the quantity is a bit high. \n\nBut considering that the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I need to decide if these events are suspicious enough. The presence of multiple PowerShell events, especially with file creation and deletion, and the Test-Path commands with obfuscated paths could indicate a potential security incident. However, without more context or indicators of compromise (like unexpected network activity, unusual process behavior, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nOn the other hand, some of these events could be part of normal system operations, like script testing or Windows Defender updates. The loading of Defender DLLs is normal. The registry changes from Chrome might be related to extensions or settings. \n\nSo the justification here is that while some events are normal, the combination of PowerShell activities involving temporary files and obfuscated paths might be worth investigating further. However, without more evidence, it's not conclusive. The answer should probably be that it's somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious. However, the user's system might need to check these events for more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity (Legitimate vs. Suspicious):**\n   - **Legitimate:** \n     - Loading system DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) is normal for PowerShell and Windows Defender operations.\n     - File creation in standard locations (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) aligns with PowerShell's default behavior.\n   - **Suspicious:**\n     - **Temporary script creation\/deletion:** The script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1` is created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. While this could be a test, the name (`PSScriptPolicyTest`) is not a standard system script, and such behavior may indicate obfuscation or evasion.\n     - **Obfuscated paths in `Test-Path` commands:** The paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\elemento_auxiliar\\componente_secundario_script.bat`) contain non-standard, possibly obfuscated folder names. This could hint at a script probing for the existence of files or directories, potentially part of a dropper or persistence mechanism.\n\n2. **Registry Activity:**\n   - **Chrome.exe:** Multiple registry value changes from Chrome may indicate legitimate configuration updates, but the lack of context (e.g., no associated process or user action) raises questions. If these changes are unrelated to user activity, they could signal tampering.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - The `Pipe Created` event from PowerShell is neutral on its own but could be part of inter-process communication (IPC) in a larger attack chain (e.g., data exfiltration or command-and-control).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Moderate Risk:** \n  - **Legitimate components** (e.g., Windows Defender DLLs, PowerShell) are involved, and some file operations (e.g., temporary script creation) are common in testing or scripting.\n  - **Suspicious patterns** (obfuscated paths, frequent registry changes) could indicate **malicious activity** but are not conclusive without additional context (e.g., network traffic, anomalous process behavior).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the PowerShell scripts:**\n   - Check if `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1` or similar scripts are part of authorized testing or if they contain malicious payloads.\n   - Analyze the `Test-Path` commands for their purpose (e.g., checking for the presence of files, waiting for triggers).\n\n2. **Monitor Chrome's registry activity:**\n   - Correlate registry changes with Chrome's process behavior (e.g., extensions, user actions) to determine if they are legitimate.\n\n3. **Check for lateral movement:**\n   - The obfuscated paths and PowerShell activity could be part of a broader attack (e.g., fileless malware, persistence mechanisms). Look for related events (e.g., network connections, process creation).\n\n4. **Review system logs for anomalies:**\n   - Cross-reference these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, process execution) to identify potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **some events are benign**, the combination of **PowerShell script creation\/deletion**, **obfuscated paths**, and **unusual registry activity** suggests **potential malicious behavior** that merits closer scrutiny. This batch is **interesting for investigation** but not definitively malicious without further evidence."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve PowerShell.exe. There are several process create, process access, registry value set, and image loaded events. The command lines in some of the processes show PowerShell commands that are creating new items (files) and setting their content to \"dir\". For example, New-Item is used to create a file, and then Set-Content writes \"dir\" into it. \n\nNow, creating files and writing scripts is normal, but the pattern here seems repetitive. There are multiple instances of PowerShell creating files in different directories, each time with similar commands. The paths are all over the place, but the commands are consistent. Also, the use of \"..\\\" in the paths might be a red flag. That's a common technique in attacks to navigate directories in a way that might bypass some security checks or obfuscate the actual path.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, PowerShell is loading several DLLs related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While loading these DLLs isn't inherently malicious, the combination with the PowerShell activities might indicate something. However, the main concern here is the repeated file creation and modification.\n\nAnother thing is the \"Provider Lifecycle\" task in some events. That might relate to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or other providers, which can be used by malware for persistence or execution. But without more context, it's a bit hard to tell.\n\nThe key points here are the repetitive use of PowerShell to create and modify files with \"dir\" as the content. The \"dir\" command is a basic directory listing, but if this is part of a larger script or if these files are being used as part of a multi-stage attack, that could be concerning. However, since all the commands are simple and don't involve downloading or executing malicious payloads, it might be benign. \n\nBut wait, the fact that there are so many similar events across different directories could be an indicator of automated or scripted behavior. Maybe the attacker is trying to create multiple scripts in various locations to avoid detection. However, the lack of other suspicious activities like network connections, unusual registry changes, or execution of unknown binaries makes it less certain.\n\nI need to weigh the repetitive PowerShell activity against the absence of other red flags. If this were a single event, it might not be concerning, but the batch nature of these events with similar patterns increases the suspicion. The confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but the pattern is enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating and modifying files across the system with consistent patterns (e.g., 'New-Item' followed by 'Set-Content -Value \\\"dir\\\"'), which may indicate automated script deployment or obfuscation techniques.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these logs together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved, almost all of them are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines in some of the events show PowerShell commands creating files, like New-Item and Set-Content. For example, one event creates a file and sets its content to \"dir\". That might be part of a script that's trying to execute commands or modify the system.\n\nThen there are events where files are created and then deleted. Like the temporary file __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 is created and then deleted. That could be a red flag because sometimes malware creates temporary files to execute malicious code and then deletes them to avoid leaving evidence. But it's also possible that this is part of a normal script execution, especially if it's related to PowerShell's own operations.\n\nThere's also the creation of multiple batch files in various directories. The paths mentioned have some unusual structures, like using \"..\\\" to navigate up directories. This might be an attempt to obfuscate the file paths or access sensitive areas of the file system. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just a script that's not well written.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are image loads from .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are normal parts of the .NET runtime, so that's probably just PowerShell running normally. But the repeated image loads might be part of a larger process that's more suspicious.\n\nThe Registry value set events could indicate changes to system settings or policies. If an attacker is modifying registry keys, that could be a sign of persistence or configuration changes. However, again, this could be part of a legitimate script's operation.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes creating and deleting files, writing to the file system, and modifying registry values. The use of PowerShell for these actions is common in both benign and malicious scenarios. However, the combination of creating files in non-standard paths, using relative paths, and the presence of both file creation and deletion might suggest an attempt to hide activities. \n\nBut there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. For example, there's no mention of network connections, unusual command-line arguments, or known malicious payloads. The events are all related to file operations and registry changes, which can be part of normal administrative tasks. \n\nHowever, the fact that the same process is creating multiple files and then deleting them, along with the use of PowerShell for these operations, might warrant further investigation. The confidence here is a bit medium because while the activities are not obviously malicious, they do exhibit some patterns that are often seen in suspicious behavior. But without more data, like network activity or unexpected processes, it's hard to be certain. So, I think the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, as there are enough suspicious elements to warrant a closer look but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating and modifying files across various directories, including temporary and system paths, with some files being deleted immediately after creation.

Most of them involve PowerShell processes with command lines that check for the existence of certain batch files. The paths mentioned are a mix of seemingly random directories and filenames, like \"modulo_secundario\", \"elemento_padrao\", etc. But wait, those might be obfuscated or encoded paths. Sometimes attackers use such naming to hide malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most are \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\", which might be normal, but others like \"File created\" and \"File Delete logged\" are also present. There's a mention of temporary files being created and deleted, which is common, but the repeated pattern of checking for specific batch files could be a red flag. \n\nThen there's an entry about a file being created in the Temp directory, which is often used by malware to execute scripts. Also, the presence of \"MpOAV.dll\" and \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender might be normal, but if there's unusual activity around them, that's suspicious. However, in this case, the events don't show any direct interaction with those DLLs beyond loading, which is standard.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of PowerShell to check for the existence of batch files. If these batch files are not present, the script exits with 1. That might be part of a larger attack chain where the presence of certain files indicates a compromised system. However, without more context, like actual malicious activity or unexpected network traffic, it's hard to say. \n\nBut considering that all these events are related to PowerShell checking for files, and the paths are not standard, this could be part of an attempt to execute or check for malicious scripts. The fact that there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory might be an indicator of a temporary script execution, which is often used in attacks.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack here—just these checks.

Each of these commands checks if a specific executable exists in a certain path and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. \n\nHmm, the paths mentioned like \"C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base...\" don't look standard. They have a lot of nested directories with names that aren't typical for Windows system files. That might be a red flag.

The use of 'Test-Path' and exiting with 0 or 1 might be a way to silently check if files exist without triggering alerts, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' event might indicate that the attacker is modifying registry settings, possibly to persist the attack or change system behavior. However, there's not enough information here to confirm that. But combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and checking file existence is a standard operation. However, the combination of multiple such checks with non-standard paths and the loading of .NET DLLs increases the likelihood of malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. The presence of multiple suspicious patterns, even if some could be normal, when taken together, suggests a higher confidence that this is worth investigating. The classification here would likely be 'INTERESTING' with a confidence around 0.7 to 0.8, as there are enough indicators of potential malicious behavior without being 100% certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands that check for the existence of non-standard executable files in deeply nested, obfuscated paths.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File deleted, Pipe created, Registry value set, and Process accessed. There are also some cmd.exe and whoami.exe processes. \n\nLooking at the files mentioned, there's a couple of temporary files created and deleted in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The paths like C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform... are legitimate, so those might be normal Defender activities. However, the PowerShell scripts in the Temp folder might be suspicious. \n\nThe command lines for PowerShell are checking if certain executables exist and exiting with 0 or 1. That could be part of a script that's checking for presence of files, maybe as part of a setup or cleanup. But why so many PowerShell events? Also, there are multiple Registry value set events and Process accessed events, which might indicate some level of system modification or monitoring.\n\nWait, but are there any signs of malicious activity? The files being created and deleted in Temp are common in legitimate scripts too. However, the repeated use of PowerShell for these tasks, along with ProcessAccess and Registry events, might be indicative of something. However, without more context like unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files, it's hard to say. \n\nThe presence of whoami.exe and cmd.exe is normal. The key here is whether these events are out of the ordinary for the system. Since the user hasn't provided baseline data, I have to rely on the events themselves. \n\nBut looking at the events again, the main thing is that PowerShell is involved in creating and deleting files, but nothing that's clearly malicious. The classification might be 'NOT INTERESTING' because these are common administrative tasks. However, the high number of events and the specific paths might be a red flag. \n\nWait, the confidence should be based on how likely it is to be malicious. Since there's no direct evidence like downloading from a malicious URL, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive data, it's probably not interesting. The justification would be that these are typical system activities, even though there's a lot of PowerShell usage. But maybe the fact that they're creating and deleting files in Temp could be part of a benign script. \n\nAlternatively, if the system is supposed to have minimal PowerShell activity, this might be unusual. But without knowing the system's normal behavior, it's safer to say not interesting. So the classification is NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.5. The justification is that the events are common system activities without clear signs of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect common system activities (e.g., PowerShell script execution, temporary file creation\/deletion, Defender DLL loading) without clear indicators of malicious behavior or security violations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines representing system events. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about PowerShell.exe processes. There are multiple instances of 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. The 'ProcessCreate' events have command lines that are checking if certain files exist. For example, the command line is using Test-Path to check for specific .cs files. \n\nWait, the command lines are all similar. They're checking if a particular .cs file exists and exiting 0 or 1 based on that. That seems odd. Why would someone run PowerShell repeatedly to check for the existence of these files? Maybe they're part of a script that's looking for certain conditions.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' task, some are 'ProcessAccess', 'ProcessCreate', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. The 'Image loaded' events mention loading .dll files related to .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe in combination with other events, it could be suspicious.\n\nBut the main thing here is the repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific files. The paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands are all in different directories and have similar naming patterns. They might be checking for the presence of certain files as part of a larger operation, like a payload delivery or checking for a specific environment.\n\nHowever, all these events are just process creation and access. There's no indication of malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying system settings. The commands themselves are benign—just checking file existence. \n\nBut wait, the fact that there are so many of these PowerShell commands checking for these specific .cs files might be a red flag. It could be a sign of an attacker probing the system for certain files that might be part of a larger attack chain. However, without more context or other malicious activities, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nOn the other hand, the presence of multiple 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs is normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET assemblies. So that's not necessarily suspicious.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch shows a lot of PowerShell activity, but the individual events don't clearly indicate malicious behavior. It's possible that this is just normal system activity, or maybe part of a legitimate script. However, the high number of PowerShell processes and the specific file checks might warrant further investigation. \n\nI think the classification here would be 'INTERESTING' because the repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific files could be indicative of something more, even if it's not conclusive.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll go through each entry to see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File deleted, Pipe Created, and Registry value set. There are also some Process accessed events. The files mentioned are mostly in temporary directories or related to Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. \n\nWait, the first event has a file path pointing to Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a File created event for a temporary script file, which is then deleted. That could be part of normal PowerShell operations, like running a script temporarily. However, the presence of multiple FileCreate and FileDelete events might be suspicious if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the command lines, several entries have PowerShell scripts checking if certain files exist. For example, Test-Path with paths like \"C:\\estrutura_temporario...\" and exiting 0 or 1 based on that. These could be benign checks, but if these paths are part of a malicious script's execution flow, it might be a red flag. \n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool for checking user identity. But combined with the PowerShell activities, maybe it's part of a larger attack. However, on its own, whoami isn't suspicious.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. The repeated use of PowerShell to check for the existence of specific files, especially with paths that have varying directories (like tarefa_geral, objeto_temporario, etc.), might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a specific script or file. The fact that multiple checks are done across different paths could be a sign of probing the system for the presence of certain malicious files or trying to execute them if they exist.\n\nThe temporary script files being created and deleted might be part of a technique to avoid leaving traces, but that's common in both benign and malicious activities. However, when combined with the multiple Test-Path commands, it might suggest that the attacker is looking for a specific script to execute, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but if they're being used in an unusual context, it could be noteworthy. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI need to check if any of the files mentioned are known malicious. The MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are part of Windows Defender, so those are legitimate. The temporary files created are in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for temporary scripts. However, the repeated checking of multiple paths for a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various locations might be suspicious. Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. If that script exists and is being accessed, it could be a sign of keylogging malware.\n\nBut wait, the events don't show the actual execution of these scripts, just the existence checks. The PowerShell commands are exiting based on whether the file exists. So maybe the attacker is checking if the script is present, and if so, proceeds with some action. However, without seeing the actual execution or the content of the script, it's hard to confirm. But the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in multiple paths could be a red flag, even if it's just being checked for existence.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of multiple Test-Path commands for scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across various directories, along with the creation and deletion of temporary files, might indicate an attempt to locate and execute a malicious script. Even though some activities are normal, the specific naming of the script and the repetitive checks could be indicative of a security threat. Therefore, this batch of events is worth further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several characteristics that warrant further investigation, though they do not definitively confirm malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity with Temporary Files:**\n   - Multiple **FileCreate** and **FileDelete** events involve temporary PowerShell scripts (e.g., `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`) in directories like `AppData\\Local\\Temp` or custom paths (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_temporario...`). \n   - While temporary script creation\/deletion is common, the **repeated checks** for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across **multiple, varied paths** (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario...`, `C:\\objeto_temporario...`) suggest **probing for a specific script**. The name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is **suspicious**, as it aligns with **keylogging behavior** (common in malware).\n\n2. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Components:**\n   - **Legitimate Activity:** \n     - References to `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components) are normal.\n     - `whoami.exe` is a standard utility for checking user identity.\n   - **Suspicious Patterns:**\n     - **Repeated `Test-Path` commands** in PowerShell scripts (e.g., `if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }`) may indicate **probing for the presence of a malicious file** or **attempting to execute it conditionally**.\n     - The **variety of paths** checked for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` implies **targeted searching**, which is inconsistent with benign operations.\n\n3. **Lack of Direct Malicious Activity:**\n   - No events show **actual execution** of the scripts (e.g., `Invoke-Expression`, `Start-Process`), only **existence checks**.\n   - No **malicious payloads** or **network activity** are indicated in the logs.\n\n### **Indicators of Potential Concern:**\n- **Unusual Script Naming:** `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a **red flag** for keylogging behavior, even if not explicitly executed.\n- **Repetitive File Checks:** The **multiple `Test-Path` commands** across disparate paths suggest **active probing**, which may precede exploitation.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The scripts’ purpose (e.g., why check for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in so many locations?) is unclear and warrants deeper analysis.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the Scripts:** Check if `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` exists on the system and analyze its contents.\n- **Monitor for Execution:** Confirm whether the scripts are executed (e.g., via logs, process monitoring).\n- **Contextual Analysis:** Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, registry changes) to determine if they are part of a larger attack chain.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events **do not confirm malicious activity**, the combination of **suspicious script names**, **repetitive file checks**, and **lack of clear benign purpose** makes this batch **worthy of further investigation**. The activity could represent **preparation for exploitation**, **data exfiltration**, or **malware deployment**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. There are several instances where the command line includes a Test-Path check for a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories. The paths are all over the place, like C:\\registro_base\\entrada_base\\objeto_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1, C:\\unidade_temporario\\registro_temporario\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1, and others. \n\nWait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is typically used for keylogging. That's definitely a red flag. The fact that the script is being checked for existence in multiple locations might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate or deploy this malicious script. \n\nAlso, there are events related to file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 is created and then deleted. That could be part of a script execution that's trying to evade detection by cleaning up after itself. \n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events. PowerShell is loading several DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but combined with the other activities, it's worth noting. \n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of normal operations, but if this is unexpected, it could be something else. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell activities and the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated checks for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various directories, along with the file creation and deletion in Temp, suggest that there might be an attempt to deploy or execute a keylogging script. Even though some events are normal (like image loading), the combination of these PowerShell commands and the specific script name points towards a potential security threat. \n\nI should classify this as INTERESTING because the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, because the script's name is directly associated with keystroke logging, which is a clear sign of a potential attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various directories, which is a strong indicator of potential keylogging malware deployment.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's part of PowerShell's startup profiles, but maybe it's normal. However, creating files in user-specific directories isn't always bad, but I should note it.\n\nNext, there are several entries about registry value sets and process accesses involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but frequent registry changes or process accesses could indicate something like a script modifying system settings or trying to inject code. But I need more context.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so that's probably normal. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are also common, but the registry changes here might be benign. However, the repeated process accesses by powershell.exe could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events: urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, so that's probably okay. The winlogbeat file creation seems like a user downloading and setting up a tool, which is normal if they're using it for monitoring. But if it's unexpected, that might be an issue.\n\nNetwork connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome doing network activity is normal, especially if it's browsing. Svchost.exe hosting services might be connecting to known hosts, but if there are unusual destinations, that's a problem. However, the logs don't mention specific IPs or domains, so it's hard to tell.\n\nMultiple entries of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is powerful, and if it's being used excessively without clear purpose, that might be malicious. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat suggests that someone might be monitoring the system, which is normal for security purposes. However, if the user didn't initiate that, it could be an indicator of compromise.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several suspicious activities like frequent PowerShell usage, registry modifications, and file creations. However, some of these could be legitimate. The confidence is moderate because while there are indicators that could be malicious, they aren't definitive.

So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first line: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, maybe browsing. Then powershell.exe being accessed a few times. The next entry is whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool but sometimes used in attacks. Then there's a process create for powershell with a command line that's listing files recursively. That's a common PowerShell command, but maybe part of a script.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple image loads related to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal. However, there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting files quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The file name has \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which sounds like a script, but the deletion might be to remove evidence.\n\nAlso, there are several Pipe Created events. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if there's a lot of them, it might indicate something suspicious. The command line in some entries shows \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\" which are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. That's common, but combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nThe user mentioned that the justification should be concise. The key points here are the repeated PowerShell activity, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and the loading of .NET components. While some activities are normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to execute a script, possibly malicious. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.

First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity involving PowerShell.exe. The command lines show commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These are PowerShell commands for listing files recursively. While listing files isn't inherently malicious, the repetition and the number of times it's appearing might be a red flag. \n\nThen, there's an event where PowerShell.exe is involved in creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files or configuration data. Also, there's a file created in the Downloads folder named 'estrutura_secundario.txt'—the name doesn't seem suspicious, but the context matters.\n\nAnother point is the involvement of winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The event shows it creating a .yml.new file. That might be part of normal operations if it's just configuring itself, but if there's unexpected activity here, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nThere are also registry value set events related to PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's benign or malicious.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The repeated PowerShell commands and file creations in user directories might indicate something, but they could also be part of legitimate activities like scripting or setup processes. However, the combination of these events, especially the multiple file creations and registry changes, does raise some suspicion. \n\nI think the classification here should be \"INTERESTING\" because while none of the individual events are obviously malicious, the pattern of activity involving PowerShell, file creation in sensitive directories, and registry changes could be indicative of a potential security incident.
