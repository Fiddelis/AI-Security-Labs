{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are multiple entries with PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe. They're setting up scheduled tasks that trigger at logon, with the Administrators group and highest run level. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nThe winlog tasks mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" and other events like Registry value set and Process accessed. But the key part is the PowerShell commands. The repetition of similar commands across different task names (unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.) might indicate an automated script trying to create multiple scheduled tasks. \n\nAlso, there are entries where PowerShell loads .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. While these are legitimate, the combination with the scheduled task creation could be part of a more complex attack, like using .NET to execute malicious code or bypass defenses.\n\nHowever, the justification needs to be concise. The main red flags are the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin rights and execution of calc.exe, which is a known indicator of malicious activity. Even though calc.exe is a benign application, when used in this context, it's often a sign of testing or malicious payload delivery. \n\nThe confidence level should be high because multiple events show the same pattern, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior. But since there's no direct evidence of a payload (other than calc.exe, which could be a red herring), maybe confidence is around 0.85. But I need to check if there's any other info. The other events with chrome.exe and pipe created don't seem related. The main focus is on PowerShell and scheduled tasks. \n\nSo, the classification is INTERESTING because of the repeated suspicious PowerShell commands creating admin-level scheduled tasks. The justification would be the multiple instances of creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and the use of PowerShell for this, which is often seen in attacks. Confidence is high but not 1.0 because it's possible that this is a legitimate script, but the pattern is too suspicious to ignore.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) targeting the Administrators group, executing calc.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate system files, part of .NET and Windows Defender. Loading them isn't necessarily bad, but maybe if there's an unusual pattern here.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a temp file could be normal, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving traces. However, the name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like a legitimate test script. Maybe part of a security check?\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command that creates a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group having highest privileges. That's suspicious. Calc.exe is a common example used in demos, but if this is part of a malicious script, it could be a way to execute arbitrary code with admin rights. The command line shows the use of ScheduledTask cmdlets, which can be abused for persistence.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. But Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much. However, if it's doing it repeatedly, maybe it's part of some malicious activity, but without more context, it's hard to say. The same registry event is logged multiple times, which might indicate something automated.\n\nThere are also several entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" from processes that are None. That's odd. If the process field is None, maybe the event is from a service or a system component that doesn't have an associated process. But repeated remote command executions could be a sign of something like a remote access tool or a compromised system.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell activities, especially the scheduled task creation, seem suspicious. Creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be a way to maintain access. The temp file creation and deletion might be part of that process. However, some of the events could be benign, like normal .NET operations or Defender updates. But the combination of PowerShell doing these things, along with the remote command executions, raises a red flag. The Chrome registry changes are a bit confusing but might not be directly related unless there's more context. \n\nConfidence-wise, there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of a breach. So the classification is probably INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior: creating a scheduled task with admin privileges to execute calc.exe, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of system DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task. But the process and file are None, which might mean that the logs are incomplete or maybe from a source that doesn't capture those details. However, repeated remote command executions could be a red flag, especially if they're coming from unknown sources or without proper context.\n\nThen, there's an entry with a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task. The command_line shows using New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, which is a common technique for persistence. The trigger is set at logon, and it's targeting the Administrators group with high privileges. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be an attempt to maintain access.\n\nNext, there's a WmiPrvSE.exe process loading taskschd.dll. WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. While this isn't inherently malicious, if it's loading from an unexpected place or in an unusual context, it could be a sign of something wrong. But the file path here is the standard System32 location, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there are several svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes could be part of normal operations, but multiple changes might indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nOne entry shows svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum\". That's a scheduled task folder, so maybe related to the earlier PowerShell command. If that's a legitimate task, it's okay, but if it's being created without user knowledge, that's a problem.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nChrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are Windows Defender components. Loading them might be normal, but if Chrome is doing this, it could be a sign of tampering or evasion techniques. However, it's also possible that this is just Chrome interacting with the system normally.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation, but if it's in a user's Downloads folder, that might be unusual. However, the user might be configuring it manually.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges is a significant indicator. The repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events could be part of the same attack. The creation of the task in the Tasks directory might be a result of that PowerShell script. While some events are normal (like Chrome loading Defender DLLs), the combination of scheduled task creation, remote command executions, and registry changes could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute commands remotely. However, without more context like IP addresses, user accounts, or other indicators of compromise, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of a scheduled task with Admin rights and the PowerShell script seems like a strong indicator. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75 because there are clear suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events combined with a PowerShell script creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges (Administrators group, RunLevel Highest) suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the data. All the events are in JSONL format. Let me go through each line.\n\nThe first eight entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set task. The winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and the file is None. Now, chrome.exe is a common browser, but modifying the registry could be suspicious. However, if it's just setting values, maybe it's normal behavior. But if it's doing this repeatedly, maybe that's a sign of something else. But I need to check all events.\n\nThen, the ninth event is another registry value set by chrome.exe. Wait, no, the ninth is a DNS query. So that's different. The tenth event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's not expected. The eleventh event is powershell.exe creating a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a file might be normal unless it's part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nNow, the key here is to look for any suspicious patterns. Multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be part of a legitimate process, but maybe not. However, the presence of winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file might be part of a setup or configuration change. The PowerShell event creating a file might be benign, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch as a whole is interesting. All the events are from different processes. Chrome doing registry changes multiple times, but that's a lot. However, maybe it's just a normal process. The other events are file creation by winlogbeat and PowerShell. Are these events indicative of malicious activity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe are suspicious. But I need to check if that's normal. Chrome might update registry settings for its own configuration. However, if it's doing this multiple times in a short period, that could be a sign of something else. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say.\n\nThe other events don't seem immediately suspicious. The winlogbeat file is a new configuration file, which could be part of an update or setup. The PowerShell-created file could be a temporary file or part of a script. However, if these events are part of a larger pattern, but in isolation, they might not be enough.\n\nHmm. The classification is whether the batch is interesting. If there's no clear malicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. But the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe could be a red flag. However, I'm not sure. Maybe the user is trying to test if I can spot that multiple registry events from chrome are suspicious. But I need to be cautious. Without more data, it's hard to be certain. Maybe the confidence is medium. But I need to decide based on the given data.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might not be enough on its own. The other events are normal. So maybe the classification is not interesting. But I'm not 100% sure. The confidence would be low to medium. But the justification would be that there's no clear malicious activity, even though there are multiple registry events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal process activities (chrome.exe registry modifications, winlogbeat file creation, and PowerShell file creation).
