{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll go through each entry to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is accessing a process. Then there's whoami.exe being created, which is a common command to get user info. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. Wait, looking at the command line for one of the cmd.exe entries, there's a REG ADD command adding an entry to the Run key in the registry. That's suspicious because adding to the Run key can be used to persist malware after reboot. \n\nAnother entry shows reg.exe adding another entry to the Run key. That's a red flag. Then there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt. Not sure about that yet. Also, winlogbeat.exe is creating a file, which might be part of normal operations, but the other entries are more concerning.\n\nLooking at the sequence: multiple process creations and registry modifications. The use of cmd.exe and reg.exe to modify the registry's Run key suggests someone is trying to set up persistence. Also, the repeated use of powershell.exe might be for executing commands or downloading files. \n\nThe file created by powershell.exe is modulo_padrao.txt, but that's a text file, maybe just a log or something. However, the other entries with registry changes are more indicative of malicious activity. Also, the fact that multiple processes are accessing each other and modifying the registry could be part of a larger attack, like installing a backdoor or malware that starts on boot.\n\nI should check if there's any other suspicious activity. The winlogbeat entries might be part of the system's logging, but the other events are more concerning. The combination of registry modifications in the Run key, using cmd and reg, and multiple powershell accesses is a pattern often seen in attacks. \n\nConfidence-wise, the presence of registry persistence and multiple process creations with command-line arguments that modify the registry points towards a potential security incident. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.85. The justification is the suspicious registry modifications and the use of commands to set up persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including registry modifications in the Run key (common for persistence), use of cmd.exe\/reg.exe for registry manipulation, and repeated process access by powershell.exe, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
