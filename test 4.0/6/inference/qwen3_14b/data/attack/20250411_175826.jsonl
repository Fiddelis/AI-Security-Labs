{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's powershell.exe involved in several activities. Let me check those.\n\nThere's a process access event for powershell.exe, which isn't unusual. But then there's a command line that looks like it's modifying the last write time of a file. The command line is using PowerShell to set the LastWriteTime to 01\/01\/1970, which is a common tactic to hide files by making them appear old. That seems suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple image loads for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate, but when combined with other activities, they might indicate something. Then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's often used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces. The file name has a PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be a red herring, but the create and delete in quick succession is a flag.\n\nAlso, there's a Pipe Created event, which could be normal, but combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger operation. The user is using PowerShell for file manipulation and possibly executing scripts. The fact that the script is modifying timestamps and using .NET components could be part of an attempt to evade detection.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these are legitimate. For example, the Temp file creation and deletion could be part of a legitimate process, like a script that's testing permissions. But the modification of the file's timestamp is less common. Also, the use of multiple registry events and image loads might be part of a larger attack, like establishing persistence or executing code.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the combination of PowerShell modifying file timestamps, creating and deleting files in Temp, along with loading various DLLs, might indicate a potential security incident. However, I need to be cautious because some of these actions could be legitimate. The confidence level is moderate, maybe around 0.65. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the suspicious activities are present and warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes performing suspicious activities including file timestamp modification, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET DLLs, which may indicate script-based attacks or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about PowerShell processes running commands that modify the LastWriteTime of files to a specific date, which is 01\/01\/1970. That's the Unix epoch, so maybe someone is trying to hide the actual modification time of these files. That could be a red flag because changing timestamps is often done to obscure when files were accessed or modified, which might be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the paths mentioned, they seem to be in various directories with names like \"modulo_logico\", \"componente_padrao\", etc. These might be part of a software structure, but the fact that multiple files across different paths are being modified could indicate a pattern. Also, the use of \"..\\\" in the file paths suggests that the script is navigating up directories, which might be trying to access files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications.\n\nThen there are some other processes like calc.exe and svchost.exe, but those are common and not necessarily malicious. The ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll are also normal, as those are standard Windows components. However, the repeated Registry value set events from svchost.exe might be normal too, depending on the context.\n\nBut the key points here are the PowerShell commands modifying file timestamps. This behavior is suspicious because it's not typical for legitimate processes to change timestamps in this way. It could be part of an attempt to cover tracks after modifying files, or even part of a data exfiltration or tampering attack. The fact that there are multiple such events across different files increases the likelihood that this is intentional and not a one-off mistake.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.8 because while the presence of these commands is a strong indicator, without more context like network activity or other malicious behavior, it's not 100% certain. However, the pattern of modifying timestamps on multiple files using PowerShell is enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file LastWriteTime attributes to Unix epoch (01\/01\/1970 00:00:00), a technique often used to obscure file modification times during data tampering or evasion.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The possible classifications are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events to see what's going on. The logs mention various processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The winlog entries include tasks like Registry value set, Process accessed, Pipe Created, and Image loaded. The files mentioned are mostly None, except for a couple where files are created, like a .yml.new file and a text file.\n\nNow, thinking about what might be suspicious. Normally, Chrome.exe doing a lot of registry changes might be a red flag, but maybe it's just normal behavior. However, looking at the ImageLoad events, there's a mention of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are part of Windows Defender, so loading them might be normal. But wait, if Chrome is loading these DLLs, is that expected? Maybe not. Also, the fact that there are multiple registry value sets from chrome.exe could indicate something like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's normal if it's part of a monitoring setup. However, the filename is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which could be a configuration file being written. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThe PowerShell.exe processes are also present. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. But in this case, the only event related to PowerShell is a file creation of \"unidade_logico.txt\" â€“ which might just be a text file. Not obviously malicious, but could be part of something else.\n\nLooking at the frequency of events: Chrome.exe has a lot of Registry value set events. If that's normal for Chrome, then maybe not interesting. But if it's unusual, that could be a sign. Also, the fact that there's a mix of different processes and events might indicate some activity that's worth looking into.\n\nHowever, there's no explicit evidence of malicious activity here. No obvious command-line arguments, no network connections, no unusual file paths. The events could be part of normal operations, like software updates or configuration changes. But the high number of registry changes by Chrome might still be a point of interest.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. The presence of multiple registry changes and image loads might be benign, but in a real-world scenario, an analyst might flag this for further inspection. So maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because of the unusual activity, even if not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances performing repeated registry modifications, combined with image loads of Windows Defender DLLs and file creation by winlogbeat.exe, suggest potential system manipulation or monitoring activity warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
