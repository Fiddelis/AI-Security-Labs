{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to analyze these system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The events mention \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set,\" which might be normal, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they could indicate something bad.\n\nThen there's the WMIC.exe process loading several DLLs. The files mentioned are urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, which are part of Windows' built-in components. However, the paths for some of the DLLs are in the Windows Defender directory. Loading these DLLs might be normal, but if an attacker is using WMIC to execute commands, that could be a red flag. Also, the command line for one of the cmd.exe processes is \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process call create notepad.exe,\" which is a common technique used in attacks to spawn processes in a way that can bypass detection.\n\nAnother thing is the creation of a file named \"objeto_temporario.txt\" by PowerShell. The name translates to \"temporary object\" in Portuguese, which might be a red herring, but creating files in user directories can sometimes be part of data exfiltration or temporary storage for malicious activities. There's also a winlogbeat file being created, which is a log shipper, but if it's being used in an unexpected way, that might be relevant.\n\nLooking at the frequency of events, there are multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe being accessed and creating processes. The combination of these events, especially the use of WMIC to load DLLs and create processes, along with the creation of files, might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code or bypass security measures. The presence of Registry value set events could be part of modifying system settings or disabling security features.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is widely used in administrative tasks, and creating temporary files is normal. But the repetition of certain events and the specific DLLs loaded might be more suspicious. The confidence here is a bit tricky. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not enough to be certain it's malicious without more context. So, I think the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75 because there are multiple indicators that could be part of an attack, but they might also have legitimate explanations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: frequent PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage, WMIC loading of potentially malicious DLLs (e.g., amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), and file creation in user directories. These patterns align with common attack techniques for process injection and persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
