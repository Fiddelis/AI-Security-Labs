The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look at all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first entry: 'whoami.exe' is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. That's typical, not suspicious. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. The command line for one of them is a findstr and select-string command looking for 'password' in various file types. That seems like a search for sensitive information, which could be a red flag. \n\nNext, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events with paths to .NET DLLs and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading .NET assemblies is common for PowerShell, but the repeated loading of specific DLLs might be part of a legitimate process. However, the presence of Windows Defender's DLL could indicate some interaction with the antivirus, maybe trying to bypass it?\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's often a tactic used by malware to execute scripts temporarily without leaving traces. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which might be a legitimate script, but combined with the other actions, it's suspicious.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' events are a bit vague. They might be related to PowerShell's execution policy or other provider activities. However, the repeated entries could indicate something trying to manipulate the environment.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of searching for passwords in files, loading specific DLLs, creating and deleting a temporary script file, and multiple PowerShell activities might suggest an attempt to gather sensitive information or execute malicious scripts. However, some of these actions could be part of normal administrative tasks. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious code, but the pattern of activities is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing password search commands across files, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, and loading .NET assemblies may indicate credential harvesting or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. The first event has a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' and 'password' in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to find credentials or sensitive information. The same command line appears again later, which might indicate repeated attempts.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe that's normal, but not necessarily suspicious. Notepad and calc.exe are common, but the image loaded events for urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll don't stand out immediately. However, the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords could be a red flag. \n\nOther events involve svchost.exe and registry changes, which can be normal system behavior. The OfficeClickToRun.exe doing a DNS query might be part of updates. But the key point here is the multiple instances of PowerShell trying to find passwords in files. That could be part of a credential harvesting attack. \n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The file created by PowerShell in the AppData folder might be a temporary file, but not necessarily malicious. However, combining that with the search for passwords, it's possible that an attacker is trying to extract sensitive data. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit medium because while the PowerShell commands are suspicious, they could be part of a legitimate script. But the repetition and the focus on password-related terms make it more likely to be malicious.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them are related to chrome.exe performing various tasks like setting registry values, making DNS queries, and network connections. There are also a couple of entries about files being created, like winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file and powershell.exe creating a text file. \n\nNow, the key here is to see if there's any suspicious activity. Chrome.exe doing registry changes and DNS queries might be normal, but if it's doing a lot of them, maybe that's a red flag. However, looking at the entries, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing these actions, but not sure if that's abnormal. \n\nWait, there's an entry where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. But maybe if they were loaded from unexpected paths? The paths here seem standard.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal. The powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads folder is also likely benign unless the file has malicious content, but the log doesn't mention that.\n\nThe last entry is a DNS query from a process that's None, which might be an error or an anomaly, but not sure. However, the rest of the logs don't show any clear signs of malware or attacks. There's no mention of failed logins, unauthorized access, or unusual network traffic beyond normal DNS and network connections.\n\nConsidering all that, the majority of events are normal activities. The repetition of chrome.exe's actions might be part of regular operations, like updating settings or browsing. Without more context or additional suspicious events, these logs don't seem to indicate a security threat. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily show normal chrome.exe operations (registry changes, DNS queries, network connections) and benign file creation by legitimate processes (winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe).

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. That's a log shipper, so maybe it's just normal operation. But then there's another entry where powershell.exe creates a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is yet. Then there's some entries with 'None' values, which might be placeholders or errors, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen I see multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The next entry is cmd.exe running a command to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks could be part of cleanup, but if it's part of a larger attack, that might be concerning. \n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being used to delete tasks, which is normal, but combined with other activities... Also, there are image loads of taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate file, so that's probably okay. \n\nI notice that whoami.exe is executed a couple of times. That's just getting user info, which is normal. But the repeated access to processes and registry changes might indicate something. \n\nWait, the user is using multiple scheduled task deletions. Maybe they're trying to remove traces of their activities. Also, the presence of a .yml.new file for winlogbeat might be a configuration change, but not sure. \n\nBut looking at the overall picture, there's a lot of process accesses and registry changes, but nothing that clearly points to a malicious payload. The main suspicious parts are the scheduled task deletions and the file creations. However, without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected file paths, it's hard to be certain. \n\nHmm, the confidence might be around 0.6. There's some suspicious activity, but not enough to be certain. The justification would be the multiple process accesses, registry changes, and task deletions that could indicate cleanup or malicious activity.

Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a cmd.exe running a command that uses wmic to delete processes named notepad.exe. That seems suspicious because deleting processes isn't normal. Then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing the registry. The WMIC.exe entries are also noteworthy. They have command lines that delete notepad.exe processes again, and they load some DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is related to anti-malware, so loading that might be an attempt to disable it. Also, there's a command to delete a user named \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and another user deletion with net.exe. That's a red flag because deleting user accounts can be part of a privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a mix of legitimate tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and net.exe, but the commands they're running are malicious. The use of WMIC to delete processes and the registry modifications could indicate someone trying to hide their activities. Also, the presence of multiple registry value sets might be trying to modify system settings or disable security features. The fact that they're using both cmd and powershell suggests a multi-stage attack. \n\nBut wait, some of these might be false positives. For example, whoami.exe is a legitimate tool, but in this case, it's being used in a context that might be part of a larger malicious activity. However, the combination of process deletions, user account removals, and loading specific DLLs points towards a potential security incident.

That's common, but sometimes they can be used for malicious purposes. Let me check the commands. There's a line where cmd.exe is used with \"net user ... \/del \/domain\". Deleting user accounts in a domain might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be suspicious. Also, there's a command to delete a service with \"sc delete win32times\". Deleting services isn't always bad, but if it's a critical service or done without authorization, that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about registry value sets and process accesses. The registry events could indicate changes to system settings, which might be part of a compromise. The fact that PowerShell is being accessed multiple times might suggest it's being used to execute scripts or commands. Also, the presence of 'conhost.exe' and 'services.exe' in registry events might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nI need to check for any patterns. There are several instances of 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events. The deletion of user accounts and services might be part of an attempt to remove traces or take control. Also, the use of 'whoami.exe' could be to check the current user context, which is a common step in privilege escalation.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be legitimate. For example, administrators might delete users or services as part of normal operations. But the combination of multiple user deletions, service deletions, and registry changes could indicate a more malicious intent. The repetition of certain commands and the involvement of PowerShell and cmd.exe in critical operations are concerning.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. The presence of multiple suspicious activities, even if some could be legitimate, when combined, increases the likelihood of a security incident. Therefore, classifying this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75 seems appropriate. There's enough to warrant further investigation but not definitive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of domain user accounts via 'net user \/del \/domain', service deletion ('sc delete win32times'), frequent registry modifications, and repeated process access events involving PowerShell and cmd.exe.

Let's go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate Windows command, but it's often used by attackers to check user context. Then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are common but can be abused for malicious purposes. The entries show multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and processes created. \n\nOne of the cmd.exe entries has a command line that deletes temporary files. The command line is \"cmd.exe \/c del %temp%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt >nul 2>&1 & del %temp%\\\\estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe >nul 2>&1\". That looks suspicious because it's deleting files, which might be part of cleaning up after some activity. Also, the filenames have \"calc\" in them, which could be a red herring or part of a naming convention used by malware.\n\nThen there are several entries where powershell.exe is involved with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be normal, but the repetition could indicate something automated. Also, there are Image Load events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are .NET framework components, which are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a sign of something malicious, like a .NET-based payload.\n\nAnother thing to note is the multiple Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. The fact that both powershell.exe and cmd.exe are involved in these events might indicate attempts to modify system settings.\n\nHowever, there's also the use of whoami.exe, which is normal, and some of the events might just be part of regular system operations. But the combination of file deletions, registry modifications, and the loading of .NET DLLs could point to an attacker trying to execute a script or payload that's cleaning up traces and modifying the system.\n\nThe confidence level is a bit tricky. There are some suspicious activities, but without more context, like network connections or unexpected binaries, it's hard to be 100% certain.

There are also a few instances of whoami.exe and winlogbeat.exe. \n\nFirst, the Image loaded events point to system files like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. Those are legitimate, but the fact that PowerShell is loading them might be normal. However, there's also a file from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll, which is also a legitimate file. \n\nThen there's a File created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The file name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. The presence of \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" might be part of a legitimate script testing, but combined with the quick deletion, it's suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple Process accessed events for PowerShell, which could indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. \n\nThe whoami.exe commands are normal; they just display user information. The winlogbeat.exe event is about a file creation in the Downloads directory, which might be part of installing or configuring a log agent, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the combination of events, the most suspicious part is the creation and deletion of the Temp file. It's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts temporarily and then remove evidence. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious code here. The other events don't show obvious signs of compromise. \n\nBut since the batch includes a file that's created and then deleted, which is a potential indicator of something trying to hide its tracks, this might warrant further investigation. However, it's not conclusive. The confidence here would be moderate because while the action is suspicious, it could also be a benign process. \n\nI need to check if there are any other anomalies. The repeated Process accessed events might be normal if the system is under monitoring. The presence of multiple PowerShell events could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. \n\nConsidering all that, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of file creation and deletion in Temp, along with multiple process accesses, could indicate a potential security incident.

The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool that displays the current user's identity, so that's normal. But the fact that it's being executed multiple times might not be suspicious on its own. However, the 'powershell.exe' entries are more concerning. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so seeing it multiple times, especially with 'Process accessed' events, could indicate something. But wait, the 'Process accessed' rule might just be monitoring access, not necessarily malicious activity.\n\nThen there are some 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll', which is part of Internet Explorer and used for URL monikers. But that's a standard system file, so loading it from System32 isn't unusual. However, if it's being loaded in an unexpected context, that could be a red flag. But in the data provided, it's just listed as part of the process, so maybe not enough to flag yet.\n\nThere's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating a configuration file, that's normal during setup. The file path seems legitimate, so that might not be an issue.\n\nLooking at the registry events, several processes are setting registry values. 'svchost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and 'Calculator.exe' are involved. 'svchost.exe' is a standard Windows process, but if it's modifying registry keys that are not typical, that could be a problem. However, the events here just mention 'Registry value set' without details on which keys, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Chrome browser has several DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries are normal for browsing, but if they're going to suspicious domains, that's a problem. But the data doesn't specify the domains, so again, not enough info.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has a lot of legitimate processes and events. The repeated PowerShell accesses might be worth looking into, but without more context like command-line arguments or unusual network activity, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The 'whoami.exe' and 'urlmon.dll' are standard. The winlogbeat file creation seems normal. The registry changes are from known processes but lack specific details.
