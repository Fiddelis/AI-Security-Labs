{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several entries related to PowerShell and cmd.exe, which are often used in malicious activities. One event stands out: the cmd.exe process has a command line that creates a scheduled task with the command \"powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The file path mentioned here is non-existent, which might be a red flag. Typically, attackers might try to execute scripts from non-existent paths to evade detection, or maybe it's a typo. But the fact that they're creating a scheduled task under the system account with daily execution is suspicious.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a file in the Tasks directory named \"win32times\", which could be related to the scheduled task. Also, there's a schtasks.exe process creating a task with the same name. The use of \"-ep bypass\" in PowerShell is a known method to bypass execution policies, which is often used in attacks. \n\nHowever, there are also entries about Chrome and svchost.exe making registry changes. But those might be normal if the user is doing some legitimate activities. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file could be part of log management, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nBut the key points here are the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges (system account), the use of PowerShell with bypassed execution policies, and the non-existent script path. These are indicators of potential malicious behavior. Even though some entries might be benign, the combination of these events suggests an attempt to establish persistence on the system. \n\nI need to check if all these events are part of a legitimate process. For example, creating scheduled tasks is a normal action, but doing so with system-level permissions and using PowerShell to execute a non-existent script is suspicious. Also, multiple registry changes might indicate configuration changes that could be part of an attack. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch does show signs of potential malicious activity. The confidence level would be around 0.8 because while some events are normal, the combination of scheduled task creation, PowerShell bypass, and non-existent files points to an investigation-worthy scenario.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity: scheduled task creation with PowerShell bypass (-ep bypass), non-existent script paths, and repeated registry modifications. These are common indicators of attempted persistence and execution in attack chains.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a normal activity, maybe part of installation or configuration. Not suspicious yet.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe created a file named entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is common, but creating a text file might be normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe accessed a process. Process access can be normal, but maybe if it's accessing something unusual. However, the file path is None here, so maybe it's just a process access without a specific file involved.\n\nFourth event: whoami.exe was executed. That's a standard command to check user identity. Usually benign, but if it's part of a larger attack, maybe. But alone, not suspicious.\n\nFifth event: another process access by powershell.exe. Again, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nLooking at all together: Multiple PowerShell activities and a file creation. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity. The files created are in typical locations (Downloads), and the processes are standard. No unusual network activity, no access to sensitive files, no signs of privilege escalation. \n\nBut wait, the presence of multiple PowerShell events might be a red flag. However, without more context like command-line arguments or unusual behavior, it's hard to say. The user might be doing legitimate tasks. \n\nConsidering all, the events don't show clear malicious intent. Maybe just normal user activities. So classification would be NOT INTERESTING. Confidence around 0.4 since there's some PowerShell activity but nothing concrete.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard user activities (file creation via PowerShell and whoami.exe execution) without indicators of compromise, suspicious file paths, or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
