{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command-line tool, but it's often used in attacks to get user info. However, just running whoami isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that looks suspicious. Let me check that command line again. The code seems to be doing some XOR encryption on a string, then sending it via a web request to example.com. That's odd because it's obfuscating data and sending it over the network. The use of XOR encryption might be an attempt to hide the payload. Also, the fact that it's using Invoke-WebRequest to send the data could be part of exfiltrating information.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, loading various .dll files. Some of these are legitimate .NET assemblies, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a red flag. However, Windows Defender's files are usually legitimate. But the combination with the obfuscated PowerShell script could indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there's a File Create and File Delete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then immediately deleting a file might be an attempt to avoid leaving evidence. The filename has \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which could be a misdirection, but the fact that it's in the Temp directory and deleted quickly is suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the normal browser activity isn't concerning, but the PowerShell events with obfuscated code, network exfiltration, and the file creation\/deletion pattern are signs of potential malicious activity. The use of XOR encryption and the network POST to example.com suggests data exfiltration. Even though some files are legitimate, the overall pattern is more indicative of a security incident. So, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit obfuscated command-line activity involving XOR encryption and network exfiltration to example.com, combined with suspicious file creation\/deletion patterns in temporary directories.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one mentions a pipe created by powershell.exe, which might be normal, but then there are multiple entries with the same command line. The command line is using PowerShell to encode some text with XOR and then sending it via a web request to example.com. That seems suspicious because XOR encoding is often used to obfuscate data, which is a common tactic in malware. The repeated entries might indicate that the process is being executed multiple times, perhaps to exfiltrate data. Also, the use of Invoke-WebRequest to send the data to a remote server is a red flag. Since all the events are related to PowerShell doing this, it's likely a malicious activity.

First, I'll scan through each event to spot any suspicious activity.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell command that's doing some XOR encryption on a string that includes \"Path\\n----\\nC:\\Users\\victim\". Then it sends the encrypted data to example.com. That seems fishy because encrypting user paths and sending them to a remote server could be data exfiltration. \n\nLooking further, there's another PowerShell event with the same command line, which reinforces that this isn't a one-off. The other events involve image loads like urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer, but that's normal. However, the repeated PowerShell activities, especially the one with the XOR encryption and POST request, stand out. \n\nI also see file creations related to winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe the attacker is trying to set up a data exfiltration channel. The registry events and process accesses are common, but the key thing here is the encrypted data being sent to example.com. \n\nThe confidence here is medium to high.

So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are all setting registry values. Some of these processes are normal, like Calculator.exe, but others like svchost.exe can be part of legitimate system processes. However, multiple registry changes might be a red flag, especially if they're from unexpected sources.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe. There are a bunch of events here. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry a lot, so seeing multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe could be unusual. Also, there's an Image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are security-related DLLs. If they're being loaded by chrome.exe, that might be normal, but maybe not. I should check if there's any indication of tampering here.\n\nNext, there's a file created event for winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of an installation or setup. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which could be suspicious if it's not expected. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe events again. There are multiple Process accessed and Registry value set events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. One of the command lines shows a Remove-Item command with a long path that includes \"pacote_padrao_script.bat\". The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore might be an attempt to delete files without errors, which could be part of cleaning up after an attack. That seems suspicious.\n\nAnother event has powershell.exe creating a process with a command line that includes removing a file. The path has some unusual directory structures, like \"objeto_temporario\" and \"registro_auxiliar\", which might be obfuscated or part of a malicious script. The use of Remove-Item with those parameters could indicate an attempt to delete evidence.\n\nAlso, the Image loaded event for mscoree.dll. While mscoree is part of the .NET runtime, if it's being loaded in an unexpected context, that might be a sign of something malicious. However, without more info, it's hard to be certain.\n\nPutting it all together: there are several events involving powershell.exe doing potentially malicious actions, like deleting files with specific paths. The chrome.exe events modifying the registry multiple times could be part of a larger attack. The presence of multiple registry changes and file operations might indicate an attempt to compromise the system. However, some of these events could be benign, like normal system operations. But the combination of these events, especially the PowerShell commands and the registry modifications, raises a red flag.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading image files like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others from the Windows .NET Framework directory. These are legitimate system files, so that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Downloads folder, 'estrutura_temporario.txt'â€”maybe that's benign, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several events from 'chrome.exe' with registry value sets. Chrome updating its registry is normal, but a lot of them might be a red flag. However, the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. \n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a name that looks like a PowerShell script: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1'. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there are multiple 'Remove-Item' commands with paths that have '..' in them. That could indicate navigating up directories, which might be part of a script trying to delete files in parent directories. The use of '-Force' and '-ErrorAction Ignore' suggests the script is trying to delete files without prompting and ignoring errors, which is typical in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this together: the PowerShell process is creating and then deleting temporary script files, and the command lines show deletion commands with suspicious paths. Even though some events are normal (like loading .NET DLLs and Chrome registry changes), the combination of file creation\/deletion and the use of 'Remove-Item' with force and error suppression points to potential malicious behavior.

Let's start by scanning through each entry.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. The command lines involve removing files using Remove-Item with paths that have '..' in them. That might be a red flag because using '..' could indicate moving up directories, possibly trying to delete files outside the intended directory. The -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore parameters are also concerning because they suppress errors, which attackers often do to avoid detection.\n\nThen there's the 'cmd.exe' process that's stopping and deleting services with sc.exe. That's another suspicious activity. Stopping and deleting services can be part of a larger attack, like trying to disable security software or other services to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several registry value set events, which might be part of configuring persistence or modifying system settings. Also, the 'whoami.exe' being run could be to check the current user context, which is common in reconnaissance.\n\nI also see a 'conhost.exe' process, which is usually a Windows console host. However, if it's involved in unexpected activities, that could be a sign of something malicious. But in this case, the events related to conhost.exe are just registry changes, which might be normal or could be part of a larger scheme.\n\nThe 'services.exe' events are about registry changes, which might be normal, but combined with the other activities, it's worth looking into. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands trying to delete files and the use of sc.exe to manipulate services suggests an attempt to remove evidence or disable security measures.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign activity here. For example, the 'MpClient.dll' file is part of Windows Defender, so the ImageLoaded event might be normal. The 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' file creation could be part of PowerShell's normal operation.\n\nBut putting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell commands deleting files with suspicious paths, using sc.exe to stop and delete services, and numerous registry modifications points towards a potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because these actions are commonly seen in attack scenarios, like cleaning up after an exploit or evading detection.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Remove-Item' commands with '..' directory traversal, combined with sc.exe service manipulation and registry modifications, suggests potential malicious activity to evade detection or persist.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines representing system events. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are multiple entries involving powershell.exe, which is often used in both legitimate and malicious activities. The tasks mentioned include ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, and ImageLoad. The ImageLoad events are pointing to various DLLs, some of which are part of .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but then there's one that's a bit odd: \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll\". Wait, Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is a legitimate file, but sometimes malware might mimic or use similar names. However, I need to check if that's a red flag here.\n\nLooking further, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1\" and then immediately a FileDelete event for the same file. That could be part of a script execution that's being cleaned up. PowerShell scripts in temporary directories are common, but if the script is being created and deleted quickly, it might be an attempt to avoid detection. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like a test or a legitimate script. But the presence of such files could still be suspicious if there's no clear reason for them.\n\nAlso, there's a command line entry for cmd.exe that deletes a file in the Temp directory. That's a bit unusual because deleting a file might be part of a cleanup, but combined with other PowerShell activities, it could be part of a larger operation. However, the command line is using a common technique with \"del \/A:H\" which deletes hidden files. Not sure if that's malicious on its own.\n\nThe repeated access to PowerShell and registry changes might indicate some form of configuration or persistence mechanism. However, without more context, like unusual registry keys or unexpected processes, it's hard to say. The ImageLoad events are all for legitimate system DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell operations.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch has some suspicious elements like the temporary script file being created and deleted, but those could be part of normal operations. The presence of Windows Defender's DLL is legitimate. The cmd.exe command is a bit odd but not necessarily malicious. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities with registry changes and file operations might be worth investigating further. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous.

Then there are several entries about powershell.exe with tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. Those might be part of normal operations, but the repetition could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems legitimate. Then, a file created in the AppData folder for PowerShell's startup profile. That's a common place for configurations, so maybe okay. However, there are multiple registry value set events, which could be benign but might also indicate changes to system settings.\n\nThe cmd.exe process is deleting a file in the Temp directory. Deleting temp files is normal, but the command line uses a wildcard and the \/f \/q \/s flags, which are forceful and quiet, possibly hiding the deletion. The presence of whoami.exe is standard for checking user context, but repeated process accesses and registry changes might be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, while some activities are normal, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, registry modifications, and file deletions could indicate an attempt to modify system behavior or clean up after malicious activities.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. The main task is to look at all of them together and decide if there's something suspicious here.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. A lot of them involve PowerShell.exe, which is normal, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the specific tasks and files mentioned.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there's a File created event with a path in the Downloads folder, which might be benign. Then there are multiple entries with the command line \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore\". This command is trying to delete a file named key.log in the temporary directory. The fact that it's being called multiple times might be a red flag. Why would someone repeatedly try to delete a file? Maybe they're trying to remove evidence, or perhaps the file is part of a malicious process.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events pointing to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But the repeated Image Loads could be part of a larger process, maybe a malicious one that's loading multiple components.\n\nAnother point is the Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be normal, but sometimes attackers use named pipes for inter-process communication. However, alone it's not conclusive.\n\nThe File Delete event for a temporary script file could be part of a cleanup process. But the fact that the script was created and then deleted might indicate that it was used for something, like executing a command and then removing the trace.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together: the most suspicious part is the repeated attempts to delete key.log in the TEMP directory. This could be an indicator of an attacker trying to clean up after themselves. However, it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate process. But when combined with other events like file creation and registry changes, it might be more suspicious.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's a clear pattern. The command line is the same in multiple entries, which might indicate that the same script is being run multiple times. Also, the fact that the script is trying to remove a specific file could be a sign of an attempt to delete logs or other evidence.\n\nBut I should also consider that some of these events might be benign. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and deleting temporary files is normal. However, the combination of these events, especially the repeated deletion attempts and the creation of a temporary script file, might be more indicative of something malicious.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple Image Load events for .NET components could be part of a PowerShell script that's using .NET to perform actions. But again, this is normal in many scenarios.\n\nI think the key points here are the repeated deletion of key.log and the creation and deletion of a temporary script. These could be signs of an attacker trying to execute a script and then remove traces. However, without more context like unusual registry changes or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering the confidence, I'd say there's a moderate chance this is interesting. The events are not overtly malicious, but the pattern of deletion and temporary file handling might be worth investigating further. So I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events exhibit patterns that warrant investigation, though they are not definitively malicious. Key indicators include:\n\n1. **Repeated Deletion of `key.log` in Temp Directory**:  \n   The command `Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore` appears multiple times. While this could be part of a legitimate cleanup process, repeated attempts to delete a specific file may indicate an effort to remove evidence of activity (e.g., logs from a script or malicious payload).\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion**:  \n   A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1`) is created in the Temp directory and subsequently deleted. This pattern is common in both benign and malicious contexts (e.g., script execution followed by cleanup). However, the lack of visibility into the script's contents raises concerns.\n\n3. **Registry and Pipe Events**:  \n   Registry modifications and a \"Pipe Created\" event could be part of persistence mechanisms or inter-process communication. While these are not inherently malicious, they warrant further scrutiny in the context of other suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **.NET Assembly Loads**:  \n   Multiple Image Load events for legitimate .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are normal for PowerShell operations. However, when combined with other anomalies, they may suggest the use of .NET for obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe repeated deletion attempts, temporary script handling, and associated events suggest potential malicious activity (e.g., cleanup after exploitation or evasion). However, these actions could also be part of legitimate processes. Further analysis (e.g., inspecting the script's contents, correlating with network activity, or checking for persistence mechanisms) is necessary to confirm.  \n\n**Classification**: `INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence**: 0.7 (moderate risk, requires deeper investigation)."}

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each event.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell is trying to remove a file named key.log from the TEMP directory. The command line shows \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore\". That's suspicious because deleting a log file might be an attempt to cover tracks. But maybe it's a legitimate cleanup? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably not malicious. Then, a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's part of PowerShell's normal operations, maybe saving settings. Not too concerning.\n\nThen, several registry value set events and process accessed events. PowerShell accessing its own processes might be normal, but multiple registry changes could be a red flag. The whoami.exe process is run, which is a standard tool to check user context. That's normal.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events again, they're all .NET framework DLLs and Windows Defender components. These are legitimate, so probably not malicious. However, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script test file. Creating and deleting it quickly might be part of a script testing, but could also be an attempt to execute and then remove evidence.\n\nAnother event is a pipe created, which is used for inter-process communication. Not inherently malicious, but if combined with other events, might be part of something more.\n\nNow, the first event's deletion of key.log is the only one that stands out. If that file was created earlier and then deleted, it might be an attempt to erase logs. But in the given logs, there's no mention of key.log being created before. The other events involve PowerShell doing normal operations, loading legitimate DLLs, and temporary files. \n\nHowever, the repeated registry changes and process accesses might indicate some level of activity that's not standard. But without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. The confidence here is a bit low because the majority of events are normal, but the deletion of key.log and the temp file creation\/deletion could be signs of something. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there are a few suspicious actions like deleting a log file and temporary script files, even though other events are normal. The justification would be the deletion of key.log and the temp file, which could be cover-up attempts.

The command line is 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems a bit odd. Usually, PowerShell scripts might have more specific commands. But maybe that's just a placeholder or a red herring. Also, some of the winlog tasks mention 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be normal system events, but I should check if they're associated with anything suspicious.\n\nThen, there's an entry where a file is created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. Hmm, StartupProfileData... that might be related to PowerShell profiles. If someone is creating a startup profile, maybe they're trying to execute code automatically when PowerShell starts. That could be a sign of persistence, which is a red flag.\n\nAnother event shows a registry value set by PowerShell. Changing registry values can be part of configuring the system, but if done by an attacker, it might be to modify system behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same goes for the 'Process accessed' events. Those might just be normal monitoring, but repeated access could indicate something.\n\nThen there's 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times. That's a simple command to get the current user, which is common in scripts. But if it's run repeatedly, maybe it's part of a larger attack, like enumerating users or checking privileges. However, alone, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the file 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender, that's a legitimate file. But if it's being loaded in a suspicious way, maybe there's a problem. However, the event here just mentions it being loaded, which might be normal.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation. But if this is unexpected, it could be an indicator of someone trying to set up data exfiltration.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell executions, some file and registry changes, and the use of whoami. However, none of these events are highly suspicious on their own. The repetition of events might indicate some automated process, but without more context like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The presence of legitimate processes and files makes me think that while there's some activity, it might not be worth investigating unless there's a known threat or additional context.

That's common, but when it's used repeatedly, especially with ProcessAccess events, it might be a red flag. But wait, there are also instances of whoami.exe being created. Whoami is a standard tool that shows the current user's identity, so that's normal. But why is it being created multiple times? Maybe the user is just running it for legitimate purposes, but if it's part of a script or automation, that's okay.\n\nNow, there's one event where winlogbeat.exe created a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. But the path mentioned is in the Downloads directory, which isn't unusual. However, the presence of a .new file suggests it's a temporary file being written, which could be normal during setup.\n\nBut wait, the majority of the events are about powershell.exe being accessed. ProcessAccess events usually indicate that a process is being monitored or accessed by another process. If this is happening multiple times, maybe there's some suspicious activity. However, without more context like command-line arguments or unusual behavior, it's hard to tell. Powershell is often used by attackers for executing commands, but it's also a standard tool.\n\nThe registry event where a value is set by powershell.exe could be part of a legitimate configuration change, but again, without knowing what the value is, it's hard to say. The justification here is that while there are multiple ProcessAccess events and some file creation, none of the events clearly indicate a security threat. The whoami.exe executions are normal, and the winlogbeat activity seems legitimate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The confidence is medium because the high number of powershell events might be concerning, but without more data, it's not conclusive. Therefore, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated PowerShell process access and standard 'whoami.exe' executions, which are common in normal system operations. No clear indicators of compromise, malicious file activity, or anomalous behavior are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
