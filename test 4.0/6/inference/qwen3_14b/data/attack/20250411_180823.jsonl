{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be okay, but notepad.exe modifying the registry is a bit odd. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious tasks. Then, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected place or in an unusual context, that could be a red flag. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the standard location, so maybe that's fine.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line includes creating tasks named \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\" that run calc.exe. Creating scheduled tasks on logon and startup could be suspicious, especially if they're executing calc.exe, which is a simple calculator. But why would someone create a scheduled task to run calc.exe? That doesn't seem normal. Also, the command line uses schtasks to create these tasks, which is a legitimate tool, but the names of the tasks are in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or indicate something else.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating another task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same command. This seems like a pattern. Then there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon. Scheduled tasks are usually stored in the Tasks folder, so that path is correct, but the presence of multiple tasks with similar naming patterns might be suspicious. \n\nAlso, multiple svchost.exe processes modifying the registry. Svchost is a host process for Windows services, and while it's normal for it to interact with the registry, multiple instances doing this could indicate something is wrong, especially if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the main red flags are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe, which is unusual. The use of schtasks.exe with these specific task names and the creation of tasks in the system's task directory might be part of a larger scheme. Additionally, the repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes could indicate that the system is being manipulated. Even though some of the activities are normal (like chrome.exe's network activity), the combination of these events points to potential malicious behavior, such as setting up persistence through scheduled tasks. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with unusual names executing calc.exe, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, and PowerShell process access. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanisms or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about registry value sets, which is common for normal system operations. But then I notice a few file creation events. The first one is a file created in the Windows Tasks directory: C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup. That path is under System32\\Tasks, which is a common place for scheduled tasks. If a malicious actor creates a task here, it could be a sign of persistence. The filename \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\" doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows file, so that's a red flag.\n\nAnother file created is in the user's Downloads directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems like a legitimate file for Winlogbeat configuration, but the presence of a new YAML file might be part of normal setup. However, the user might be configuring a tool, which isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\unidade_ativo.txt. A text file in Downloads is pretty normal, but depending on context, it could be part of an attack. However, without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nLooking at the processes involved: svchost.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe. These are all legitimate processes, but they can be exploited. The fact that chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll might be normal, as those are part of Windows Defender. But if there's any unusual activity with those, it could be a problem. However, the logs don't show any errors or anomalies here.\n\nThe key suspicious event is the creation of the task in System32\\Tasks. That's a high-risk area. Even if it's a legitimate task, the presence of a new task without prior knowledge could be a sign of compromise. The other file creations are less suspicious, but combined with the task creation, it might indicate someone trying to set up persistence.\n\nI should also check if there are multiple events from the same process. The svchost.exe and chrome.exe have multiple registry changes, but that's common. However, the task creation is a single event. \n\nConsidering all this, the main red flag is the file created in the System32\\Tasks directory. That's a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The other events don't seem as concerning. So, I'd classify this as interesting with medium to high confidence. The justification would be the suspicious file in the tasks folder, which could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, combined with a suspicious file created in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup), which is a common indicator of malicious persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, there are six entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Chrome modifying the registry could be normal, but doing it multiple times might be suspicious. However, I know that Chrome sometimes updates its own settings in the registry, so maybe that's just regular behavior. But repeating the same event six times might indicate something else, like a loop or an attempt to modify multiple registry keys quickly.\n\nThen there's an entry with powershell.exe and the task \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activities, but it's also a common legitimate tool. The fact that it's accessed here might not be enough on its own. The next entry is whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get the current user's identity. That's usually benign unless used in a suspicious context. The command line shows it's running from the system32 directory, which is normal.\n\nAnother powershell.exe entry with the same ProcessAccess task. So, two instances of PowerShell being accessed. Now, considering all these events together: multiple registry changes by Chrome, which might be normal, but combined with PowerShell activity. However, there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unusual file access, network connections, or other red flags. The whoami.exe is just a standard command. \n\nBut wait, the repetition of the same event (Chrome modifying registry) six times could be a sign of something automated or malicious. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or other processes involved, it's hard to say. The PowerShell events might be part of normal system operations. Since there's no explicit malicious activity detected in the logs provided, maybe this isn't interesting. However, the repeated Chrome events might warrant further investigation. But the classification depends on whether there's a clear threat. Since the justification needs to be concise, maybe the answer is not interesting because there's no clear malicious pattern here. But I'm a bit unsure. Maybe the confidence is medium. Let me check again. All events are from legitimate processes, no errors or unusual activities. So, probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe) performing normal operations (registry updates, process access). No suspicious patterns, anomalies, or indicators of compromise are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
