{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those seem normal. Chrome and svchost are common processes, and DNS queries and network connections are typical. But then I notice that chrome.exe has multiple network connections detected. Maybe that's normal, but maybe not. Let me check further.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes. PowerShell is often used for scripting, which can be benign, but sometimes malicious. The cmd.exe entries have command lines that look suspicious. For example, one of them is adding a user with a domain and a password that includes \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adding them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts with temporary passwords sounds like a potential security breach. Also, there's a command using net1.exe, which I don't recognize as a standard Windows tool. The use of net1.exe instead of net.exe might be a typo or a malicious replacement.\n\nLooking at the file creation events: winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file, and powershell.exe creating pacote_base.txt. The paths are in the Downloads directory, which is common for user files, but the presence of a .yml.new file could be part of a configuration change. However, the more concerning part is the network commands and the creation of domain admin accounts.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of \"net\" and \"net1\" commands. The command lines include adding users and groups in the domain, which could be part of an attack trying to escalate privileges. The passwords used are temporary-looking, which might indicate an attacker trying to set up access without being detected.\n\nAlso, the process \"conhost.exe\" is involved in a registry value set event. Conhost is usually related to console windows, but registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of domain admin accounts, the use of suspicious commands, and the presence of non-standard executables like net1.exe point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events is concerning. The confidence is high because creating domain admin accounts is a significant security risk, and the command lines are clearly attempting to modify user and group permissions on a domain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net' commands with temporary passwords, use of non-standard 'net1.exe' instead of 'net.exe', and repeated registry modifications. These indicate potential privilege escalation and lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage tracking, so that might be normal. But svchost.exe is a legitimate process, though sometimes malware hides there.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring logs, but creating a new config file could be part of normal operations or maybe someone configuring it. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's PowerShell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is common for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The third event is a registry change, which could be something like changing execution policies or adding new keys. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThe fourth event is PowerShell.exe having a process accessed. That might be normal, but if it's being accessed by another process, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The first event might be normal, but the combination of PowerShell activities and the file creation by winlogbeat could be part of a setup. However, there's not enough evidence here to confirm malicious intent. The confidence is low, but since there's some unusual activity, maybe it's worth looking into. So classification would be interesting but with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell.exe (registry modification and process access) alongside file creation by svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe in non-standard locations may indicate potential configuration changes or monitoring setup, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
