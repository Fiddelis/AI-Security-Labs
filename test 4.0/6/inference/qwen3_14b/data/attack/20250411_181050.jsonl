{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these events step by step. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look for any suspicious activities. The first event is chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, so probably not an issue. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but I should check the context. \n\nNext, powershell.exe being accessed is common, but maybe not suspicious alone. Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Wait, winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation, maybe during configuration. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses certutil to encode and decode files. Certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding, but when combined with commands like this, it can be part of data exfiltration or malicious payload decoding. The command line here is using calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows tool, but encoding it and then decoding it into a temporary file might be a red flag. \n\nThen there are multiple instances of certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. The File Executable Detected event for estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe might indicate that a new executable was created, which could be malicious. Also, the registry events from cmd.exe and certutil.exe might suggest changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe rundll32.exe executing PcaSvc.dll's PcaPatchSdbTask is part of Windows Update, so that's normal. However, the SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll is interesting. SDXHelper is not a standard Windows process, so if it's loading system DLLs, that might be legitimate if it's a valid application, but without more context, it's a bit suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together, the key points are the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding files, creation of temporary executables, and the presence of non-standard processes like SDXHelper. These could indicate an attacker trying to execute malicious code or exfiltrate data. However, some of these events could be benign. The confidence here is a bit moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they might not be conclusive without more context. But the combination of certutil's use and the creation of executable files in temp directories is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potential data exfiltration or payload delivery), creation of temporary executable files in user directories, and non-standard processes (SDXHelper.exe) loading system DLLs. These patterns align with common attack techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about chrome.exe doing network connections and setting registry values. That's normal behavior for Chrome, right? Like, it connects to the internet and might modify some registry settings. But then there's a few other processes. \n\nLooking at the fifth event, there's a File created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. The file is called componente_auxiliar.txt. That's a .txt file, which might be benign, but sometimes attackers use such names to hide malicious files. However, just creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. Maybe it's part of normal user activity.\n\nThen there's an entry for SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if SDXHelper.exe is loading it, maybe that's part of a legitimate application. But SDXHelper itself isn't a common process. Maybe it's a helper tool for some software, but I should check if it's legitimate. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that it's loading a DLL from System32 might be normal.\n\nAnother event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a known tool for log shipping, so that's probably legitimate. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which is common for installations.\n\nThen there are events about powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a standard tool. However, multiple ProcessAccess events could indicate someone trying to interact with other processes, which might be suspicious. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, looking for any red flags. The majority of events are from Chrome and PowerShell, which are common. The only unusual thing is the SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. But I'm not sure if that's a threat. Also, the FileCreate event for componente_auxiliar.txt might be benign. However, if there are multiple events from the same process doing unusual things, that could be a sign. \n\nWait, the SDXHelper.exe is loading a DLL from System32, which is expected. But the name SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard one. Maybe it's a typo or a malicious process. However, without more information, like if it's signed or part of a known software, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother point is the repeated Registry value sets from chrome.exe. Chrome might modify registry keys for updates or configurations, but if it's doing it excessively, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't show any specific malicious registry changes, just that they're being set.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are normal, but there are a few unusual processes (SDXHelper.exe) and some PowerShell activity. However, none of the events clearly indicate a security threat. The confidence is low, so maybe \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a note that some processes are not standard. However, the justification should be concise. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events are routine Chrome and PowerShell activity. The SDXHelper.exe and winlogbeat.exe entries are plausible for system operations, and no clear malicious patterns (e.g., lateral movement, credential theft) are evident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
