{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll note it.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Multiple times, but chrome doing registry changes could be normal, especially if it's updating settings or extensions. However, repeated registry changes might indicate something else, but I need more context.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a standard command to get user info, so probably benign. But then there's another powershell.exe process with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Oh, keystroke logging is a red flag. That script is likely capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware to steal passwords or other sensitive info.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various .NET DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell scripts, but when combined with the keystroke logging script, it's more concerning. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths (like C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\...) suggests that the attacker might be using different directories to avoid detection, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nAlso, the command lines for the PowerShell processes include executing these scripts with -LogPath pointing to the TEMP directory. Logging keystrokes to a temporary file could be part of exfiltrating data later. Even though the logs here don't show the data being sent out, the presence of such a script is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\nThe repeated registry events from chrome.exe might be unrelated, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it could indicate a multi-stage attack where different components are involved. The fact that multiple PowerShell processes are accessing and creating files, along with loading .NET assemblies, suggests that this is not just a simple user action but potentially a more complex attack.\n\nThe confidence here is high because keystroke logging is a clear sign of malicious intent. Even if some events are normal, the combination of these activities points to a possible security incident that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts (e.g., 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1') with keystroke logging capabilities, combined with .NET assembly loads and file creation in user directories, indicates potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. Hmm, there are several entries with PowerShell commands running scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines all have similar structures, with different paths but the same script name and log path. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with malware or spyware.\n\nI notice that the log paths are all pointing to the TEMP directory with key.log. Multiple instances of this script being executed from various locations might indicate an attempt to capture keystrokes repeatedly. Also, there are file creation and deletion events related to PowerShell scripts, which could be part of an attack lifecycleâ€”downloading, executing, and cleaning up logs.\n\nHowever, there are also normal activities like Windows Defender loading DLLs and temporary files being created by PowerShell, which are common. But the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths raises a red flag. Even though some entries are benign, the pattern here is consistent with malicious behavior. The presence of multiple such events increases the likelihood that this is a security incident worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts from varying paths, consistently logging keystrokes to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to check each event for any suspicious activity.\n\nThe first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The file path mentioned is under the NetworkService's AppData, which is a common location for system-related files. The file name is keyValueLKG.dat, which sounds like a normal state or configuration file. I don't see anything obviously malicious here. DeliveryOptimization is a feature in Windows for managing updates, so this might be part of normal system operations. However, sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes. But without more context, this alone might not be suspicious.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs. The file path here is in the Downloads folder, which is typical for user-installed software. The .new extension suggests it might be a temporary file during configuration. This seems normal, especially if the user is setting up Winlogbeat. However, if this file was created without user interaction, that could be a red flag. But the event doesn't mention any unusual activity, so I can't confirm that yet.\n\nThe third event is about powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads directory. PowerShell is a common tool used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Creating a text file could be harmless, like saving a script or data. But if the file is part of a larger malicious operation, like downloading additional payloads or executing commands, that would be concerning. However, the event only mentions the file creation, not any execution or network activity. So, on its own, this might not be suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch together. All three events are file creations by different processes. None of them show signs of malware, but I need to check for patterns. The first event is a system process, the second a legitimate tool, and the third a common scripting tool. All are in expected locations. There's no indication of unusual network traffic, privilege escalation, or other malicious behaviors. The files created are either system-related or user-generated. \n\nI should consider if these events could be part of a larger attack. For example, if the PowerShell file was created as part of a script that later downloads malware, but the batch only shows the file creation. Since the events are isolated and don't show other suspicious activities, the confidence level is low. The classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity in the provided events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes creating files in expected locations (system directories, user Downloads folder). No suspicious patterns, malware indicators, or anomalous behavior detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
