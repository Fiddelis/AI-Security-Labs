{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not suspicious. But then there's powershell.exe involved in several events. \n\nLooking at the powershell entries: there's a process creation with a command line that starts another script. The command_line shows \"Start-Process\" with paths like \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\". Wait, the path has \"..\\\" which might indicate moving up a directory. That could be a red flag if it's trying to access files in parent directories, maybe to bypass security measures.\n\nThen there are image loaded events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. Some of them are standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, which are normal. But there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Not sure if that's a problem, but maybe not suspicious.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts to create temporary files, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be part of normal operations. However, if the file is malicious, it could be a sign. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be normal for communication between processes, but again, not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nThe multiple Provider Lifecycle events with Start-Process commands. The paths here are similar, with \"..\\\" in them. This might be an attempt to execute scripts from different directories, possibly to evade detection. If these scripts are benign, it's okay, but if they're malicious, that's a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: The chrome.exe events are likely normal. The powershell activities, especially the multiple Start-Process commands with paths that use \"..\\\" could indicate something suspicious. The file creation and deletion is common but might be part of a larger pattern. However, the presence of multiple ProcessCreate and ImageLoad events for powershell, along with the command lines, suggests possible malicious activity. However, without more context like the content of the scripts or unusual network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of these events might warrant further investigation. So the classification would be INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior, including process creation with potentially obfuscated paths (e.g., '..\\\\'), loading of .NET-related DLLs, and temporary file creation\/deletion. While some activities are normal, the combination of these events may indicate an attempt to execute scripts or payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first few entries have command lines like 'Start-Process' with paths that have '..\\' in them. Wait, those are relative paths. For example, \"C:\\\\objeto_padrao\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat\". The '..\\\\' part would resolve to the parent directory, so the actual path might be \"C:\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat\". But why are they using relative paths here? That could be a way to obfuscate the real path, making it harder to track. Maybe the attacker is trying to avoid detection by not using absolute paths directly.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries with 'Registry value set' events for processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While registry changes can be normal, if there's a lot of them, especially from unexpected processes, that might be a red flag. However, Chrome and PowerShell are legitimate applications, so this might not be malicious on its own.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File created' event for 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. Creating files in user directories can be normal, but depending on the context, it could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events include 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender and 'urlmon.dll'. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal operation.\n\nNow, considering the repetition of PowerShell commands with relative paths. The use of '..\\' might indicate that the attacker is trying to access files in a way that's not immediately obvious. If these scripts are malicious, they could be downloading or executing payloads. However, just the presence of these paths doesn't confirm malicious intent. But combined with multiple PowerShell processes and registry changes, it might be worth looking into.\n\nI should also check if there's any pattern in the file paths. The paths like 'tarefa_ativo', 'estrutura_base', etc., don't immediately ring any bells. They might be part of legitimate software, but the obfuscation with relative paths is suspicious.\n\nThe confidence here is moderate. There's enough unusual activity (relative paths in PowerShell commands, multiple registry changes) to warrant further investigation, but not enough to be certain it's malicious. So the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands with suspicious relative paths (e.g., '..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\...') that may obfuscate true file locations. Combined with repeated registry modifications and file creation events, this suggests potential obfuscation or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a list of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the events. There are multiple entries with different processes and actions. The main tasks mentioned are Registry value set, Image loaded, and File created. \n\nI notice that several events involve 'chrome.exe' with Registry value set actions. However, that alone might not be suspicious because Chrome can legitimately modify the registry. But then there are two Image loaded events where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these files is normal, so maybe that's not a problem. \n\nThen there's svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That seems normal too, as svchost is a system process that hosts various services. \n\nNext, powershell.exe is creating files in the Downloads directory. Creating files there isn't necessarily bad, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. However, just creating a text file might not be a red flag. \n\nAnother point is that winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. \n\nLooking at the frequency, there are a lot of Registry value set events from chrome.exe. But if they're all legitimate, that's not an issue. However, if there's an unusual number or specific registry keys being modified, that could be a concern. But the data provided doesn't specify which registry keys, so I can't tell. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the combination of all events. Are there any suspicious patterns? The ImageLoad events are on legitimate files. The FileCreate events are in user directories, which is normal. The only thing that stands out is the high number of Registry events from chrome.exe, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nHowever, since there's no indication of malicious files being loaded or created, and all the processes involved are standard (even though chrome.exe is doing a lot of registry changes, which might be normal for some extensions or settings), maybe this isn't interesting. \n\nBut maybe the high frequency of Registry changes by chrome.exe could be a sign of something, but without knowing the specific keys or other context, it's hard to be certain. The justification would need to be that there's no clear malicious activity detected, so it's not interesting. Confidence might be around 0.6, but not high enough to be certain. \n\nWait, but the user said to consider the combination. The fact that chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry changes, but also loading legitimate DLLs. Maybe the presence of multiple registry changes isn't enough. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that there are two different files created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. Maybe that's not suspicious. \n\nOverall, I think the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING, with the justification that no clear malicious behavior is detected, and confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"No clear malicious behavior detected; events involve standard processes (chrome.exe, svchost.exe) performing legitimate actions (registry modifications, loading known system DLLs, file creation in user directories). No suspicious file paths or anomalous process behavior identified.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
