{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating various JavaScript files in the Office application's resources directory. The files all have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js\", with different hash-like suffixes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's normal here. Office applications sometimes use localized resources, and minified JavaScript files are common in web apps. The \"strings\" part might refer to language-specific strings, which makes sense for localization. The hashes could be versioning or unique identifiers for different builds.\n\nBut why so many files? The same file is being created multiple times with different hashes. That might be part of an update process, where different versions are being deployed. However, if this is happening frequently or in a short period, it could indicate something unusual. However, the logs don't show any errors or unusual activity, just the creation of these files.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. Microsoft Office does have processes related to updates and resource management. If the files are being created in the expected directories and the process is legitimate, this might be normal. However, if the files are being created in unexpected locations or if there are other suspicious activities, that could be a red flag.\n\nAnother angle: the repetition of the same file names with different hashes. If this is part of a legitimate update, the system might be replacing old versions with new ones. But the logs show multiple creations, not deletions or replacements. Maybe the process is generating new versions each time, which could be normal if it's part of a dynamic resource loading mechanism.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a malware infection. Some malware uses legitimate-sounding process names to avoid detection. However, without additional indicators like unexpected network activity, high CPU usage, or other suspicious logs, it's hard to confirm that.\n\nIn the absence of other anomalies, the most plausible explanation is that this is part of a normal update or resource management process by Microsoft Office. The files are likely legitimate resources being deployed as part of an update or localization package. The repetition might be due to different versions being installed or cached.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is creating multiple **minified JavaScript files** (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js`) in the Office application's resource directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Files**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft process associated with **Office updates, resource management, and localization**.\n   - The generated files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js`) are **minified JavaScript files**, commonly used in web applications for performance optimization.\n\n2. **File Naming**:\n   - The `min_xxxxx.js` format suggests **localized resource strings** (e.g., language-specific text) for Office applications.\n   - The hash-like suffixes (e.g., `0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305`) likely represent **versioning or unique identifiers** for different builds or updates.\n\n3. **Repetition**:\n   - The same file names are created multiple times with different hashes. This could indicate:\n     - **Incremental updates** (replacing old versions with new ones).\n     - **Caching or redundancy** during deployment.\n     - **Dynamic resource loading** for different locales or configurations.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Normal?**\n- **Yes**, if:\n  - The files are created in the **expected directory** (`%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\resources` or similar).\n  - No **malicious activity** (e.g., unexpected network traffic, high CPU usage, or tampering with system files) is observed.\n  - The process **SDXHelper.exe** is running in the context of a **trusted Microsoft Office update**.\n\n- **Red Flags** (if present):\n  - Files created in **unusual locations** (e.g., system directories or user data).\n  - **Unusual timestamps** or **corruption** of existing files.\n  - **High resource usage** or **unrelated processes** running alongside SDXHelper.exe.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy**:\n   - Confirm that **SDXHelper.exe** is signed by Microsoft (check digital signature in Task Manager or file properties).\n   - Ensure the files are in the **expected directory**.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Check for **unexpected changes** to the files (e.g., size, content, or permissions).\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **SIEM systems** to detect suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Update Office**:\n   - Ensure Office is up to date, as outdated software may trigger unexpected resource generation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate**, part of **Office's localization or update process**. However, **monitor for anomalies** and ensure the process and files are **trusted**. If no other suspicious behavior is observed, this is **normal system activity**. \n\nIf you suspect malware, perform a **full system scan** and check for **unauthorized changes** to system files."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're suspicious. The user mentioned that SDXHelper is creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the Office Packages directory. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should check the process name. SDXHelper doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows process. Common processes are things like explorer.exe, svchost.exe, or system-related ones. SDXHelper sounds more like a third-party or maybe even a malicious tool. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLooking at the file paths: they're all in C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\... That's a common location for some legitimate software, but Office itself usually doesn't create JavaScript files in that directory. The filenames are all officeaicopilot-strings.min.js with different hashes. The \"min\" suggests minified JavaScript, which is common for web apps, but in the context of Office, that's unusual.\n\nThe repetition of the same filename with different hashes might indicate that the process is generating multiple files, possibly as part of some automated task. However, if this is part of a legitimate application, there might be a reason, but I don't recall any standard Office tools doing this.\n\nAnother thing to note: the process is creating files in the AppData folder. While that's a common place for user-specific data, if the process is not associated with any known application, that could be a red flag. Also, the fact that the files are JavaScript might be a clue. Maybe it's related to some add-in or script, but again, not typically in that location.\n\nI should also consider if there's any mention of other processes or system changes. The logs provided only show these file creations. No other processes or network activity mentioned. But the fact that it's creating so many files in a short time might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, the filename has \"aicopilot\". That might be a typo or a specific term. Maybe \"AI Copilot\"? Like the new AI features in Office? But even then, I don't think Microsoft would be creating minified JS files in the AppData directory for that. That seems more like a local application or a local script.\n\nAnother angle: the process name SDXHelper. Maybe it's part of some software installation. But if the user hasn't installed anything new recently, that's a problem. If they have, maybe it's legitimate. But without knowing the user's context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn terms of threat indicators, creating a lot of files in user directories, especially with unique hashes, could be a sign of malware trying to inject or persist. But again, it's not definitive. Maybe it's a legitimate application that's just misconfigured.\n\nI think the key points here are the unusual process name, the location of the files, the type of files created, and the repetition. These factors together might suggest that this is suspicious. However, without more information, it's a bit of a judgment call. But given the data provided, I'd lean towards it being suspicious and recommend further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show repeated file creation events by the process **SDXHelper** in the directory `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`, generating minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) with unique hash suffixes. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Risks**\n1. **Unusual Process Name**:\n   - **SDXHelper** is not a standard Windows process. Legitimate processes typically have names tied to known software (e.g., `explorer.exe`, `svchost.exe`, or Microsoft Office-related executables). The lack of clear association raises suspicion.\n\n2. **File Location and Type**:\n   - The files are created in the **AppData** directory, which is a common location for user-specific data but **not typical for Microsoft Office** to generate JavaScript files.\n   - The use of **minified JavaScript** (`*.min.js`) is common in web applications but **unusual in the context of Office** or system-level processes.\n\n3. **Repetition and Hashes**:\n   - The same filename is generated repeatedly with different hash suffixes (`min_36583c210f830012b2e0ed5ecf3b3741.js`, etc.). This pattern could indicate:\n     - **Malware persistence** (e.g., generating files to avoid detection).\n     - **Automated script execution** (e.g., a legitimate process with a misconfiguration).\n     - **Data exfiltration** (e.g., writing logs or payloads to disk).\n\n4. **Lack of Context**:\n   - No other system events (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or user interaction) are mentioned. This isolation makes it harder to determine intent but increases the risk of hidden malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware**: The process could be **malware** (e.g., a downloader, backdoor, or cryptomining tool) generating files to execute code or persist on the system.\n- **Legitimate Misconfiguration**: A legitimate application (e.g., a third-party Office add-in) might be misconfigured to write files to unexpected locations.\n- **False Positive**: If the user recently installed software named \"SDXHelper,\" this could be a false positive, but no such context is provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Process**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to inspect **SDXHelper** (e.g., check its digital signature, parent process, and command-line arguments).\n   - Search for the process name in the system (e.g., via `Get-Process` in PowerShell or `tasklist`).\n\n2. **Check File Contents**:\n   - Analyze the generated `.min.js` files using a hex editor or antivirus tool to detect malicious code (e.g., obfuscated scripts, payloads, or C2 communication).\n\n3. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/endpoint detection tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n\n4. **Monitor Behavior**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **SIEM** to track further file operations, network activity, or registry changes by **SDXHelper**.\n\n5. **Isolate and Investigate**:\n   - If **SDXHelper** is untrusted, isolate the system and investigate its origin (e.g., check installation logs, recent downloads, or user activity).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe behavior is **suspicious** and warrants further investigation. While it could be a false positive (e.g., a legitimate tool with a rare name), the combination of unusual process name, unexpected file location, and repetitive file generation strongly suggests **potential malware activity**. Immediate action (e.g., scanning, isolating, and analyzing) is recommended."}

So, the user provided a bunch of entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office Package Resources directory. The files all have names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash and .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses helper processes, but sometimes malware does too. The key here is the file names. The \"officeaicopilot\" part makes me think of Microsoft Office, maybe some add-in or feature. However, the \".min.js\" suggests minified JavaScript, which is common in web apps but not typically in Office packages. \n\nNow, looking at the path: \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\....\" That's a common directory for Office to store temporary files or add-ins. But why are there so many files being created? Each entry is a different hash, which might indicate unique files. However, if this is part of a legitimate update or installation, there might be multiple files. But the repetition of the same process creating multiple files could be a sign of something else, like a downloader or a malicious payload.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the files are being created by SDXHelper.exe. If this is a legitimate process, maybe during an update, it's normal. But if it's not, then it's suspicious. I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate file. A quick search in my mind: Microsoft does have some helper executables, but I'm not sure about SDXHelper specifically. Maybe it's related to some third-party software or an add-in.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that all these files are JavaScript minified files in the Office directory. Office doesn't typically use JavaScript in that way. Maybe this is a malicious script being injected, or perhaps a false positive. But the sheer number of files being created might be a red flag. Malware often generates multiple files with random names to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the hashes are different each time, which could be part of a payload delivery mechanism. If each file is a different component of malware, that's concerning. However, without more context, like the system's behavior, other logs, or antivirus alerts, it's hard to tell. But based solely on these logs, the pattern is suspicious. The process is creating numerous JavaScript files in a non-standard location, which isn't typical for legitimate software. \n\nSo, the conclusion here is that this activity is likely malicious. The files could be part of a dropper or a downloader, and the SDXHelper.exe might be a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one. The user should investigate further by checking the file's digital signatures, running a malware scan, and possibly analyzing the files with a sandbox or virus scanner.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate repeated activity by **SDXHelper.exe** creating numerous JavaScript files (`.min.js`) in the **Microsoft Office** directory, with filenames containing obfuscated hashes (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`). This behavior raises significant security concerns and is highly suspicious for the following reasons:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Red Flags**\n1. **Unusual File Location and Type**:\n   - **JavaScript files** (`.min.js`) are uncommon in **Microsoft Office's local directories** (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`). These files are typically associated with web applications, not desktop software like Office.\n   - The presence of **minified JavaScript** (`min_`) suggests obfuscation, which is often used to hide malicious code.\n\n2. **High Volume of Files**:\n   - Over **20+ files** are created, each with unique hashes. This pattern is characteristic of **malware droppers** or **payload delivery mechanisms**, where multiple files are generated to evade detection.\n\n3. **Suspicious Process Name**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Microsoft process. While some legitimate software may use helper processes, the lack of a clear association with Microsoft Office or known legitimate applications raises concerns.\n\n4. **Potential for Malware**:\n   - The files could be **malicious payloads** (e.g., scripts for data exfiltration, ransomware, or other attacks). The use of hashes in filenames may indicate **anti-analysis techniques** to avoid detection by static analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Check Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Verify the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., via Task Manager > Details > Right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures).\n   - Search for the process in **Windows Defender** or third-party antivirus tools for alerts.\n\n2. **File Analysis**:\n   - Submit the generated `.min.js` files to a **malware analysis platform** (e.g., VirusTotal, AnyRun) for behavioral and static analysis.\n   - Use a **sandbox** to execute the files in a controlled environment (if safe to do so).\n\n3. **System Scan**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/malware removal tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n\n4. **Check for Unusual Network Activity**:\n   - Monitor network traffic for **unauthorized outbound connections** (e.g., to C2 servers) using tools like Wireshark or Microsoft Network Monitor.\n\n5. **System Integrity**:\n   - Check for **tampering** using tools like **Microsoft Defender ATP** or **Sysinternals** utilities (e.g., `Process Explorer`, `Autoruns`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe observed behavior is **highly indicative of malware**. The combination of unusual file types, high volume of generated files, and the suspicious process name strongly suggests a **security threat**. Immediate investigation and mitigation are recommended to prevent potential data breaches or system compromise."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events. The main thing here is that I need to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\... and they have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a hash. The fact that they're all in the same location and have similar naming might indicate something. Maybe they're part of a legitimate process, but the repetition could be a sign of something else.\n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe – I should check if that's a known legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of the Office Deployment Tool or something similar. But creating so many files with similar names in the same directory might be unusual. Typically, such tools might install or update components, but generating multiple files with different hashes could be a red flag. However, it's also possible that these are just different language packs or updates.\n\nAnother point is that there are also events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. But those are separate and might not be related. However, the main focus here is on the SDXHelper activities. The key thing is the pattern of file creation. If this is a normal installation, there might be a certain number of files, but creating so many (like 15 entries here) might be excessive.\n\nAlso, looking at the file names: officeaicopilot-strings.min_... \"aicopilot\" might be a typo or a specific term. Wait, \"AICO\" could be part of a name, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a misspelling of \"AI Copilot,\" which is a feature in some Microsoft products. If these files are related to AI Copilot, then maybe they're part of an update or installation. But again, the number of files seems high.\n\nAnother angle: the hashes in the filenames. Each file has a unique hash, which might be part of versioning. However, if this is a legitimate process, the system would usually handle that without generating so many files. Alternatively, it could be a malicious process creating multiple files to hide its activities. But I need more context. Since the user hasn't provided any other logs or information, I have to rely on the given data.\n\nThe presence of multiple file creation events by the same process in the same directory could indicate either a normal installation or a suspicious activity. Without knowing the expected behavior of SDXHelper.exe, it's hard to say. However, the sheer number of files and the repetition in the naming might be a red flag. It's possible that this is a benign process, but in the absence of additional information, the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer would be that this is interesting for investigation because of the repetitive file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory with similar names, which could indicate either a normal process or a potential security issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a pattern of activity that warrants investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Location:** All files are created in the same directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`.\n   - **File Naming:** The filenames follow a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`, where `<hash>` appears to be a unique identifier (e.g., `4f3a1b2c`, `5d6e7f8a`).\n   - **Frequency:** Over 15 file creation events are logged, all attributed to `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n2. **`SDXHelper.exe` Context:**\n   - This process is associated with Microsoft Office, particularly the **Office Deployment Tool** (used for installing or updating Office). However, **normal operations typically do not involve creating dozens of files with unique hashes in this directory**.\n\n3. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - **Unusual Behavior:** While `SDXHelper.exe` is legitimate, the repetitive creation of files with unique hashes in a non-standard location (e.g., `SolutionPackages`) could indicate:\n     - **Malicious Activity:** A potential attempt to obfuscate malicious payloads by generating numerous files (e.g., droppers, staged components).\n     - **Legitimate but Unusual Process:** A rare Office-related operation (e.g., language pack installation, AI Copilot integration) that may not be well-documented.\n\n4. **Other Events:**\n   - **`chrome.exe` Registry Modifications:** These are unrelated and may be part of normal Chrome operations (e.g., updates, extensions). No immediate red flags here.\n\n### Why This Is Interesting:\n- **High Volume of Files:** The sheer number of files created by a single process in a specific directory is atypical for standard software behavior.\n- **File Naming Pattern:** The use of unique hashes in filenames may suggest obfuscation or data fragmentation, common in malware.\n- **Lack of Context:** No additional logs (e.g., error messages, network activity) are provided to confirm whether this is benign or malicious.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation:\n1. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe` Legitimacy:**\n   - Check the file's digital signature (ensure it's signed by Microsoft).\n   - Confirm its location on disk (should be in `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office` or similar).\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents:**\n   - Examine the files (if accessible) for suspicious content (e.g., embedded payloads, obfuscation).\n\n3. **Monitor for Further Activity:**\n   - Check for network traffic, registry changes, or process injections related to these files.\n\n4. **Correlate with System Behavior:**\n   - Determine if this activity coincides with an Office update, AI Copilot deployment, or other user-initiated actions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe repetitive file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` in a non-standard directory with obfuscated filenames is **suspicious and warrants further investigation**. While it could be a legitimate but rare Office-related process, the pattern aligns with tactics used by malware to evade detection. A deeper forensic analysis is recommended. \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** due to the unusual behavior and potential for malicious intent."}

Here's an analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and File Behavior**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is the process responsible for creating the files.\n   - The files are named with a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, where `<hash>` appears to be a unique identifier (e.g., `6cbe6a5cdc44c9a54cabe06c1615d335`).\n   - The files are minified JavaScript, which is common in web applications but unusual in the context of the **Microsoft Office** directory.\n\n2. **Directory Path**:\n   - The files are being created in `PackageResources\\Offline\\...`, a directory typically associated with **Microsoft Office** updates or resources. However, the presence of `officeaicopilot-strings` suggests this may be unrelated to legitimate Office operations.\n\n3. **Volume of Activity**:\n   - Over **16 files** are created in quick succession, each with a unique hash. This is highly unusual for legitimate software, which typically does not generate such a large number of files in this location.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual File Naming and Location**:\n  - The `officeaicopilot-strings` prefix is not associated with any known Microsoft Office component.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's Resources\/OfflineFiles. The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash or some unique string. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, possibly related to the setup or updates. It might be involved in installing or configuring components. However, the fact that it's creating so many files with similar names could be a red flag. \n\nNow, the filenames have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which sounds like it could be related to some kind of localization files or resources. The \".min\" extension usually indicates a minified JavaScript file, but that's more common in web development. However, Microsoft Office might use similar naming conventions for their own resources.\n\nBut wait, creating multiple files with the same base name but different hashes might be normal if they're different language packs or versions. However, the repetition here is a lot. Let me check if the same file is being created multiple times. Looking at the entries, each entry has a different hash, so each file is unique. But why so many? Maybe during an update, multiple resources are being deployed.\n\nHowever, another angle: malware sometimes uses legitimate-sounding process names to hide their activities. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if this is a malicious file, it could be masquerading as the real one. But the user hasn't indicated any signs of malware here. \n\nThe key points here are the process name, the directory, and the files being created. The directory is part of Microsoft Office's installation path, which is expected for setup-related activities. The creation of multiple resource files might be part of an update or installation process. However, the number of files seems high. Typically, updates might add a few files, but not 15+ in a short period. \n\nAnother thing to consider is if these files are temporary or part of a larger installation. If the system is in the middle of an Office update or installation, this could be normal. But the user hasn't provided context about recent installations or updates. \n\nAlternatively, if these files are being created repeatedly without a clear purpose, that might indicate an issue. However, the fact that each file has a unique hash suggests they are distinct resources. \n\nIn conclusion, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. But given that SDXHelper is a legitimate process and the files are in the expected directory, this might be a normal part of Office's operation. However, the high number of files created could warrant further investigation to ensure there's no malicious activity. But based on the information provided, the answer is likely that this is a normal process.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Events:**\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process is creating multiple files in the directory `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\Office\\Resources\\OfflineFiles`. The filenames follow a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, where `<hash>` is a unique identifier.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Process Legitimacy:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, typically associated with the **Office Deployment Tool** or **Click-to-Run** installation\/update processes. It is used to manage Office resources, including language packs, updates, and configuration files.\n\n2. **File Purpose:**\n   - The filenames (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) suggest they are **minified JavaScript resource files**. These could be part of:\n     - **Language packs** for Office applications (e.g., localized UI strings).\n     - **Offline resources** for web-based Office features (e.g., Excel Online, PowerPoint Online).\n     - **Updates or patches** deployed via the Office 365 Click-to-Run platform.\n\n3. **High Volume of Files:**\n   - The creation of 15+ files with unique hashes may indicate a **large-scale update** or **installation of multiple language packs**. This is not uncommon during major Office updates or when users install Office in multiple languages.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - While the process and files are legitimate, the **repetition of file creation** could be a red flag if:\n     - The files are **identical** (suggesting redundancy or malicious activity).\n     - The process is running **unexpectedly** (e.g., without user initiation).\n     - The system is experiencing **unusual performance issues** (e.g., high disk I\/O).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe activity is **likely legitimate**, as it aligns with the expected behavior of `SDXHelper.exe` during Office updates or installations. However, further investigation is recommended if:\n- The files are **not part of a known Office update**.\n- The process is **running outside of expected contexts** (e.g., at odd times, with no user interaction).\n- The system shows **unusual behavior** (e.g., slow performance, unexpected network activity).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Verify if a recent Office update or installation was initiated.\n- Check the **Office logs** (`%temp%\\OfficeSetupLogs`) for details about the update process.\n- Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Windows Defender** to confirm the legitimacy of the process and files."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating a lot of files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" in a specific directory. They probably want to know if this is normal or if it's a potential security issue.\n\nFirst, I should check what SDXHelper.exe is. Maybe it's part of a legitimate software, like Microsoft Office or another application. The file names include \"officeaicopilot,\" which might be related to some feature or localization files. But the fact that there are so many files being created could be a red flag. Are these files part of a normal update or installation process, or are they being generated in an unusual way?\n\nI should consider common malware behaviors. Malware often creates many files in temporary or user directories, especially if they have random or obfuscated names. The presence of \"min\" in the file names might be a red herring, but the high volume and repetition could be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the directory path is \"Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\" which is a legitimate location for Office-related files. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that's a problem. I should verify if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate component. Maybe the user can check the file's digital signature or its location on the system. If it's in a non-standard directory, that's a bad sign.\n\nAlso, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might indicate that the process is being executed repeatedly, which could be a sign of a worm or a script that's looping. However, if these are just multiple versions of the same file, maybe for different languages or updates, that's normal.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the user is running a legitimate software that's just generating a lot of files as part of its operation. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: high volume of file creation, repetition, the process name, and the directory location. The user should check the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, look for any associated malware, and ensure that their system is up to date with security patches. If they're unsure, running a malware scan or consulting with a security professional would be advisable.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries you provided show repeated creation of files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>` by the process `SDXHelper.exe` in the directory `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`. Here's an analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **High Volume of File Creation**:\n   - Over 20 files are created in rapid succession, with repeated file names (e.g., `min_8ebfe07f2f3572ae1923f187f9f5ac20.js`).\n   - This pattern is **unusual** for legitimate software, which typically does not generate such a large number of files in a temporary or user-specific directory.\n\n2. **File Naming and Hashes**:\n   - The filenames include obfuscated hashes (e.g., `8ebfe07f2f3572ae1923f187f9f5ac20`), which are common in **malware** or **exploits** to evade detection.\n   - The prefix `officeaicopilot-strings.min_` suggests a potential **misuse of Microsoft Office-related processes** or a **fake localization file**.\n\n3. **Process Name (`SDXHelper.exe`)**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Microsoft Office component. Legitimate Microsoft Office processes are typically named `EXCEL.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `OUTLOOK.EXE`.\n   - A quick search shows no official Microsoft documentation about `SDXHelper.exe`, raising **red flags** about its legitimacy.\n\n4. **Directory Location**:\n   - The files are created in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`, a directory typically used by **Microsoft Office** for temporary files. If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a legitimate Office process, this could indicate **malware masquerading as a legitimate process**.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n1. **Malware or Exploit**:\n   - The behavior matches **malware** that:\n     - Uses obfuscated filenames to avoid detection.\n     - Exploits vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office or Windows to execute malicious code.\n     - Creates temporary files for payload delivery or persistence.\n\n2. **Legitimate Software Misbehavior**:\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a legitimate application (e.g., a third-party Office add-in or tool), the file creation might be a **bug** or **misconfiguration**. However, this is **unlikely** given the suspicious filename pattern.\n\n3. **False Positive**:\n   - The logs could be from a **security tool** (e.g., antivirus or EDR) flagging normal activity as suspicious. However, the repetition and obfuscation make this less likely.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - **Check the file's digital signature**:\n     - Right-click the executable > **Properties** > **Digital Signatures** tab.\n     - If no signature exists or it's signed by an unknown entity, this is a strong indicator of malware.\n   - **Check the file's location**:\n     - Legitimate Microsoft Office processes are typically in `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\...` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n     - If `SDXHelper.exe` is in a user-specific directory (e.g., `AppData`), it is likely malicious.\n\n2. **Run a Malware Scan**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to scan for threats.\n   - Check for **unwanted programs** or **recently installed software** that might be associated with the process.\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Use **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to monitor `SDXHelper.exe` for suspicious network activity, memory usage, or interactions with other processes.\n   - Look for **unexpected parent processes** (e.g., `svchost.exe` or `explorer.exe`) that might be launching it.\n\n4. **Check for Exploits**:\n   - Ensure your system is up to date with **Windows Security Updates** and **Microsoft Office patches**.\n   - If you recently opened a suspicious email attachment or visited a malicious website, this could be the source of the infection.\n\n5. **Remove the File**:\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is confirmed malicious, delete it and any related files in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory.\n   - Use **Malwarebytes** or **HitmanPro** to clean up residual files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe behavior described is **highly suspicious** and strongly indicative of **malware**. The repeated creation of obfuscated files by an unknown process in a Microsoft Office directory is a classic sign of a **payload delivery mechanism** or **exploit**. Immediate action (malware scan, process verification, and system cleanup) is recommended to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created, and the process involved is mostly SDXHelper.exe, except for one instance where it's chrome.exe. The files created by SDXHelper.exe are all JavaScript files named similarly, with variations in the hash part of the filename. They're all stored in the same directory under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It might be involved in some kind of solution packaging or deployment. However, creating multiple JavaScript files with similar names could be part of a legitimate process, like updating or installing add-ins. But then again, the repetition of the same filenames might be a red flag. Are these files being created repeatedly, or is it a one-time event?\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe entry, it's creating a temporary file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal for Chrome to do, maybe downloading something. But the rest are all from SDXHelper.exe. The fact that there are so many files created by SDXHelper.exe in a short period might indicate some kind of activity that's not typical. However, without more context, like the system's usual behavior or other logs, it's hard to tell.\n\nI should check if the filenames are part of a known legitimate process. The names like officeaicopilot-strings.min.js make me think of Office add-ins or something related to the AI Copilot feature. If this is a new feature in Office, maybe it's downloading and creating these files as part of its setup. But why so many? Maybe each file is part of a different component or version.\n\nAnother angle: are these files being created by a legitimate process? SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process, so if it's doing this as part of its normal operations, it's okay. But if there's an unusual number of files or if the process is behaving differently, that could be suspicious. However, the user hasn't mentioned any security alerts or other anomalies.\n\nAlso, the temporary file created by Chrome might be unrelated, but it's worth noting. If there's a pattern where multiple files are created in the same directory by a legitimate process, it might not be a threat. However, if the user is concerned, checking the integrity of the SDXHelper.exe process and ensuring it's not a malware impersonating a legitimate process would be important.\n\nIn conclusion, without additional information, this might be a normal activity related to Office's AI Copilot feature. But the repetitive creation of similar files could also be a sign of something else. It's a bit ambiguous, but leaning towards legitimate if the process is verified and there are no other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the creation of multiple JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` with unique hash suffixes) by **SDXHelper.exe**, a legitimate Microsoft Office process, and a single temporary file created by **chrome.exe**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n   - **Files Created**: Over 15 JavaScript files with names like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js` in the directory:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceeb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n     ```\n   - **Pattern**: Files are named with a consistent base (`officeaicopilot-strings.min`) and unique hash-like suffixes, suggesting they may be part of a package or update.\n\n2. **chrome.exe Activity**:\n   - A single temporary file (`ad71f2ea-b333-47d3-90de-05df187121c9.tmp`) was created in the `Downloads` directory. This is typical for Chrome during downloads or temporary operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimacy Assessment**\n- **SDXHelper.exe**:\n  - **Known Process**: SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office and is used for managing solution packages (e.g., add-ins, templates, or AI-related features like Copilot).\n  - **Behavior**: Creating multiple files in a structured directory (e.g., `OfflineFiles`) could be part of deploying or caching resources for Office features (e.g., AI Copilot, add-ins, or language packs).\n  - **No Immediate Red Flags**: The filenames follow a pattern consistent with resource packaging, and the process is legitimate.\n\n- **chrome.exe**:\n  - The temporary file is unrelated to the SDXHelper.exe activity and is typical for Chrome.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n1. **Unusual Volume of Files**:\n   - While creating multiple files could be normal for packaging, the sheer number of files (15+ with unique hashes) might indicate **unusual activity** if this is not part of a known Office update or feature deployment.\n\n2. **Lack of Context**:\n   - Without additional logs (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or user-initiated actions), it’s difficult to confirm whether this aligns with expected behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Office Updates**:\n   - Check if the user recently installed an Office update or activated a new feature (e.g., AI Copilot). Microsoft has rolled out AI Copilot in Office 365, which may involve similar resource creation.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **SIEM** to monitor SDXHelper.exe for unusual behavior (e.g., network requests to unknown domains, unexpected file modifications).\n\n3. **Check File Integrity**:\n   - Ensure the files in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...` are not malicious. Use antivirus tools to scan the directory.\n\n4. **Review Chrome Activity**:\n   - Confirm the temporary file is related to a legitimate download (e.g., a user-initiated action) and not part of a phishing attempt.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** if it aligns with recent Office updates or feature deployments (e.g., AI Copilot). However, the repetitive creation of similar files warrants further investigation to rule out **unauthorized use of the SDXHelper.exe process** or **malware masquerading as a legitimate component**. If no recent Office changes are noted, a deeper forensic analysis is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. There are a bunch of entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by a hash. The first thing that comes to mind is that these files are probably part of some software update or installation process. The repetition of the same file names suggests that maybe the process is being called multiple times, perhaps due to a loop or a retry mechanism.\n\nNow, the file names have a pattern. They all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" and end with a unique hash. That makes me think these are minified JavaScript files, possibly part of an Office add-in or some web-based application. The \"min\" in the name indicates minification, which is common in web development to reduce file size.\n\nBut why so many of them? If this is part of a legitimate update, maybe the system is downloading multiple versions or parts of an update. However, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could also be a sign of something malicious. Malware sometimes uses similar naming conventions to disguise itself as legitimate files. The hashes could be random strings to avoid detection.\n\nAnother angle: the process is \"SDXHelper.exe\". I should check if that's a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper might be related to software distribution or updates, but it's not a standard Windows process. If it's not a recognized application, that's a red flag. Also, if the files are being created in the Office installation directory, that might be a sign of a compromise, especially if the user hasn't initiated any such updates.\n\nThe fact that all the files are being created by the same process in the same directory might indicate a script or installer that's not properly configured, leading to multiple creations of the same file. Alternatively, it could be a part of a legitimate process, but the sheer number of entries makes me cautious. \n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the system is legitimately updating Office, and the logs are just capturing each step. But without more context, like the user's actions or other logs, it's hard to tell. The key points here are the repetition, the naming pattern, and the process involved. These factors combined make it suspicious enough to warrant further investigation, such as checking the process's digital signature, its origin, and whether it's associated with any known malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate repeated creation of minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) by the process `SDXHelper.exe` in the Office installation directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, suggesting they are minified JavaScript files, possibly part of a web component, Office add-in, or software update.\n   - The use of unique hash suffixes may indicate versioning or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Process Involvement**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Windows process. It is commonly associated with **software distribution, updates, or third-party applications** (e.g., Adobe, Microsoft, or other installers). However, its legitimacy depends on the context (e.g., whether it is signed by a trusted publisher).\n\n3. **Repetition of Events**:\n   - The same files are created multiple times, which could indicate:\n     - A **retry mechanism** (e.g., failed updates or downloads).\n     - A **malicious process** generating files to mimic legitimate updates or evade detection.\n     - A **misconfigured installer** or script repeatedly attempting to write files.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Malware Activity**:\n  - The repetitive creation of files with obfuscated names (`<hash>`) is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a trusted application (e.g., unsigned or from an unknown source), this could indicate a **spear-phishing attack** or **ransomware** activity.\n\n- **Legitimate Update**:\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a legitimate software update (e.g., Office 365, Adobe, or other enterprise tools), the logs might simply capture incremental updates or component installations.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify the Process**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` using tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes**.\n   - Confirm if the file is part of a known application (e.g., search for `SDXHelper.exe` in the system's `%PROGRAMFILES%` or `%APPDATA%` directories).\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/malware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Kaspersky, or Malwarebytes).\n   - Use **VirusTotal** to submit the file for analysis.\n\n3. **Monitor Behavior**:\n   - Use **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals Suite** to track if `SDXHelper.exe` is accessing sensitive files, modifying the registry, or communicating with external IPs.\n\n4. **Check for Unauthorized Software**:\n   - Review recently installed applications or updates via **Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a Program**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs could represent a legitimate update process, the repetitive creation of obfuscated files by an unknown process (`SDXHelper.exe`) raises **red flags** for potential malicious activity. Further investigation into the process's origin and behavior is critical to rule out malware or unauthorized software."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a hash. The same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might indicate that the process is creating these files repeatedly. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is not a standard Windows process. I know that some legitimate software might use such names, but it's also common for malware to use similar naming conventions. The fact that these files are being created in the AppData directory under Microsoft Office could be a red flag because that's a common location for malicious activity.\n\nThen there are entries about chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer and is used for downloading content, which is normal. MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's also legitimate. But the presence of these image loads might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nHowever, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe is concerning. If this is a legitimate process, why is it creating so many files with the same name? Maybe it's part of an update or some kind of caching. But without more context, like the process's digital signature or its behavior over time, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother thing to note is that there's a mix of processes here. Chrome is doing normal things, but SDXHelper is being very active. The fact that there's no other suspicious activity like network connections or registry changes except for the registry value set by chrome.exe, which might be normal. \n\nBut the key point here is the unusual behavior of SDXHelper.exe. Since the files are being created repeatedly in a non-standard location and the process name isn't typical, this could be a sign of malware. The hashes in the filenames might be an attempt to obfuscate the file names, making it harder to detect. \n\nHowever, I should consider that maybe this is a legitimate application. For example, some office add-ins or custom tools might generate these files. But without more information, the safest assumption is that this is worth investigating further. The user would need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, verify its digital signature, and look into its network activity or other behaviors. \n\nIn summary, the repeated file creation by an unusual process in a sensitive directory is suspicious and merits further investigation. That's why I think this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate activity that warrants further investigation due to **suspicious behavior** observed in the system. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and rationale:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**\n- **Observation**: `SDXHelper.exe` is creating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the directory:  \n  `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`  \n  These files are created repeatedly (duplicates in the log), with filenames containing obfuscated hash strings (e.g., `min_eaf004e5319b47ef0404822a78e7075c.js`).\n\n- **Why Suspicious**:\n  - **Unusual Process Name**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process. While it could be a legitimate utility (e.g., a third-party tool or Office add-in), the lack of context raises concerns.\n  - **File Location**: The files are being written to the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory**, which is typically used for **legitimate Office add-ins or updates**. However, this location is also a common target for **malware** to persist or cache data.\n  - **Obfuscation**: The use of hash-based filenames may be an attempt to **avoid detection** or **mask malicious intent**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Chrome.exe Activity**\n- **Observation**: `chrome.exe` is loading standard system DLLs:\n  - `urlmon.dll` (part of Internet Explorer, used for downloading content).\n  - `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender, used for real-time protection).\n\n- **Why Not Suspicious**: These are **legitimate system components**, and their loading by Chrome is **expected behavior** (e.g., downloading content or interacting with security software).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Missing Context**\n- **No Digital Signatures**: The logs do not include information about whether `SDXHelper.exe` is digitally signed or its origin (e.g., installed software, user downloads).\n- **No Network or Registry Activity**: While the logs show file creation and registry writes, **no network connections** or **sensitive registry modifications** are reported. This limits the ability to confirm malicious intent definitively.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Interesting for Investigation**\nThe **repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` in a sensitive directory** with **obfuscated filenames** is **highly suspicious** and **merits further analysis**. Key next steps include:\n1. **Verify the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`** (e.g., check its digital signature, origin, and behavior via process monitoring tools like Process Explorer or malware scanners).\n2. **Monitor network activity** of `SDXHelper.exe` to detect data exfiltration or communication with malicious servers.\n3. **Check for other anomalies** (e.g., unusual registry changes, user account activity, or system performance degradation).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\nThis activity is **not conclusively malicious**, but it is **sufficiently unusual** to warrant **closer scrutiny**. If `SDXHelper.exe` is not associated with known legitimate software, it could indicate **malware persistence** or **data exfiltration**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The first one is chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems a bit odd because chrome usually doesn't interact with Defender's files. Maybe a legitimate process, but could be a red flag if unexpected.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft Office, right? So creating files there might be normal, but the repetition of the same file names could indicate something. Maybe part of an update or installation, but maybe also a sign of malicious activity if the files are being generated in an unusual way.\n\nChrome.exe has several registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate operations, but if done in a way that modifies critical keys, it could be malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are also events related to a file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" being downloaded and having Zone.Identifier streams created. That's typically how Windows marks downloaded files as coming from the internet, so that's normal. The DNS query from chrome.exe is also routine unless it's going to a suspicious domain.\n\nLooking at all the events together, the main suspicious points are the chrome.exe loading a Defender DLL and the repeated file creation by SDXHelper. However, SDXHelper creating files in Office's directory might be part of a legitimate process, especially if it's related to Office updates or add-ins. The repeated creation of the same JS files might be a sign of something, but without more info, it's hard to say. The chrome events seem more benign, like normal operations. \n\nI think the confidence here is medium. There are some unusual events, but they could be legitimate. Not enough to be certain, but there's enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple SDXHelper.exe instances creating identical JavaScript files in Microsoft Office directories may indicate malicious activity (e.g., injection of malicious scripts). Chrome.exe loading a Windows Defender DLL and repeated registry modifications also raise suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some Office add-in or solution package. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft Office process related to the Office add-in platform, right? So, normally, it might be involved in deploying or managing add-ins. But creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory... Hmm. I remember that sometimes malicious software can mimic legitimate processes. But in this case, the files are named with hashes or unique identifiers, which could be normal for versioning or different packages.\n\nWait, but there are several entries with the same file paths being created multiple times. Like officeaicopilot-strings.min_js files with different hash suffixes. That might be normal if they're different versions or parts of the same package. However, I should check if there's any suspicious activity elsewhere. \n\nLooking further, there's a chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for Internet Explorer, but Chrome might use it for certain tasks. Not sure if that's suspicious here. Then there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file, which is part of the Winlogbeat configuration. That seems normal if someone is setting up the tool. \n\nThe EXCEL.EXE process opening a spreadsheet file, which is just a regular user activity. Then loading combase.dll, which is part of the Windows COM system. Nothing unusual there. \n\nBut back to the SDXHelper.exe entries. The key point is whether creating multiple JS files in that directory is normal. I think that when Office solutions are deployed, they might generate such files. However, the presence of multiple files with different hashes could indicate either legitimate updates or potential malicious activity. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the files are in the OfflineFiles directory. Maybe that's where Office stores cached or offline resources. If the SDXHelper is part of the normal Office add-in deployment, then this might be legitimate. However, if there's an unexpected number of files or if they're being created in an unusual context, that could be a red flag. \n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any other processes or events that might indicate compromise? The other events seem normal. The only other thing is the Registry value set by chrome.exe, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nSo, the main concern here is the multiple FileCreate events by SDXHelper.exe. Since SDXHelper is a legitimate process, but the number of files and their names might be suspicious. However, without additional indicators like network activity, unexpected parent processes, or other anomalies, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nIn a real-world scenario, I might flag this for further investigation, especially if there are no other signs of compromise. But based solely on these logs, it's not definitively malicious. However, the repetitive creation of files with similar names might warrant closer inspection to ensure they're part of a legitimate deployment.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes multiple file creation activities by **SDXHelper.exe** in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory, which raises some concerns but does not definitively indicate malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (a legitimate Microsoft Office process related to add-ins).\n   - **Files Created:** JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_js`) with unique hash-like suffixes in the `OfflineFiles` subdirectory.\n   - **Frequency:** Multiple entries for the same file paths, suggesting repeated creation or updates.\n\n2. **Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - **Normal Behavior:** SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office Add-in Platform and may generate files during add-in deployment or updates.\n   - **OfflineFiles Context:** The `OfflineFiles` directory is used by Office for caching resources, so file creation here could be part of legitimate operations.\n\n3. **Other Events:**\n   - **Chrome.exe and EXCEL.EXE:** Standard processes interacting with system DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `combase.dll`) and opening a spreadsheet file. No obvious anomalies.\n   - **Winlogbeat.exe:** Creating a `.yml.new` file, which is typical during configuration setup.\n   - **Registry Event:** A `Registry value set` by Chrome.exe, but no specific malicious context is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags:**\n- **Repetitive File Creation:** The repeated generation of JavaScript files with hash-like names could indicate either:\n  - **Legitimate Updates:** Versioning of add-in resources.\n  - **Suspicious Activity:** Malicious actors mimicking legitimate processes to deploy payloads (e.g., obfuscated scripts).\n\n- **Lack of Context:** No additional indicators (e.g., network connections, unusual parent processes, or unexpected command-line arguments) are present to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Not Definitely Malicious:** The events align with the expected behavior of **SDXHelper.exe** in a Microsoft Office environment.\n- **However, Further Investigation is Recommended:**\n  - **Check File Contents:** Analyze the generated JavaScript files for obfuscation, suspicious code, or unexpected functionality.\n  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Investigate if these events are part of a larger pattern (e.g., unusual network activity, user behavior, or system changes).\n  - **Verify Add-In Sources:** Ensure that the Office add-ins associated with these files are from trusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\nWhile the events are not immediately suspicious, the repetitive file creation by **SDXHelper.exe** warrants closer scrutiny. If the files are legitimate, they likely represent updates to Office add-ins. If not, they could indicate a compromise. **Further analysis of the files and contextual logs is necessary to confirm safety.**"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The answer has to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first one is about SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The file is a JavaScript file. Then there are several entries about EXCEL.EXE loading various system DLLs like mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are normal system files, so loading them might be standard for Excel. But then there's a file created and deleted in the Downloads folder, which might be a temporary file, but the names look like they could be related to Excel documents.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events from svchost.exe. That could be normal, but multiple registry changes might be suspicious. Also, there's a Pipe Created event from EXCEL.EXE. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Office's SolutionPackages. That might be part of a malicious payload, especially if those files are being executed. However, the file names include hashes, which could be legitimate if they're part of a package. But the repetition of the same file being created twice might be a clue. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes and the pipe creation might indicate some unusual behavior.\n\nWait, but Excel is known to load various DLLs, and creating temporary files is common. However, the repeated registry changes from svchost.exe might be a sign of something trying to modify the registry, which is a common attack vector. Also, the SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office directory could be part of a malicious add-in or macro. But without more context, like the files being executed or network activity, it's hard to say.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The events alone don't show a clear attack, but the combination of unusual file creation, registry changes, and pipe creation might be enough to flag it as interesting. I think the classification would be INTERESTING with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6 or 0.7. The justification would be the combination of the suspicious file creation in Office directories, multiple registry changes, and the pipe event, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Office SolutionPackages directory (potential malicious payload), repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe (possible persistence mechanism), and Excel.EXE creating\/deleting temporary files with suspicious names. These patterns could indicate malware execution or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. That might be normal or could be suspicious, but I need more context. Then there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like am-et-ui-strings-json. That seems odd because those files are being created in a location typically used by Office for solutions, but the filenames suggest they might be part of some localization or resource files. However, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's part of some add-in or third-party software, but creating so many files in that directory could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThen there are events related to EXCEL.EXE creating streams in a temporary directory, including a Zone.Identifier, which is usually created when files are downloaded from the internet. That's normal, but combined with the other events, it might indicate that the user is opening files from untrusted sources. The ImageLoad events for coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL are standard system files, so those don't seem suspicious.\n\nThe repetition of SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files with similar names in the same directory is concerning. It could be part of a legitimate process, but given that the files are named in a way that suggests they are UI strings for different languages, it might be a sign of a malicious payload being dropped. However, without more information on what SDXHelper.exe is, it's hard to tell. The user might need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process or if it's part of a malicious package. Also, the presence of HxTsr.exe modifying the registry could be a red flag if that process isn't expected. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like network connections or unexpected process behavior, it might be a false positive. Still, the combination of these events warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Frequency:** Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating files in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - **File Names:** Files like `am-et-ui-strings-json_...js`, `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json_...js`, etc., suggest localization\/resource files for various languages.  \n   - **Concern:** While this could be part of a legitimate Office add-in or localization package, the repetitive nature and the use of a non-standard process (`SDXHelper.exe`) raise suspicion. Microsoft Office typically uses well-known processes, and `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft binary.\n\n2. **HxTsr.exe Registry Modification:**\n   - A single event shows `HxTsr.exe` modifying a registry value. This process is not commonly associated with standard Windows or Office operations.  \n   - **Concern:** Unfamiliar processes modifying the registry could indicate malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\n3. **Excel.EXE Activity:**\n   - **File Streams:** Multiple entries show `Excel.EXE` creating streams in a temporary directory, including a `Zone.Identifier` (common for downloaded files). This is normal behavior when opening files from the internet.  \n   - **Image Loads:** Loading of system DLLs (`coml2.dll`, `VBEUI.DLL`) is standard and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks:**\n- **SDXHelper.exe:** The repeated creation of files in a non-standard directory with language-specific names may indicate a **malicious payload being deployed** (e.g., a dropper or part of a phishing attack).  \n- **HxTsr.exe:** The registry modification by an unfamiliar process could be **malware establishing persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process (e.g., via file reputation, digital signatures, or vendor confirmation).\n   - Monitor for additional suspicious behavior (e.g., network connections, process injection).\n\n2. **Check for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/endpoint detection tools.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Sysinternals Suite** to inspect `SDXHelper.exe` and `HxTsr.exe` in real time.\n\n3. **Review Registry Changes:**\n   - Audit the specific registry key modified by `HxTsr.exe` to determine its purpose and whether it’s linked to known malicious configurations.\n\n4. **User Awareness:**\n   - Ensure the user is not opening untrusted files (e.g., Excel documents from unknown sources), as this could be part of a phishing or exploit chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity (e.g., Excel file streams) is normal, the presence of **unfamiliar processes** (`HxTsr.exe`, `SDXHelper.exe`) creating files in non-standard locations warrants further investigation. This could indicate **malware** or **a compromised system**, and immediate action is recommended to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so that's probably normal. The file path seems to be part of an installation or configuration, like .yml.new, which might be a temporary file during setup. Not too worrying here.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. The filenames are all .js files, and they're being placed in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. The repetition of the same file paths suggests that maybe there's an issue with the process creating these files repeatedly. But I need to check if that's normal behavior for SDXHelper. Wait, SDXHelper might be related to Office add-ins or solutions, but creating multiple copies of the same JS file could be a red flag. Maybe it's part of a package deployment, but the same file being created multiple times might indicate something else.\n\nThen there are several Registry value set events from Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're frequent or involve specific keys, they could be suspicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so it's hard to tell. The fact that Excel is involved in multiple registry events might be part of normal operation, like updating settings or shortcuts.\n\nLooking at the file creation events again, the SDXHelper.exe entries are creating files in the Office SolutionPackages. That directory is typically used for Office solutions, but the presence of multiple .js files with different names (fabric..., bn-in..., bs-latn...) might be part of a legitimate package. However, the repetition of the same file being created multiple times (like the fabric_...js file appearing twice) could be an error or an attempt to overwrite or inject code.\n\nAnother thing to note is the lack of any obvious malicious indicators like common malware names or suspicious file extensions. The files are all .js and .lnk, which are legitimate, but they can also be used for malicious purposes if manipulated. However, without more context, like the content of the files or the source of the processes, it's hard to confirm.\n\nThe user's system might be running some Office add-ins or custom solutions that are generating these files. But the repeated creation of the same files by SDXHelper could be a sign of a problem. Also, the Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE registry events are numerous, but again, without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to assess.\n\nConsidering all this, the most suspicious part is the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple copies of the same JS files. That might be a benign process, but in the absence of more information, it's worth investigating further. However, the logs don't provide enough evidence to definitively label this as malicious. It could be a false positive or a legitimate process. Therefore, the answer would be that there are some unusual activities that might warrant further investigation, but they aren't clearly malicious based solely on the provided logs.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system activity and potential anomalies that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Normal Activity**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a file in the **Downloads directory**: This is likely part of a legitimate configuration or installation process (e.g., `*.yml.new` files are common during setup).\n- **`EXCEL.EXE`** creating `.LNK` files in the **Recent** folder: This is standard behavior for Excel when tracking recently opened files.\n\n### **2. Suspicious Activity**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`** repeatedly creating **JavaScript files** in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages\/OfflineFiles** directory:\n  - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Windows process. Its presence and behavior (creating multiple identical `.js` files, e.g., `fabric_...js`, `bundle_...js`) are unusual.\n  - The **repetition of identical file paths** (e.g., `bundle_1fe8fdf08a76d34524f5d50f471c45e8.js` created twice) suggests either a bug, misconfiguration, or potentially malicious activity (e.g., overwriting files or injecting code).\n  - The **`OfflineFiles` directory** is typically used for caching, but the volume and nature of these `.js` files could indicate unauthorized deployment of scripts.\n\n### **3. Registry Events**\n- **`Explorer.EXE`** and **`EXCEL.EXE`** triggering multiple **Registry value set** events. While registry changes are normal, the lack of context (e.g., specific keys modified) makes it difficult to assess risk. However, **frequent changes by Excel** could indicate tampering or unusual behavior (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`**: Verify its legitimacy (e.g., file signature, parent process, origin). Check for associated malware or rogue software.\n- **Analyze the `.js` files**: Examine their content for obfuscation, malicious code, or unexpected functionality.\n- **Monitor registry changes**: Use tools like Sysmon or SIEM to correlate these events with other indicators of compromise (e.g., unexpected network activity, process injection).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`, Excel shortcuts) is benign, the **repeated creation of `.js` files by an unknown process (`SDXHelper.exe`)** and **frequent registry modifications** by Excel raise concerns. These could indicate a **misconfigured application**, **malware**, or **a false positive**. Further investigation is recommended. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** due to the anomalies in `SDXHelper.exe` behavior and registry activity."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's repeated 25 times. Then, there are a few entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\". Finally, there are two entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating a file in a specific path.\n\nHmm. The first thing that stands out is the repeated registry changes by EXCEL.EXE. Normally, Excel isn't known for modifying the registry extensively. But maybe that's not suspicious on its own. However, the repetition could be a red flag. But wait, maybe it's part of a legitimate process, like updating settings or macros. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's the SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path seems specific to Microsoft Office. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Office solutions, so creating files there might be normal. But the filename is a JavaScript file. I wonder if that's part of a legitimate Office add-in or something else. However, the presence of a .js file in that location might not be standard. Maybe it's a sign of a malicious payload being dropped.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the entire batch should be considered. So combining the registry changes with the file creation. If Excel is modifying the registry multiple times and then another process creates a file in a sensitive location, that might indicate something. However, the SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but the file path might be part of a normal Office operation. However, the repetition of registry events by Excel could be a sign of something else.\n\nBut I need to check if these events are part of a known benign activity. For example, Excel might modify the registry when macros are run or when certain settings are changed. But if it's done multiple times in a short period, that could be suspicious. However, the logs don't include timestamps, so I can't tell the timing. Without that, it's harder to assess.\n\nThe justification also needs to be concise. If the only suspicious thing is the SDXHelper creating a .js file, but that's in a legitimate directory, maybe it's not enough. However, the combination with the repeated registry events by Excel might be a sign of a larger issue. Alternatively, maybe the user is just using Excel normally, and the logs are capturing regular activity.\n\nBut the confidence here is tricky. If there's no clear malicious activity, but some unusual events, maybe it's a low confidence. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and a file creation might be enough to flag it as interesting. But I need to be careful not to overreact. Maybe the user is just using Excel with some add-ins that are modifying the registry. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn the end, the SDXHelper creating a file in that path might be benign, but the repeated registry changes by Excel could be a sign of something. However, since there's no other malicious activity mentioned, maybe it's not enough. But I think the combination of the two might be worth looking into. So I'd classify it as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the justification is that multiple registry modifications by Excel and a file creation in a specific path could indicate potential malicious activity, but more data is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE combined with a file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a Microsoft Office-specific directory may indicate potential malicious activity, such as a dropper or add-in tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names are JavaScript files with long, seemingly random strings. The same process is creating these files multiple times, and the paths are in the AppData folder, which is common for user-specific data but can also be a place where malicious software hides.\n\nNow, the other entries are from \"EXCEL.EXE\" and \"WINWORD.EXE\" (which is Word) creating temporary files in the Temp directory. That's normal behavior for applications to generate temporary files during operations. However, the fact that these are temporary files and the process names are legitimate Office applications might be part of normal operations.\n\nWait, but the main thing here is the repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe. I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the setup or updates. However, it's also possible that malware could use similar names. But in this case, the files being created are in the expected directories for Office packages, and the names are typical for resource files.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are so many files being created, all with different hashes (the long strings in the filenames) might be a red flag. Legitimate software usually doesn't generate that many unique files in such a pattern. Also, the presence of multiple entries for the same file being created again could indicate some kind of loop or repeated operation that's not normal.\n\nBut wait, looking at the timestamps, if these events are all happening in a short period, that could be suspicious. However, the logs don't provide timestamps, so I can't confirm that. Another point is that the files are JavaScript files. If they're part of a legitimate Office add-in or resource, that's okay. But if they're being created by a process that's not supposed to generate such files, that's a problem.\n\nI should also consider the user's context. If this is on a system where Office is being installed or updated, then these events might be normal. But if the user hasn't initiated any such activity, then it's more suspicious. Since the logs don't provide context about the system's state, I have to make assumptions based on the data given.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"Office\" directories but with file names that look like they could be part of a malicious payload. However, the process name is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate. So maybe this is just part of Office's normal operations, like installing language packs or add-ins. The multiple files with different language codes (like ca-es-valencia, cs-cz, etc.) might indicate language-specific resources, which is normal for Office.\n\nBut then why are there so many entries? Each file creation is logged, and there are duplicates. Maybe the process is being called multiple times, but if it's part of a legitimate installation or update, that's possible. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, while the process and file locations are somewhat normal for Office-related activities, the volume and pattern of file creation might warrant further investigation. It's not definitively malicious, but there are enough anomalies that it's worth looking into. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of Log Entries:**\n\n1. **Process Activity:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is repeatedly creating JavaScript files (`*.js`) in directories under `Microsoft Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`. \n   - **EXCEL.EXE** and **WINWORD.EXE** are creating temporary files in the `Temp` directory, which is typical for application operations.\n\n2. **File Patterns:**\n   - The JavaScript files have unique, random-looking filenames (e.g., `transcription-strings.min_41d770caa4405d96cfefae03e2c3685f.js`) and are stored in language-specific subdirectories (e.g., `ca-es-valencia`, `cs-cz`). These could represent localized resources or add-ins.\n\n3. **Legitimacy Considerations:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is associated with Microsoft Office (e.g., during installation\/updates), and the file paths align with Office's expected structure. \n   - However, the **volume and repetition** of file creation (e.g., multiple entries for the same file) may indicate unusual behavior, such as repeated operations or potential tampering.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The **absence of timestamps** makes it difficult to assess timing anomalies (e.g., rapid file creation).\n   - While the process names and locations are legitimate, the **unusual number of files** and their **non-standard naming** (e.g., `.min_...`) could hint at malicious activity (e.g., injection of payloads or resource files).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - **Interesting for Investigation:** The logs show activity consistent with Office operations but include patterns (e.g., high volume of unique files) that warrant further analysis to rule out anomalies or threats. No definitive malicious behavior is observed, but the context and volume of events justify closer examination.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nInvestigate the system for recent Office updates, check the integrity of `SDXHelper.exe`, and review the purpose of the created files. If no legitimate activity is confirmed, consider deeper forensic analysis."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like vendor_...js and ui-strings-json_...js. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? Maybe it's related to some add-ins or updates. But creating so many files in the SolutionPackages folder... That directory is typically used for storing solution packages, which are part of Office add-ins or customizations. However, the filenames here look like they might be part of a legitimate update or installation process.\n\nWait, but all the files are being created by the same process, and they're all in the same directory. That could be a sign of something malicious if it's unexpected. However, I should check if this is a known legitimate activity. For example, when Office updates or installs new features, it might generate temporary files or packages. But the repetition of the same filenames might indicate that the process is being run multiple times, which could be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the naming convention. The files have unique hashes in their names, which might be part of version control. But if these files are not part of any known Office update or add-in, that could be suspicious. Also, the fact that all the files are JavaScript might be normal for some scripts, but I should consider if there's any indication of malicious code.\n\nI should also think about the user context. If this is happening on a user's machine, maybe they installed a new add-in or updated Office. But if there's no user action, that might be concerning. However, without more context like error messages or other logs, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn summary, while SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, the high volume of file creations in the SolutionPackages folder with these filenames might be part of a normal process or could indicate a malicious activity. More investigation would be needed, such as checking for Office updates, examining the files' contents, or looking for other suspicious activities in the logs.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Log Entries:**\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process (associated with Microsoft Office) is repeatedly creating JavaScript files (`*.js`) in the `SolutionPackages` directory under the Office installation path. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Behavior?**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, often involved in managing add-ins, updates, or solution packages.\n- The `SolutionPackages` directory is typically used to store **Office Add-in packages** (`.sln`, `.js`, etc.) or temporary files during installation\/update processes.\n- The filenames (e.g., `ui-strings-json_...js`) resemble **localized resource files** or **script components** for Office add-ins, which might be part of a **legitimate update** or **customization**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Red Flags and Concerns**\n- **High Volume of Files**: The repetition of file creation (e.g., multiple entries for the same file) could indicate **redundant operations** or **malicious activity** (e.g., dropper behavior, data exfiltration).\n- **Unusual File Naming**: While the filenames include hashes (e.g., `328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10`), this is common in version-controlled files. However, the lack of clear context (e.g., no corresponding `.manifest` or `.xml` files) raises questions about their purpose.\n- **No User-Initiated Action**: If these files were created without user interaction (e.g., during an unexpected Office update or background process), it could signal **unauthorized activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Risks**\n- **Malware Disguised as Legitimate**: Attackers might exploit `SDXHelper.exe`'s legitimacy to inject malicious scripts or payloads into the `SolutionPackages` directory.\n- **Data Exfiltration**: JavaScript files could be used to exfiltrate data (e.g., through `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` calls) if compromised.\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The files might be part of a **malware persistence strategy**, such as embedding malicious code in seemingly benign scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n- **Check File Contents**: Analyze the contents of the `.js` files using a hex editor or antivirus tool to detect obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious network calls.\n- **Correlate with Office Logs**: Review Office-related logs (e.g., `OfficeSetup.exe`, `Click-to-Run` logs) to determine if this activity aligns with a known update or add-in installation.\n- **Monitor Network Traffic**: Use a network monitor (e.g., Wireshark, Microsoft Defender ATP) to check if these files communicate with external IPs or domains.\n- **Scan for Malware**: Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/EDR tools to rule out malware infections.\n- **Check for Unauthorized Add-ins**: Review Office add-ins via `File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Add-ins` to ensure no suspicious add-ins are installed.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could be **legitimate** (e.g., part of an Office update or add-in), the **repetitive file creation** and **lack of clear context** warrant further investigation. If no recent Office updates or add-in installations are confirmed, this behavior may indicate **malicious activity**. Immediate action (e.g., file analysis, network monitoring) is recommended to mitigate potential risks."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. All the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are named with language codes and hashes, like es-mx-ui-strings-json_...js. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It might handle add-ins or updates. Creating files in the SolutionPackages folder could be related to installing or updating Office add-ins or templates. The filenames suggest they're UI string resources for different languages, which makes sense if the software is being localized.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Are these files being created once during installation, or are they being generated repeatedly? If they're being created multiple times in a short period, that could indicate something unusual. But looking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if they're spread out, it might be normal.\n\nAnother point is the hash part of the filename. If these are legitimate files, they might have consistent hashes. But if the hashes change frequently, that could be a sign of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlso, checking if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. If it's not, then this could be malware. But assuming it's legitimate, the activity might be normal. However, the fact that there are multiple entries for different language packs might be part of a larger update or installation process.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other security events related to these files, like modifications or access attempts. But based solely on the file creation events, without additional context, it's hard to determine if this is malicious or not. It might be a false positive, or it might be part of normal operations. More information would be needed, but given the data here, it's not clearly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the creation of multiple JavaScript files (`*.js`) by `SDXHelper.exe` in the `Microsoft Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. These files are named with language codes (e.g., `es-mx`, `fr-ca`) and unique hashes (e.g., `6a32ba787ffa131e75557ad2d0b9d81e`). Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Location**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, often associated with managing add-ins, templates, or localized resources.\n   - The files are created in the `SolutionPackages` directory, which is typically used for storing Office add-ins, templates, or language-specific assets.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - The filenames suggest **language-specific UI string resources** (e.g., `es-mx-ui-strings`, `fi-fi-ui-strings`), which aligns with localization or internationalization efforts.\n   - The hash suffix (e.g., `6a32ba787ffa131e75557ad2d0b9d81e`) may represent checksums or version identifiers for the files.\n\n3. **Repetition**:\n   - The same files are logged multiple times (e.g., `es-mx-ui-strings...js` appears twice). This could indicate:\n     - **Redundant logging** (e.g., multiple sensors or tools detecting the same file creation).\n     - **Repeated file generation** (e.g., during an installation or update process).\n\n---\n\n### **Malicious Behavior Indicators?**\n- **No clear signs of malicious activity**:\n  - The process (`SDXHelper.exe`) is legitimate.\n  - The files are created in a standard Office directory.\n  - The filenames and structure align with expected Office resource management.\n\n- **Potential False Positives**:\n  - If the system is undergoing an **Office update or add-in installation**, this activity could be normal.\n  - The repetition of file creation events might be due to **logging inconsistencies** (e.g., multiple tools detecting the same file).\n\n- **Red Flags (if present)**:\n  - If the files were **modified or executed** (not just created), that could indicate malicious intent.\n  - If the hashes match known malicious files, further investigation would be needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Contextual Check**:\n   - Verify if the system is undergoing an **Office update, add-in installation, or localization configuration**. This activity could be part of a legitimate process.\n\n2. **File Analysis**:\n   - **Inspect the contents** of the created files (if accessible) to confirm they are legitimate UI strings or resources.\n   - Check if the files are **signed by Microsoft** or other trusted entities.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Look for **unusual patterns**, such as:\n     - Sudden spikes in file creation events.\n     - Files created in non-standard directories.\n     - Correlation with other suspicious activities (e.g., network connections, process injections).\n\n4. **Log Review**:\n   - Investigate why the same files are logged multiple times. This could indicate a **logging flaw** or **duplicate detection** by security tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe described activity is **likely legitimate**, assuming `SDXHelper.exe` is running as part of a normal Office process and the files are legitimate resources. However, **without additional context** (e.g., file contents, timestamps, correlation with other events), it is not possible to rule out a false positive or subtle anomaly. Further investigation into the files' contents and system context is recommended. \n\n**Final Verdict**: **Benign (Likely Legitimate)**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first thing I notice is that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like fr-fr-ui-strings-json with various hashes. Then there's a couple of entries from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in managing add-ins or something like that. The files being created in the SolutionPackages folder might be part of normal operations, like installing or updating add-ins. But wait, all these files have different language codes (fr, hi, he, etc.) and unique hashes. That could be normal if they're different language packs, but maybe there's something off here. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The process is legitimate, so maybe it's just routine.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe entry. Winlogbeat is a Beats agent used for collecting Windows events. The file it's creating is a .yml.new file, which might be a temporary file during configuration. But why is it in the Downloads folder? Typically, configuration files might be in a more standard location. However, if the user is manually setting up Winlogbeat, maybe they're placing it there. But the fact that it's a new file could be normal if they're editing the config.\n\nWait, but looking at the repetition of the SDXHelper.exe events, each with different files. Are they all legitimate? If the user is installing multiple language packs or add-ins, that's normal. But if there's a lot of these files being created in a short time, maybe it's suspicious. However, the logs don't show any errors or unusual activity. Also, the process is a known legitimate one.\n\nAnother thing: the hashes in the filenames are unique, which might be part of the file's identifier. If these are standard for the Office add-ins, then it's okay. But if they're random or don't match known hashes, that could be a red flag. But without knowing what the expected hashes are, I can't be sure.\n\nThe winlogbeat event seems less concerning. It's a single occurrence, and the process is legitimate. The .yml.new file might be a temporary file during configuration changes. Unless there's a security context, like if the user isn't expecting Winlogbeat to be running, but the question is about the logs themselves.\n\nPutting it all together, the SDXHelper events are likely part of normal Office operations, and the Winlogbeat event is a standard configuration activity. Unless there's more context indicating otherwise, like unusual timestamps, errors, or other processes involved, these logs don't show signs of malicious activity. Therefore, they might not be interesting for investigation unless there's a specific reason to suspect otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Benign\",\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"sdxhelper_exe_activity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory.\",\n      \"context\": \"SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office used for managing add-ins and language packs.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating various JavaScript files in different directories under \"SolutionPackages\". The first thing I notice is that all the files being created have the .js extension, which is common for JavaScript files. But the directories they're being placed in are named things like \"OfflineFiles\" and \"dist\", which might be part of a normal build or deployment process.\n\nNow, looking at the file names, they have a pattern: for example, \"icon_built_in_svg_icon_d92d9c61a31aac539c90417dbdb34416.js\" and similar ones. These look like they might be generated files, possibly from some kind of build tool that's compiling assets. The long strings in the filenames could be hashes or unique identifiers to prevent caching issues. That's pretty typical in web development when you want to ensure that when a file is updated, the browser fetches the new version.\n\nAnother thing is that the same files are being created multiple times. For instance, \"fabric.js\" appears twice in the logs, each time under the same directory. But wait, looking closer, the first occurrence is under \"SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" and the second under \"SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" again. Wait, no, actually, the first \"fabric.js\" is under \"SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" and the second under \"SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" again? Wait, no, looking again, the first \"fabric.js\" is under \"SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" and the second one is under the same path. Wait, no, the first two entries for \"fabric.js\" are in the same directory. So maybe the process is creating these files as part of a build step, and each entry is a separate event, perhaps each time a new file is generated.\n\nBut wait, the same file names are repeated. For example, \"icon_built_in_svg_icon_d92d9c61a31aac539c90417dbdb34416.js\" appears twice. But looking at the timestamps, if these were all happening at the same time, maybe it's just multiple files being created in the same directory. However, the logs don't show timestamps, so I can't tell the order. But the fact that the same file is being created multiple times might be a red flag. Unless it's part of a normal process where multiple files are generated, each with unique names.\n\nWait, but looking at the file names again, each one seems unique. The hash part of the filename is different each time. For example, \"d92d9c61a31aac539c90417dbdb34416\" vs \"93f17562456ea5a7ca5f9cddf1cd4b91\" vs \"2aeed3eeba26d3b9f77b14e9b2b3c5cd\" etc. So each of these is a different file. So maybe the process is generating a lot of these JavaScript files as part of a normal build or packaging process for an application, perhaps for a web app that uses icons and UI strings in multiple languages.\n\nThe directories mentioned, like \"OfflineFiles\" and \"dist\", are common in web development projects. \"dist\" is typically the distribution folder where built files are placed, and \"OfflineFiles\" might be part of a specific setup for offline use, maybe in a Progressive Web App (PWA) context. The presence of UI strings in different languages (like id-id, is-is) suggests that the application is internationalized, which is normal for enterprise applications.\n\nThe process \"SDXHelper.exe\" – I'm not immediately familiar with what that is. It might be a helper process for some software, perhaps related to Microsoft's tools given the context of SolutionPackages. But without more information, it's hard to say. However, if this is part of a legitimate software's build process, then these file creations are normal.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is suspicious. The key here is that all these files are being created by the same process, and the filenames are generated with unique hashes. If this is part of a legitimate build process, then it's normal. However, if the user is not expecting these files to be created, or if the process is not known to them, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nBut considering that the files are JavaScript, and the directories are part of a build process, it's more likely to be legitimate. However, in some cases, malware might generate files with random names to avoid detection. But the fact that the files are .js and in specific directories might still be part of a legitimate process.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be running a build tool or a development server, and these logs are part of the normal operation. For example, if they're using Webpack or another bundler that generates unique filenames for each build, this is standard behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, without more context about the environment, the user's system, or the nature of the process \"SDXHelper.exe\", it's hard to definitively say if this is malicious. However, based on the information given, the activity appears to be consistent with a normal build or packaging process, especially in a web development context. The presence of multiple .js files with unique hashes in specific directories is common in such scenarios. However, if the user is unsure about the legitimacy of the process or if these files are appearing in unexpected locations, further investigation would be warranted, such as checking the reputation of the process, reviewing the parent application, or using security tools to scan for potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe activity described in the logs appears to be consistent with a **normal build or packaging process**, particularly in a **web development context**. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and their implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Involved:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is the process generating the files. While the name is not widely known, it could be a legitimate helper tool for a software development environment (e.g., part of a build system, IDE, or deployment tool).\n\n2. **File Types and Patterns:**\n   - **JavaScript files (`.js`)** are being created. These are common in web development, especially for client-side code, icons, and internationalization (i18n) strings.\n   - **Unique filenames with hashes** (e.g., `d92d9c61a31aac539c90417dbdb34416.js`) suggest these files are generated to prevent caching issues, a common practice in build tools like Webpack or Vite.\n\n3. **Directories:**\n   - **`OfflineFiles`** and **`dist`** are typical in web development. `dist` is a standard folder for distribution builds, while `OfflineFiles` might relate to packaging assets for offline use (e.g., in a PWA).\n\n4. **Internationalization (i18n):**\n   - Filenames like `id-id` (Indonesian) and `is-is` (Icelandic) indicate the application is multilingual, which is normal for enterprise or global applications.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Activity Suspicious?**\n- **Likely Legitimate:**  \n  The activity aligns with standard practices in web development, such as:\n  - Compiling assets (e.g., icons, UI strings).\n  - Generating unique filenames for caching purposes.\n  - Packaging builds for deployment.\n\n- **Potential Red Flags (if applicable):**\n  - If **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a known or trusted process on your system.\n  - If the files are being created in **unusual locations** (e.g., outside of a project directory).\n  - If the system is **not running a development environment** (e.g., no related software like Visual Studio, WebStorm, or build tools).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify the Source of `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check the **file properties** (right-click > Properties > Details) to confirm the publisher and location.\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **VirusTotal** to scan the executable if unsure.\n\n2. **Review Build Tools:**\n   - If you're using a build tool (e.g., Webpack, Vite, MSBuild), this behavior is expected. Check the tool's documentation for similar output.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies:**\n   - If the process is **unrelated to your workflows** or **unexpected**, investigate further using system monitoring tools (e.g., Task Manager, Process Explorer).\n\n4. **Check for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan if you suspect the process might be malicious, especially if:\n     - Files are created in **non-standard directories**.\n     - The process consumes **unusual system resources** (CPU, memory).\n     - You see **unexpected network activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs describe behavior consistent with a **legitimate build or development process**, particularly in a web application context. However, if the process or files are **unrelated to your work** or **unexpected**, further investigation is warranted. Always ensure that any software generating such activity is **trusted and verified**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like \"it-it-ui-strings-json...\" and other language codes. These seem to be UI string files, maybe part of a normal Office installation or update. But why are there so many of them? Each file is created twice, but that might just be duplication in the logs. However, the process name SDXHelper.exe isn't one I recognize immediately. Typically, Office-related processes might have names like EXCEL.EXE or WINWORD.EXE, but SDXHelper.exe isn't standard. Maybe it's a legitimate helper tool, but I should check.\n\nThen there are events from EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes. That's normal for Excel, maybe connecting to some online services or updating settings. The svchost.exe entries are also common, as they host various system services. Their registry events could be part of normal system operations, but multiple registry changes might be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe key point here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If these files are part of a legitimate Office package, it's okay. But if SDXHelper.exe is a malicious process, creating numerous files in sensitive directories could be suspicious. However, the file paths are within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office, which is a common location for such files. Also, the filenames suggest they're UI strings, which might be part of a language pack or localization update.\n\nBut wait, why so many different language codes? That might indicate an attempt to install multiple language packs, which could be normal if the user is setting up Office for multiple regions. However, if this is happening without user consent, it might be malicious. However, the logs don't show any signs of malware, like unexpected network activity or unusual process behavior beyond the registry changes and file creations.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the presence of \"None\" task in one of the logs. That might be a log entry that's incomplete or not properly categorized. But it's just one entry, so maybe not significant.\n\nPutting it all together, while there's a lot of activity from SDXHelper.exe, the file paths and the nature of the files (UI strings) suggest they might be part of a legitimate Office installation or update. However, the unusual process name and the volume of file creations could warrant further investigation. But without additional suspicious indicators like malware signatures, unexpected network traffic, or user complaints, it's hard to label this as definitely malicious. So, the batch might be interesting for further analysis but not necessarily a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a mix of activities that could be benign or warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Pattern:** Repeated creation of `.js` files in the `Microsoft.Office.SolutionPackages` directory, with filenames suggesting localization\/UI string resources (e.g., `it-it-ui-strings-json...`, `km-kh-ui-strings-json...`).\n   - **Context:** These files may be part of a legitimate Office language pack or localization update. However, the process name `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft Office process (common Office processes include `EXCEL.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `OUTLOOK.EXE`). This could indicate a **custom or third-party tool**, which may be legitimate (e.g., a helper for add-ins) or suspicious (e.g., a dropper for malware).\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity:**\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE`** performing DNS queries and registry modifications: These could be normal (e.g., Excel connecting to cloud services or updating settings).\n   - **`svchost.exe`** registry events: Common for system services, but frequent changes to registry keys (especially if non-standard) may indicate **malicious configuration** (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n\n3. **Unusual Log Entry:**\n   - A log with `\"process\":null` and `\"task\":\"None\"` suggests a potential **incomplete or malformed log entry**, which could be an artifact or hint at obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe` Behavior:**\n  - The repeated creation of files in a non-standard location (`SolutionPackages`) with localization-specific names may indicate **unauthorized software deployment** or **malware masquerading as a legitimate tool**.\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known, signed Microsoft component, this could be a red flag.\n\n- **Registry Modifications:**\n  - While registry changes by `svchost.exe` are common, the absence of clear context (e.g., specific keys modified) makes it hard to assess risk. If these changes involve **critical system keys** (e.g., `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`), they could signal persistence.\n\n- **Lack of Malware Indicators:**\n  - No direct evidence of malware (e.g., network connections to C2 servers, process injection, or file execution) is present in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n  - Check if the process is legitimate (e.g., via file signature, digital certificate, or reputation databases like VirusTotal).\n  - Monitor for additional suspicious behavior (e.g., communication with external IPs, unexpected file modifications).\n\n- **Analyze Registry Changes:**\n  - Examine the specific registry keys modified by `svchhost.exe` and `EXCEL.EXE` to determine if they are benign or malicious.\n\n- **Audit File Creation:**\n  - Verify the purpose of the `.js` files in `SolutionPackages`. If they are not part of a known Office update, consider isolating the system for deeper analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **not definitively malicious**, but the combination of **unusual process names**, **repeated file creation**, and **registry modifications** warrants further investigation. This could be a **legitimate software update** or a **potential security incident** depending on the context of `SDXHelper.exe` and the nature of the registry changes."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first entry has null values for process and file, and the winlog task is \"None\". That might just be a placeholder or an error, not sure yet.\n\nThen there are two entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file path looks a bit odd with a long hash in the name. SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process; maybe it's part of some add-in or third-party software. Creating files in the Office SolutionPackages folder could be normal if it's part of an installation, but the name of the file seems suspicious. The hash in the filename might be an attempt to obfuscate the real purpose of the file.\n\nFollowing that, there are 25 entries all from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Excel normally doesn't modify the registry that much. Modifying registry values could be part of a malicious activity, like changing settings to persist after reboot or altering behavior. However, 25 instances in a short period might indicate something automated or a script running. \n\nPutting it all together: SDXHelper creating a suspicious file and Excel modifying the registry multiple times. These could be signs of an attack. The registry changes might be part of a larger malicious operation, such as configuring backdoors or disabling security features. The combination of unusual file creation and multiple registry modifications by a legitimate process (Excel) raises red flags.

However, the more concerning part is the SDXHelper.exe creating files. The file paths look like they're part of Office solution packages, which might be legitimate, but the filenames have a pattern that seems like language-specific UI strings. But wait, the filenames have hashes in them, like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json_e7dfbea71abb6781ead8c8671a96a5eb.js\". That hash part is unusual for normal UI files. Typically, you might expect version numbers or something more straightforward.\n\nAlso, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating these files multiple times in different subdirectories might indicate some kind of deployment or update activity. However, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, so maybe it's part of a legitimate update process. But the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and the creation of these hashed-named files could be suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate operation, but the repetition and the nature of the filenames make me think it might be something else. Maybe a malicious payload being deployed, using the SDXHelper process to drop files that look like legitimate ones but have malicious content. However, without more context, like checking the file contents or seeing if there are other suspicious activities, it's hard to say for sure. But the presence of multiple file creations with hashes in the names and the registry changes by Excel might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Excel.EXE Registry Modifications**\n- **Activity**: Multiple `Registry` events under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` (e.g., `Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\General`) with values like `LastUsed` and `LastUsedTime`.\n- **Likelihood**: **Legitimate**. Excel often updates registry keys during normal operations (e.g., tracking last used files, user preferences). However, **repetition** of these changes could warrant further scrutiny if tied to unexpected behavior (e.g., unauthorized access, malware persistence).\n\n---\n\n### **2. SDXHelper.EXE File Creation**\n- **Activity**: Repeated creation of `.js` files in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...` with filenames like:\n  - `transcription-strings.min.js` (legitimate-looking)\n  - `lt-lt-ui-strings-json_a236047ac26d450f8f9ef3a3fab9a39b.js` (hash in filename)\n- **Key Concerns**:\n  - **Hashed Filenames**: Unusual for standard UI\/resource files. Legitimate files typically use version numbers or language codes (e.g., `en-US`, `es-ES`), not cryptographic hashes.\n  - **Volume of Files**: Over 20 files created across multiple subdirectories. While SDXHelper.EXE is a **Microsoft Office utility** (used for add-in deployment), this scale of activity may indicate:\n    - **Malicious Use**: Potential for **dropping payloads** (e.g., malicious scripts, backdoors) disguised as legitimate Office resources.\n    - **Tampering**: Unauthorized modification of Office solution packages.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Threat Indicators**\n- **Unusual File Paths**: Files are stored in `SolutionPackages`, a directory typically used for **Office add-ins**. If these files are **not part of a known add-in**, this could signal **malware**.\n- **SDXHelper.EXE Behavior**: While legitimate, this process can be **exploited** (e.g., by malware to execute arbitrary code). Ensure the process is **signed by Microsoft** and running from the expected location (`C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\...`).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Check File Integrity**:\n  - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **VirusTotal** to scan the created `.js` files.\n  - Verify hashes against known good files (if available).\n- **Monitor SDXHelper.EXE**:\n  - Use **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to capture its behavior during file creation.\n  - Check if it communicates with external IPs or writes to unexpected locations.\n- **Review Registry Changes**:\n  - Correlate Excel's registry modifications with user activity. Are they tied to **unexpected file operations** or **network requests**?\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **not definitively malicious**, but the **hashed filenames** and **high volume of file creations** by SDXHelper.EXE are **red flags**. Further investigation is required to confirm legitimacy. If these files are **unrelated to known Office add-ins**, they may indicate **malware** leveraging trusted processes for persistence."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The file names seem to be language-specific UI string files, like mi-mi, mr-in, etc. That's a lot of files being created, but are they normal?\n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe—what's that? I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I remember, Microsoft Office might use such helpers for updates or language packs. But creating so many files in the SolutionPackages folder might be unusual. However, the filenames follow a pattern that looks like localization files, which could be part of a legitimate update or installation.\n\nBut there's also one entry where a registry key is modified by svchost.exe, which is a common host process for Windows services. The key is HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\LanguageResources. Modifying this could relate to language settings, which might be part of installing language packs. However, if this is done without user consent, it could be malicious.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the events are from the same batch. Are there any other suspicious activities? Let me check again. The other events are all file creations by SDXHelper.exe. If these are part of a legitimate Office update, it's normal. But if the files are malicious, maybe they're being injected there.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the presence of multiple language-specific files might indicate an attempt to install multiple language packs, which is normal. But if the files are not part of any known update or if the process is not legitimate, that's a red flag.\n\nHowever, the user hasn't provided any other events like network activity or process creations. The only other event is the registry modification. Since svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but it's modifying a registry key related to Office language resources. If that's part of an update, it's okay. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut considering that the files are created in the SolutionPackages directory, which is used by Office for updates, this might be a legitimate activity. However, the high number of files and the specific naming could also be a sign of something else. Maybe a malware dropper using language files as a disguise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is installing multiple language packs for Office, which would explain the files. But the registry change might be part of that installation. However, I need to check if such installations typically involve these actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these activities could be legitimate, the combination of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe and a registry modification by svchost.exe might warrant further investigation. There's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent, but the pattern is suspicious enough to be considered interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents a mix of potentially legitimate and suspicious activities, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Pattern:** Multiple files (e.g., `xx-xx-ui-strings-json_...js`) are created in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory by **SDXHelper.exe**. These files appear to be language-specific UI resource files (e.g., `mi-mi`, `mr-in`, `ms-my`).\n   - **Legitimacy:** While `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft process, it could be associated with third-party software or Office add-ins. The file naming and location might align with **Office language pack installations** or **customization tools**, but this is not definitively confirmed.\n\n2. **Registry Modification by svchost.exe:**\n   - A registry key (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\LanguageResources`) is modified by **svchost.exe** (a legitimate Windows process). This change could relate to **language resource configuration**, but the lack of context (e.g., user action, installation logs) makes it unclear whether this is part of a legitimate update or a covert activity.\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators:**\n- **Unusual Process Behavior:** The repeated creation of language-specific files by `SDXHelper.exe` without clear user interaction or documentation of such activity raises concerns. Legitimate Office updates typically do not involve creating hundreds of files in the `SolutionPackages` directory.\n- **Lack of Context:** No logs indicate user-initiated actions (e.g., installation, update) or approvals for these changes. This absence of context could signal **malicious activity** (e.g., dropper behavior, persistence mechanisms).\n- **Registry Change:** While modifying the registry is common during software installation, the specific key and lack of correlation with known Office processes merit scrutiny.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional events (e.g., network traffic, process execution, user activity) that might contextualize these changes.\n- **Analyze File Contents:** Inspect the created `.js` files for malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n- **Verify Process Legitimacy:** Confirm whether `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a known, trusted application or if it is associated with malware (e.g., via reputation databases or sandbox analysis).\n- **Monitor for Persistence:** Investigate if the registry change or file creation is linked to persistence mechanisms (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry run keys).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities (e.g., language resource updates) could be legitimate, the **unusual volume of files**, **lack of user context**, and **atypical process behavior** make this batch **notably suspicious**. Further investigation is warranted to rule out malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All three entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are in the OfflineFiles directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The file names end with ui-strings-json and have different hashes. \n\nFirst, I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Office solution, so it's probably legitimate. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the OfflineFiles folder might be normal, especially if they're part of a package deployment.\n\nBut wait, the same file is listed twice in the second and third entries. That might be a duplication, but maybe it's just a log repetition. The paths are all within the user's AppData folder, which is common for temporary or local storage. \n\nI should consider if there's any suspicious activity. The process is legitimate, and the files are in expected locations. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names could indicate a potential issue if they're not supposed to be there. But since the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, it's more likely that these are part of a normal package installation or update.\n\nNo signs of malware, like unexpected processes or unusual file types. The justification is that the files are created by a legitimate process in a typical location. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because there's no malicious behavior detected here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe (part of Microsoft Office) in expected user-specific temporary directories.
