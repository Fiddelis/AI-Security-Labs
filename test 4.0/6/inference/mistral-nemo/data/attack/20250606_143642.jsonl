{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the events:\n\n1. **Initial Infection:**\n   - `explorer.exe` ( likely due to a malicious document or phishing link) loads a DLL from `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\temp.dll`.\n   - `services.exe` accesses the registry, potentially writing malicious values.\n\n2. **Execution of Malicious Code:**\n   - `sppsvc.exe` (a legitimate Windows process) loads `taskschd.dll`, which might contain malicious code.\n   - `powershell.exe` is accessed multiple times, indicating the use of PowerShell for further actions.\n   - `whoami.exe` is created, suggesting an attempt to gather system information.\n\n3. **File Deletion:**\n   - A file `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` is created and immediately deleted using PowerShell.\n   - This could be a script used for further malicious activities or cleanup after execution.\n\n4. **DLL Loading:**\n   - Several DLLs are loaded by `powershell.exe`, which might include malicious libraries:\n     - `mscoree.dll`\n     - `mscoreei.dll`\n     - `clr.dll`\n     - `mscorlib.ni.dll`\n     - `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`\n     - `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component, potentially loaded for evasion purposes)\n\nHere are some observations and potential indicators of compromise:\n\n- The use of PowerShell for execution might indicate a malware strain like Powelick or QakBot.\n- The file deletion event suggests an attempt to hide the script used for further activities.\n- The loading of multiple DLLs could indicate packing or evasive techniques used by the malware."}
