Each file name appears to be unique and seems to contain a hash or an identifier.\n\n**Potential Threat Indicators:**\n\n1. **Repeated File Creation Events:** The sheer number of files created in rapid succession could indicate unwanted behavior, such as malware attempting to spread itself or encrypt files.\n2. **JavaScript Files in Office Directory:** JavaScript files are not typically associated with Microsoft Office applications. Their presence could suggest the installation of unauthorized add-ins or scripts.\n3. **Unique File Names:** The seemingly random nature of the file names might indicate that these are not standard, legitimate files but rather uniquely named files created by an unknown process.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Investigate Further:** Since these logs represent a series of events happening rapidly (within a short period), it's crucial to investigate this further to determine if there is indeed malicious activity occurring.\n2. **Scan for Malware:** Run a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus software to check for any potential malware infections that could be causing this behavior.\n3. **Check for Unauthorized Add-ins\/Extensions:** Review the list of active add-ins and extensions in Microsoft Office applications to see if there are any unauthorized ones installed.\n4. **Monitor Process Behavior:** Keep an eye on the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process and its activities to see if it continues to behave suspiciously or causes further unusual events.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nIf this activity proves to be malicious, appropriate actions such as isolating affected systems, removing the offending process\/software, and informing other potentially affected parties should be taken.
