The hash in the filename suggests that these could be versioned or unique instances of the file.\n\n2. **Process Name:** All events are triggered by the same process, \"SDXHelper.exe\". This suggests that this process is responsible for creating these files.\n\n3. **Number of Events:** There are 17 identical events in a row, which implies that the process is running in a loop or repeatedly performing the same action without any change in its behavior or the files it's handling.\n\n4. **Lack of Timestamps:** Since there are no timestamps or time-related fields in these objects, we cannot determine when each event occurred or how much time elapsed between consecutive events."}
