However, frequent file creation by a specific process (`SDXHelper.exe`) should be monitored.\n\n**Process Information:**\n- The process `SDXHelper.exe` is responsible for creating multiple files in two different directories:\n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`\n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`\n\n- The files created are JavaScript files (.js) with names like `word-copilot.min_XXXXXX.js` and `officeaicopilot-strings.min_XXXXXX.js`, where `XXXXXX` is a hexadecimal string.\n\n**File Creation Timeline:**\n- The file creation events started at approximately 15:38:42 (based on the first log) and ended at around 15:39:07 (based on the last log).\n- There were a total of 16 files created during this period, with an interval of about 2 seconds between each creation event.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Identify the purpose and legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` to better understand why it's creating these JavaScript files.\n2. Monitor the behavior of `SDXHelper.exe` for any unusual activities, such as excessive file creation or unexpected file modification\/deletion.\n3. Keep your system and software up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against potential vulnerabilities.\n4. Regularly backup important data to minimize data loss in case of an incident.\n\nAgain, based solely on the provided logs, there is no immediate threat detected. However, it's essential to investigate the cause behind these frequent file creation events to ensure that it's not a malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON-like data, which seems to log file creation events by a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", here's how we could analyze and present this information:\n\n1. **Process Information:**\n   - Process Name: SDXHelper.exe\n\n2. **File Creation Events:**\n   I've grouped the files created based on their names (excluding hashes) for better readability:\n\n   - `word-copilot.min.js` (5 occurrences)\n     - Hashes: `1e3de1f2`, `286b5a68`, `1e3de1f2`, `286b5a68`\n     - Creation Time (assuming the order of events is chronological):\n       - First occurrence: Not specified in the given data.\n       - Last occurrence: Not specified in the given data.\n\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` (7 occurrences)\n     - Hashes: `e1dc56e1`, `e2ad352a`, `e1dc56e1`, `e2ad352a`\n     - Creation Time:\n       - First occurrence: Not specified in the given data.\n       - Last occurrence: Not specified in the given data.\n\n3. **Summary:**\n   The process SDXHelper.exe created a total of 12 files (5 unique occurrences of word-copilot.min.js and 7 unique occurrences of officeaicopilot-strings.min.js). However, without timestamps or more specific context, it's challenging to determine the exact creation times or any other relevant details such as file sizes or locations."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"**Analysis:**\n\nAll the events logged are file creations triggered by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files created are JavaScript files (with .js extensions) related to Office AI copilot and word copilot, suggesting some kind of activity or update involving these components.\n\n**Justification:**\n\nAs the same process (\"SDXHelper.exe\") is creating multiple instances of the same type of files (JavaScript files), it's likely that this process is responsible for generating or updating these scripts, possibly as part of a regular maintenance task or an upgrade process. The repetition of file hashes suggests that these are identical files being created or overwritten.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe consistency in the process name, file type, and the repetitive nature of the file hashes provide strong evidence for this justification. However, without more context about \"SDXHelper.exe\" or the office AI copilot, it's not possible to provide a 100% certain justification.\n\n**Additional Information Needed:**\n\nMore information about the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process and its role within Microsoft Office would be beneficial to provide a more detailed justification. Also, understanding when and how these files are used could help clarify why there are so many instances of them being created."}
