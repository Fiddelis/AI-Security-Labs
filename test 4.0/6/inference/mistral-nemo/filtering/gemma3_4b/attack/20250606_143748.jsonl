A PowerShell process with the `WinPwn.ps1` execution command.\n     2. No process data, but 'User Account Management' winlog task present (suggesting user account manipulation).\n   - Timeline: Not specified in the given logs.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Block or monitor the GitHub URL used for script download to prevent future attacks.\n- Look into any changes made to user accounts during the time of these events.\n- Scan the system for signs of compromise, such as additional malware or backdoors created by `WinPwn`.\n- Strengthen login security and consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) if not already implemented."}
