This service was started automatically after creation. The actions performed by this service are not clear from the logs provided, but they might indicate a potential threat or malicious activity. Further investigation is recommended to determine the purpose and origin of the `tarefa_logico.exe` file.\n\nAs always, it's essential to monitor your system for any unusual or unauthorized activities and take appropriate measures to secure your environment."}
