{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON logs, here's a summary of the activities:\n\n1. **Process Creation (Rule: ProcessCreate)**:\n   - A PowerShell process was created with the command line:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n\n2. **Provider Lifecycle (x3)**:\n   - Three events were logged for the Provider Lifecycle task, indicating that some action was taken on a service provider.\n   - The PowerShell command executed in each event is the same as the one mentioned above.\n\nFrom these logs, we can infer that an attempt was made to create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. This service points to an executable file located at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. The command also tries to start the newly created service immediately.\n\nHowever, there's no indication in the logs whether the service creation and startup were successful or not. Also, it's important to note that creating a new Windows service requires appropriate permissions, so if the operation was unsuccessful, it might be due to lack of sufficient privileges.\n\nHere are some potential threats or risks associated with this activity:\n\n- **Persistence**: If the service is created successfully, it can run persistently even after system restarts.\n- **Remote Access**: If the executable file `tarefa_logico.exe` contains malicious code, it could provide attackers with remote access to the affected machine.\n- **Evasion Techniques**: Using PowerShell to create a service could be an evasion technique to bypass security measures that might be in place for direct service creation using sc.exe or other tools.\n\nTo investigate further, you should:\n\n1. Check if the \"objeto_ativo\" service was created successfully and if it's running.\n2. Analyze the `tarefa_logico.exe` file for any malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n3. Review user permissions to determine who has the authority to create new Windows services on the affected machine.\n4. Monitor PowerShell activities on the system to detect similar anomalous behaviors."}
