Here are the key points:\n\n- The file was detected as malicious by DrWeb, which identified it as `Trojan.Generic.1897045`.\n- No other antivirus engine detected the file.\n- The scan ID is `2233445678`, and a total of 82 scans were performed.\n\nThe Winlogbeat event indicates that there was an attempt to create a new process, which triggered the \"Process Create\" rule. However, without additional context or further investigation, it's difficult to determine if this attempted process creation is related to the malicious file detected by DrWeb."}
