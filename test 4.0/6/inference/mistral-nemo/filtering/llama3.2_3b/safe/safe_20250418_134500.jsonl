Here's the sequence of events:\n\n- The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process was started.\n- It created a new file (an installer for the update) in the Download folder.\n- A second instance of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was started.\n- This second process created another file (`setup.exe`) in the Install folder, likely to start or manage the installation process.\n\nThese logs suggest that Microsoft Edge was being updated to version 135.0.3179.73, and the update files were placed in the `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate` directory. The `setup.exe` file seems to be responsible for managing or starting the actual installation process."}
