This could be normal behavior, but it might also indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.\n   - No related file was loaded or accessed during this event.\n\n3. **Command and Control:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process was created multiple times with various activities:\n     1. Accessed another process (`whoami.exe`), which is used to display the current user's security context. This could indicate information gathering.\n     2. Set a registry value (可能是为了持久化或配置一些东西), although the specific registry path or key isn't provided in this log snippet.\n     3. Removed all files from the `%TEMP%` directory with the name `entrada_principal.zip`. This could indicate an attempt to hide evidence of initial access or delivery of malicious payload.\n   - Loaded `.NET` related DLLs (`mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll`), which suggests that it might be executing .NET-based malware.\n\n4. **Lateral Movement\/Execution:**\n   - No clear signs of lateral movement were observed in the provided logs, but continued monitoring is recommended to detect any further suspicious activities.\n\nTo investigate this threat further:\n\n- Enable advanced logging and monitoring tools to capture more detailed information about these processes and their activities.\n- Review the full command lines used by `powershell.exe` processes to understand their exact intentions.\n- Analyze the registry modifications made by `svchost.exe` and `powershell.exe`.\n- Monitor for any new files created or modified in `%TEMP%`, as well as other directories where malicious payloads might be dropped."}
