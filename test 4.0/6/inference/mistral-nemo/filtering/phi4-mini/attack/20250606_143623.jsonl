They're also repeatedly trying to start this service. The registry event suggests they might be modifying registry keys as well.\n\nThe final command writing the host indicates that the operation was likely successful (`Final result: 1`).\n\nTo mitigate this threat, you should:\n- Disable the created service.\n- Remove any malicious files in the `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin` directory.\n- Scan your system for malware using up-to-date antivirus software.\n- Consider using application whitelisting to prevent similar incidents in the future."}
