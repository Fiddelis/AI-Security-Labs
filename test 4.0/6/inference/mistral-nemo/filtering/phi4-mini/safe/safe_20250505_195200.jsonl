The common fields are:\n\n- `process`: This field consistently indicates that the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\".\n- `winlog`: This field shows that the task performed by the process is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".\n- `file`: This field provides information about the file created, which includes its path and a unique identifier consisting of hexadecimal characters.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1. The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" suggests that it might be related to software development or data exchange.\n2. The task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" indicates that the process is creating files on the system.\n3. The file paths are all located in the same directory, suggesting that this activity is focused and not scattered across different locations.\n4. The unique identifiers appear to be hashes, possibly SHA-1 or similar, based on their length (40 characters). These could represent distinct versions or variations of the files being created.\n\n**Potential Issue:**\n\nWithout more context or further investigation, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact issue. However, repetitive file creation activities by a non-standard process might indicate unwanted behavior, such as:\n\n- Malware: The process could be part of a malware trying to create files for its operation or spread.\n- Misconfigured software: The software using \"SDXHelper.exe\" might be misconfigured and creating unnecessary files.\n- Resource exhaustion: If the creation of these files is resource-intensive, it could lead to system slowdowns or other issues.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo understand this behavior better:\n\n1. Check if the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate part of any known software installed on the system.\n2. Monitor its activity for a longer period to see if there are any patterns or if it changes over time.\n3. If possible, examine the contents of these created files to understand their purpose and potential impact on the system.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\nBased solely on this data, it's difficult to classify this as benign or malicious. Further investigation is required for a more definitive conclusion."}

There are significantly more events for the OfficeAICopilot-strings.min files compared to Word-copilot.min files (24 vs 4).\n3. The file hashes (MD5, SHA-1, etc.) seem to change with each event, suggesting that either the contents of these files or their metadata might be dynamic.\n4. Since these events are related to file creation, it implies that SDXHelper.exe is generating these minified JavaScript files dynamically.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n\nWhile this behavior isn't necessarily malicious, creating and constantly updating multiple JavaScript files could potentially pose security risks if the process is not properly validated or controlled:\n\n- If the contents of these files are dynamic, there's a risk that they might contain malicious code.\n- The creation of many files in a single directory could lead to performance issues due to excessive I\/O operations."}
