{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary and my analysis:\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Most events are related to the process `SDXHelper.exe`, which is creating files in the same directory repeatedly.\n- There's one event involving `chrome.exe` setting a registry value.\n- The created files all have similar names with different hashes, suggesting they might be updates or variations of the same file.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **File creation events by SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is creating multiple instances of a JavaScript file (`officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) with varying hashes. This could indicate that the application is updating its script files repeatedly, possibly due to an infinite loop or a faulty update mechanism.\n   - The fact that these events are occurring in quick succession (within minutes) suggests that there might be an issue with the application's behavior.\n\n2. **Registry value set event by chrome.exe:**\n   - This event indicates that Google Chrome has set or modified a registry value. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is normal behavior or indicative of an issue.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Investigate the cause for `SDXHelper.exe` creating multiple instances of the same file repeatedly. This could be due to an error in the application logic, a malfunctioning update mechanism, or even malware.\n- Monitor the system and other applications running on it to see if there are any other unusual behaviors or events happening concurrently with these file creation events.\n- Consider reaching out to Microsoft support (if `SDXHelper.exe` is part of Microsoft Office) or the application's developer for further assistance in resolving this issue."}
