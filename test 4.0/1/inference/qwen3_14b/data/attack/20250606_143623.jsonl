{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess task. Not too suspicious yet. Then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a normal command to check user identity. But then there's another powershell.exe with a registry value set. Hmm, that might be part of some configuration change.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell command that creates a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to a .exe file in a non-standard path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That path doesn't look like a typical system directory. Creating a service with a custom executable could be a red flag. The command is using New-Service and Start-Service, which are PowerShell cmdlets. This might be an attempt to install a backdoor or malicious service.\n\nThen, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, but the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be part of legitimate processes, but I need to check if they're being used in an unusual way.\n\nNext, a file is created in the Temp directory with a name that looks like a script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. Then it's immediately deleted. That could be an indicator of an attacker executing a script and then cleaning up traces. The fact that it's in the Temp folder and deleted quickly is suspicious.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value set events from services.exe. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's modifying registry values, that might not be normal. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable path, the use of PowerShell to execute commands that modify the registry and create services, the temporary script file creation and deletion, and the loading of various DLLs. These actions could indicate a malicious process trying to establish persistence on the system. The presence of multiple PowerShell events and the suspicious service creation are strong indicators. However, I should consider if any of these could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating a service might be part of a legitimate script. But the combination of events, especially the service creation from a non-standard path and the temporary script, makes me lean towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands, including creating a new service with a non-standard path (C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe) and loading unusual DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events.\n\nStarting with the first entry: services.exe has a registry value set. That's normal, as services.exe is a legitimate Windows process. Then there's tarefa_logico.exe loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. These are standard for .NET applications, so maybe part of a legitimate program. But wait, tarefa_logico.exe isn't a standard Windows process. That name seems suspicious. Maybe it's a typo or a malicious executable.\n\nLooking at the next entries, powershell.exe creates a file in the user's AppData directory. Creating a startup profile is normal, but the other registry changes by services.exe and svchost.exe are repeated multiple times. However, services.exe and svchost.exe are legitimate, so those might be normal operations. The MsMpEng.exe (Microsoft Malware Protection Engine) changing registry values is also normal for antivirus activities.\n\nBut the repeated registry changes by services.exe might be a red flag. However, services.exe is a core Windows process, so maybe it's just doing its job. The tarefa_logico.exe loading .NET DLLs could be part of a legitimate application, but the name is unusual. Also, there's a file created by a process named None, which might be an error in logging or an unknown process.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of tarefa_logico.exe loading .NET DLLs and the unusual process name could be suspicious. However, without more context, like network activity or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain. The other events seem normal. So I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence, as there are some unusual elements that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading .NET Framework DLLs (mscoree.dll, clr.dll) suggest potential malicious activity, as this process name is not standard and may indicate a dropper or loader.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first 12 entries, they're all about svchost.exe performing registry value sets. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if it's modifying the registry, that's not necessarily bad on its own. But when you see multiple instances of the same process doing the same action repeatedly, that might be a red flag. However, I should check if there's any context here. Since all these events are the same, maybe it's a normal system update or configuration change. But without more info, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. But maybe there's something else in the logs.\n\nThen, looking further down, there are several entries from setup.exe creating files. The files are all related to Microsoft Edge, like msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others. The paths are in the Program Files directory, which is typical for installed software. However, setup.exe is usually part of an installation process. But creating multiple executable files in a directory that's part of an Edge installation might be part of a legitimate update. However, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here. Also, there's an entry where setup.exe loads taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows DLL related to Task Scheduler. That seems normal.\n\nWait, but the first part with svchost.exe modifying the registry multiple times might be related to some configuration changes. However, if that's part of a legitimate process, like a system update, it might not be a problem. But if the registry changes are to keys that are not typically modified by svchost.exe, that could be suspicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed. So that's a bit of a blind spot.\n\nAnother thing to note is that setup.exe is creating multiple files in the EdgeCore directory. If this is part of a legitimate installation or update, that's okay. But if setup.exe is not supposed to be running or if the files are being created in an unusual location, that could be a problem. However, the paths mentioned are standard for Microsoft Edge installations.\n\nBut wait, there's also an entry where setup.exe creates a batch file named show_third_party_software_licenses.bat. That seems a bit odd. Typically, software might have a license agreement, but creating a batch file to show third-party licenses might be part of the installation process. However, if that batch file is being used to execute malicious code, that could be a problem. But again, without seeing the content of the batch file, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The svchost.exe events are repetitive and might indicate some registry changes, but without more context, they could be normal. The setup.exe events are creating files related to Microsoft Edge, which could be part of an installation or update. However, the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes might be part of a larger process. However, since all the events are related to legitimate processes (svchost.exe and setup.exe) and the files are in standard locations, this might not be malicious. But the repetition of the same event multiple times could indicate something automated or part of a script. However, given that setup.exe is involved in creating multiple files during installation, it's possible that this is a legitimate activity. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation. But I need to be careful here. If all these events are part of a normal installation, then it's not interesting. But if the setup.exe is not supposed to be running or if the registry changes are abnormal, then it would be. Since the logs don't provide enough detail on the specific registry keys or the context of the setup.exe activity, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the presence of multiple legitimate processes doing their normal functions might not be suspicious. Therefore, the answer would be that it's not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events described does not appear to be suspicious or warrant investigation for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Legitimate Processes Involved**:  \n   - **`svchost.exe`** is a standard Windows system process that hosts various services. Registry modifications by `svchost.exe` are common during system updates or configuration changes, though the specific keys modified are not provided here. Without additional context (e.g., unusual keys, unauthorized changes), these events align with normal system behavior.  \n   - **`setup.exe`** is frequently used during software installations or updates. The files created (e.g., `msedge.exe`, `msedgewebview2.exe`) are legitimate components of Microsoft Edge, and their paths (`C:\\Program Files\\...`) are standard for installed software.  \n\n2. **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:  \n   - The logs do not include suspicious activity such as:  \n     - Unusual registry keys being modified.  \n     - File creation in non-standard or unexpected locations.  \n     - Execution of malicious payloads (e.g., unknown DLLs, suspicious batch scripts).  \n   - The batch file `show_third_party_software_licenses.bat` is plausible for a legitimate software installation process (e.g., displaying license agreements).  \n\n3. **Contextual Normality**:  \n   - The repetitive `svchost.exe` registry events and `setup.exe` file creations may reflect a system update or software installation, which is a routine activity.  \n   - The involvement of `taskschd.dll` (a legitimate Task Scheduler component) further supports the possibility of a standard system process.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The events described are consistent with normal system and software installation behavior. No clear signs of malicious activity or anomalies are present. **This batch is not interesting for investigation** unless additional context (e.g., unexpected registry keys, unauthorized processes, or network activity) is available."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events here are related to registry changes by processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. Registry modifications can be normal, but when they're frequent or involve certain keys, they might indicate something malicious. However, the majority of these are just standard registry value sets or object additions\/deletions. \n\nThen, looking at the file creation events. There are a few files created by setup.exe. The paths mentioned are under Microsoft Edge's Application directory, like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe. These could be legitimate files if they're part of a legitimate installation. However, the presence of these files might also be part of a malicious installation if they're not supposed to be there. \n\nAnother thing to note is that setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. If this is part of a legitimate software installation, these events are normal. But if the setup.exe isn't from a trusted source, or if these files are being created in unusual locations, that's a red flag. \n\nHowever, in the given data, all the file paths mentioned are under standard directories for Microsoft Edge. The creation of .lnk files in the Start Menu and Quick Launch are typical for application shortcuts. The other files like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe are also legitimate components of Microsoft Edge. \n\nSo, considering all these events together, they seem to be part of a normal installation or update process of Microsoft Edge. There's no indication of malicious activity here. The confidence is medium because while the events are normal, the high number of registry changes might be concerning, but since the files involved are legitimate, it's more likely a benign activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show standard registry modifications and file creations related to Microsoft Edge installation\/updates. Processes involved (svchost.exe, services.exe, setup.exe) are legitimate system components.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are related to 'setup.exe' performing registry operations. There are multiple instances of 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' events. Then there are some 'Pipe Created' events also linked to 'setup.exe'. Then, later on, there are several 'File created' events by 'svchost.exe' in the Windows Temp directory, with filenames that look like APPX followed by random strings. One of the files is in 'AppReadiness' under S-1-5-18, which might be a system account.\n\nHmm. Now, 'setup.exe' is a legitimate process, often associated with installation or setup tasks. However, repeated registry modifications and pipe creations could be suspicious, especially if they're part of an installation that's not expected. But on the other hand, during software installation, these activities are normal. However, the fact that there are so many registry changes might indicate something more than a standard setup.\n\nThen there's the 'svchost.exe' creating a bunch of temporary files in the Windows Temp directory. That's common for system processes, but the filenames with APPX might be related to Windows updates or app installations. However, the presence of multiple such files could indicate a large number of installations or possibly malicious activity, like droppers or installers for malware. Also, the AppReadiness directory is used by Windows for preparing the system for applications, so a file there might be part of that process. But if it's being written to by svchost.exe, that could be normal or not, depending on context.\n\nWait, but the key here is that all these events are from different processes. The setup.exe is doing registry and pipe operations, and svchost.exe is creating files. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate host process for Windows services, so creating temporary files could be part of normal operations. However, the high number of files might be a red flag.\n\nBut the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The justification needs to be concise. So, the main points here are: repeated registry changes by setup.exe, which might be part of an installation, but combined with the creation of many temp files by svchost.exe, which could be part of a larger process. However, without more context, like the source of setup.exe, or the nature of the files, it's hard to say. But the combination of these events could be indicative of an installation or update process. However, if setup.exe is not a known legitimate process, that's a problem. But since the user hasn't provided more info, I have to assume the process names are as given.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple registry modifications and file creations might be part of a legitimate software deployment. However, the high volume of events might be unusual. But given that the user hasn't provided any other indicators of compromise, like unexpected network activity or unusual process behavior, it's possible that this is just a normal setup. However, the fact that all these events are grouped together might suggest that something is happening, like a malware installation that's modifying the registry and creating files. But again, without more info, it's tricky.\n\nIn cybersecurity, high volume of registry changes and file creation in temp directories can be suspicious. So, the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a combination of registry modifications and file creation that might be part of an installation or could be malicious. The confidence would be medium, maybe 0.6 or 0.7. The justification would be that multiple registry changes and file creations by setup.exe and svchost.exe could indicate an installation or potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **multiple registry modifications** by `setup.exe` and **numerous temporary file creations** by `svchost.exe` in the Windows Temp directory. While `setup.exe` and `svchost.exe` are legitimate processes, the **high volume of registry changes** and **unusual file naming patterns** (e.g., `APPX.*` files) could indicate an installation or update process, or potentially **malicious activity** (e.g., dropper behavior). The lack of clear context (e.g., source of `setup.exe`, purpose of files) raises suspicion, warranting further investigation.\n\n**Classification:** `INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence:** 0.7  \n**Justification:** The combination of frequent registry operations, temporary file creation, and the use of `APPX`-named files may indicate legitimate software deployment or a potential security threat."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple file creation events by svchost.exe. The files are in the WindowsApps directory, specifically EdgeGameAssist.exe. That's part of Microsoft Edge's Game Assist feature. But wait, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but creating files in WindowsApps might be normal for some installations. However, I should check if this is a known legitimate activity or if it's suspicious.\n\nThen there are several entries where svchost.exe creates files in the AppReadiness folder with paths that look like security identifiers (SIDs). Those SIDs are part of the system's security setup, but creating files there might be unusual. The repetition of the same file path multiple times could indicate something like a failed attempt or a loop, which might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are registry value set events by svchost.exe. Multiple times, which could be normal if it's part of a service startup, but again, the repetition might be suspicious. Then there's a RuntimeBroker.exe also setting registry values. RuntimeBroker is associated with UWP apps, so maybe related to the EdgeGameAssist.exe mentioned earlier.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's just writing a host message. That seems benign, but the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the default. However, the subsequent image load events for PowerShell loading various .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc., are normal for PowerShell operations. But the presence of System.Management.Automation.ni.dll might be part of normal PowerShell execution.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main points are:\n\n1. svchost.exe creating files in AppReadiness with SIDs. That's unusual because AppReadiness is involved in preparing applications for execution, but creating files with SIDs might be related to user-specific configurations. However, svchost hosting services that interact with the registry and file system could be legitimate, but the repetition of the same file path might indicate an issue.\n\n2. The EdgeGameAssist.exe file is created. If this is a legitimate part of Edge's installation, then it's okay. But if it's not, that's a problem. However, the presence of that file in WindowsApps might be part of a package installation.\n\n3. The PowerShell events are normal unless there's something else. The command line here is harmless, but the image loads are standard for PowerShell.\n\nConsidering all that, the most suspicious part is the repeated file creation in AppReadiness with the same SIDs. That might be a sign of a failed attempt to modify the registry or install something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the repeated events and the specific file paths might warrant further look into. But I need to check if these are known legitimate activities. For example, during system updates or app installations, svchost might create such files. However, the repetition could be a sign of a problem. Alternatively, it could be a benign process. \n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple registry writes by svchost and RuntimeBroker. If those are part of a legitimate service, then it's okay. But if they're modifying critical registry keys, that's suspicious. However, the logs don't show which keys are being modified, just that a value is set. So that's a bit ambiguous.\n\nOverall, while there are some unusual activities, they might be part of normal system operations. However, the repetition and the specific paths could be indicators of something worth investigating further. So, the answer would be that this is interesting enough to warrant further analysis, but not necessarily a clear-cut threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious patterns that merit further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **svchost.exe File Creation in `AppReadiness`**:\n   - **Suspicious Pattern**: Repeated creation of files with paths containing **SIDs (Security Identifiers)** (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\...\\S-1-5-21-...`). While `AppReadiness` is involved in application preparation, creating files with SIDs is **unusual** and could indicate **attempts to manipulate system-specific configurations** or **malicious persistence**.\n   - **Context**: This might be related to legitimate system processes (e.g., during updates or app installations), but the **repetition** of the same file path raises concerns.\n\n2. **EdgeGameAssist.exe in `WindowsApps`**:\n   - **Legitimate?**: The file `EdgeGameAssist.exe` is part of **Microsoft Edge's Game Assist feature** (a known component). However, its presence in `WindowsApps` (a directory for UWP apps) is typical for installations. **No immediate red flags** here unless further anomalies are present.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe**:\n   - **svchost.exe**: Multiple registry value writes. While svchost hosts system services, **unusual registry modifications** (without context) could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., tampering with system settings).\n   - **RuntimeBroker.exe**: Associated with UWP apps, so these writes might be **legitimate** (e.g., app-specific configurations). However, **unauthorized changes** would be concerning.\n\n4. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Command Line**: `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` is benign. The `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is the default, so **no immediate risk**.\n   - **Image Loads**: Loading .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is **normal** for PowerShell execution. However, the presence of `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` (a native image of PowerShell) is **expected** in this context.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**: The **repeated file creation** in `AppReadiness` and **registry modifications** by svchost.exe are **ambiguous**. They could be part of **legitimate system operations** (e.g., updates, app installations) but may also indicate **attempts to escalate privileges** or **persist malware**.\n- **No Clear Malware Indicators**: No obvious malicious payloads, suspicious command-line arguments, or network activity are present in the logs.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for **additional events** (e.g., network connections, process terminations) that might contextualize these activities.\n2. **Investigate the Repeated File Creation**: Verify if the `AppReadiness` files are part of a **known legitimate process** or if they are **unusual for the system's environment**.\n3. **Monitor svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe**: Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals utilities** to trace their behavior and confirm if they are interacting with **unexpected system resources**.\n4. **Check for System Updates\/Installations**: Determine if recent updates or software installations (e.g., Edge updates) could explain the activity.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **require further investigation** due to the **unusual file creation patterns** and **registry modifications**, but **no definitive signs of malware** are present. This is **interesting enough to warrant a deeper analysis** to rule out potential threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, Pipe Created, and Process accessed. Some of the files mentioned are from legitimate paths, like Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and .NET Framework components. But I notice that MpOAV.dll is loaded multiple times. Wait, is that normal? Well, Windows Defender's files are usually legitimate, but maybe if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a File created event in the Windows Temp directory with a filename that looks like a PowerShell script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_...). That might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but sometimes attackers use temp directories to store malicious scripts. However, the name here seems to be related to script policy testing, which could be benign if it's part of a legitimate process.\n\nAnother event has a PowerShell command line that's checking INF files for certain patterns. The command is using Get-Content and looking for defaultinstall sections. That might be part of a script that's checking for driver installations or something similar. But why would that be suspicious? Maybe if it's part of a larger malicious activity, but on its own, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are multiple Image loaded events for .NET assemblies like clr.dll and mscoreei.dll. Those are standard parts of the .NET runtime, so that's normal. The same with mscoree.dll. So those are probably legitimate.\n\nThe only non-PowerShell process is whoami.exe, which is a standard utility to get user information. The command line shows it's being run normally, so that's not suspicious.\n\nNow, looking for any anomalies. The repetition of loading MpOAV.dll might be normal if the process is interacting with Windows Defender. However, if there are other suspicious activities alongside it, that could be a concern. But in this batch, the other activities don't seem to point to obvious malicious behavior. The script file creation in Temp might be part of normal PowerShell operations, like testing execution policies or running scripts.\n\nBut wait, the command line in one of the PowerShell events is using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted. That's a security feature to prevent scripts from running unless they're signed or come from a trusted source. If a script is being run under Restricted policy, it might be a sign that the user is trying to bypass restrictions, but again, that's not necessarily malicious. It could be part of a legitimate script execution.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are related to normal PowerShell operations and legitimate system files. There's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or suspicious file modifications. The files created are in temp directories, which is common for scripts. The repeated loading of Defender DLLs might be part of the process's normal operation. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events with various tasks might be a bit unusual, but without more context or additional suspicious indicators (like unexpected commands, unusual parameters, or network activity), it's hard to classify this as definitely malicious.\n\nBut the system is asking if it's interesting for investigation. Since there's no overtly malicious activity, but there are a number of PowerShell events that could be part of a larger attack, maybe it's worth looking into further. However, based on the given data, it's not conclusive. The answer might be that it's not interesting because all activities appear legitimate. But I need to check again.\n\nWait, the same MpOAV.dll is loaded multiple times. Is that normal? Maybe if the process is running multiple times or if the DLL is being loaded by different processes. But in the logs, it's the same process (PowerShell) loading the same DLL. That might be normal if the process is interacting with Defender. Alternatively, it could be part of a technique where malware injects into a legitimate process. But without more data, like process trees or other indicators, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all that, the logs don't show clear signs of an attack. The activities are consistent with normal system operations and PowerShell usage. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's additional context not provided here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not indicate clear signs of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Legitimate System Components**:  \n   - Multiple references to **Windows Defender** components (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`) and **.NET Framework** assemblies (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) are normal and expected in a Windows environment. These are standard system files used for security and runtime operations.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**:  \n   - **File creation** in the `Windows\\Temp` directory (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.psm1`) is consistent with PowerShell's use of temporary files during script execution or policy testing. The filenames suggest benign operations (e.g., script policy validation).  \n   - The **command-line activity** checking INF files for patterns (e.g., `defaultinstall`) is not inherently suspicious. It could relate to system diagnostics or driver-related tasks.\n\n3. **No Red Flags**:  \n   - No evidence of **unusual network activity**, **unauthorized access**, or **malformed commands** is present.  \n   - The repetition of `MpOAV.dll` loading and `PowerShell` events appears to align with normal system behavior, not indicative of malware injection or evasion techniques.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   While the logs show typical PowerShell and system activity, there are no overt signs of compromise or malicious intent. **This batch is not interesting for investigation** unless additional context (e.g., unexpected process behavior, lateral movement, or external connections) is available. \n\n**Final Assessment**: No actionable threat detected."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event is about PowerShell loading a file from the Windows Defender directory. That's a bit suspicious because Windows Defender is a legitimate system component, but maybe the file path is unusual? Wait, the file is MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Platform. Hmm, maybe that's normal, but I should check other events.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe command using Dism to disable Windows Defender. Disabling Defender can be a red flag because attackers often remove security software. The command line shows they're disabling the feature and not restarting, which could be part of a setup to avoid detection.\n\nThen, multiple entries about Dism.exe creating and detecting executables in the Temp folder. The files are named things like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, etc. These are all part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment Infrastructure, but the fact that Dism is creating so many executable files in the Temp directory might be unusual. Normally, Dism is used for deployment, but creating multiple executables could indicate something's wrong, like a malicious payload being staged.\n\nWait, the first event had PowerShell accessing a legitimate Defender DLL, but the subsequent events involve Dism creating a bunch of files in Temp. Maybe the user is trying to disable Defender and then deploy some components. However, the presence of so many executable files in Temp might be a sign of a malicious process, especially if they're not part of a standard deployment. Also, the command to disable Defender is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection. \n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes disabling Defender, which is suspicious, and then creating multiple executables in the Temp directory. Even though some files are legitimate, the combination of these actions could indicate an attempt to compromise the system. The confidence is moderate because while some actions are normal, the combination and volume of events might be indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show disabling of Windows Defender via Dism, followed by creation of multiple executable files in the Temp directory, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. Each event has a file path in the Temp directory under AppData, specifically pointing to various .mui files.\n\nHmm, .mui files are usually Microsoft UI resource files, often part of language packs or system components. The fact that they're in the Temp folder might be normal if they're being used temporarily during some system operation. However, multiple detections of executable files in the Temp directory could be a red flag. But wait, the rule here is FileExecutableDetected, which might be a custom rule. I need to check if these files are actually legitimate.\n\nLooking at the file names: DismCore.dll.mui, DismProv.dll.mui, etc. These names seem related to DISM components. If these files are part of a legitimate DISM operation, then it's normal. But if they're being executed from the Temp directory, that might be unusual. However, DISM might temporarily place files there during its operations. \n\nWait, but the process is Dism.exe, which is legitimate. The detection here might be a false positive if the rule is too broad. Alternatively, if these files are not standard, that could be a problem.

However, the high number of events (15) might indicate something. But maybe DISM is just doing a lot of file operations. \n\nI think the key here is that the files are .mui, which are not typically executable. The rule \"FileExecutableDetected\" might be misconfigured, flagging .mui files as executable. If that's the case, then these alerts are false positives. But if the rule is correct and these files are actually being executed, that's a problem. \n\nBut given that the process is Dism.exe and the files are named after legitimate components, I'm leaning towards these being legitimate.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process detecting files as executable. The files are in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. The names of the files end with .dll.mui or .dll.\n\nFirst, I remember that Dism.exe is part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment tool, used for modifying Windows images. It's a legitimate tool, but sometimes malware can abuse it. However, the fact that multiple files are being detected here might be part of a normal system process, like during an image deployment or sysprep.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp folder. That's a common place for temporary files, but also a place where malware might drop files. However, the files here are .dll.mui and .dll, which are typically Windows system files. The GUID in the path suggests that this might be part of a specific operation, maybe a system update or a deployment task.\n\nThe rule triggering is \"FileExecutableDetected,\" which is a standard rule for detecting executable files. But since Dism.exe is a legitimate process, it's possible that these files are being executed as part of a legitimate operation. However, the number of files being detected here is quite high—16 entries. That's a lot for a normal process. Usually, Dism might handle a few files, but 16 different providers might be part of a larger operation.\n\nWait, looking at the file names: SmiProvider, SysprepProvider, TransmogProvider, UnattendProvider, VhdProvider, WimProvider, etc. These are all specific to different aspects of Windows deployment. For example, Sysprep is used to prepare a Windows image for deployment. So, if this system is in the middle of a sysprep process, then these files would be part of that. The GUID in the path could be a unique identifier for that particular sysprep operation.\n\nSo, the high number of files might not be suspicious if this is part of a legitimate deployment. However, if the system is not undergoing such a process, this could be unusual. But since the logs don't provide context about the system's current state, I can't be sure. However, the fact that all these files are being detected by Dism.exe, which is a legitimate tool, and the file names are related to deployment, it's possible that this is a normal activity.\n\nBut wait, the detection rule is \"FileExecutableDetected,\" which might be part of a security solution's alerting. If the system is running a legitimate deployment, then these alerts would be false positives. However, if the system is not in the middle of such a process, then this could be suspicious. However, without more context, like the system's current activity or other logs, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, but the presence of multiple .dll files might be part of a legitimate process. However, if these files were generated by the user or an application, that's normal. But if they're being generated by a process that's not expected, that's a red flag.\n\nBut given that the process is Dism.exe, which is known to handle these types of files during deployment, this might be acceptable. Therefore, unless there's other evidence of malicious activity, this might not be a security threat. However, the high number of files being detected might be worth investigating further, but based on the information given, it's likely a legitimate process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate that the **Dism.exe** process (a legitimate Windows tool for imaging and deployment) is detecting multiple files as executable within a temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`). The files include `.dll.mui` and `.dll` components with names like `SysprepProvider.dll`, `ImagingProvider.dll`, and others, which are associated with **Windows deployment and sysprep operations**.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Legitimacy of Dism.exe**:\n   - **Dism.exe** is a core Windows utility used for modifying Windows images (e.g., during deployment, sysprep, or imaging). Its involvement here is expected in scenarios involving system configuration or deployment.\n\n2. **File Context**:\n   - The files listed (e.g., `SysprepProvider.dll`, `VhdProvider.dll`) are **standard components** of Windows deployment tools. Their presence in a temporary directory (`Temp`) is typical during sysprep or imaging processes, which often generate temporary files with GUID-based paths.\n\n3. **High Volume of Files**:\n   - While 16 files may seem unusual, this volume aligns with **complex deployment scenarios** (e.g., sysprep, image customization, or multi-language support via `.mui` files). Such processes often involve multiple providers.\n\n4. **Security Considerations**:\n   - The **\"FileExecutableDetected\"** rule is a standard alert for executable files. However, in this context, the files are **legitimate system components** being handled by a trusted process (Dism.exe), not suspicious payloads.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs are **likely legitimate** and part of a **Windows deployment or sysprep operation**. The high number of files and their names are consistent with known behavior of Dism.exe during system imaging tasks. No immediate security threat is indicated based on the provided data. Further investigation would require contextual information (e.g., whether the system is undergoing deployment, recent changes to the environment, or other suspicious activity).\n\n**Final Determination**: **Not Interesting** (legitimate system activity)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system log event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events involve processes named Dism.exe or DismHost.exe. Dism is a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging and deployment, so that's a starting point. But the logs mention several files being detected as executable, like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc. These files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder. The fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded here might be normal during a deployment, but I need to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple \"File Executable Detected\" alerts from Dism.exe, each pointing to different DLLs in the same temporary directory. Then there are \"Image loaded\" events for DismHost.exe, which is also a legitimate process. However, the combination of multiple executable files being detected and loaded from the same temporary location could be a red flag. Typically, during a legitimate deployment, you might see some DLLs being loaded, but the sheer number and the fact that they're all in the Temp folder might indicate something unusual.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the command line for DismHost.exe. It includes a GUID and a path that seems to be part of the same temporary directory. That might be part of a normal process, but if this is happening in an environment where such deployments aren't expected, it could be malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the fact that all these files are being loaded from the Temp folder, which is a common place for malware to stage files, raises some concerns.\n\nI should also check if there are any known legitimate uses of these DLLs. For example, DismProv.dll and CbsProvider.dll are part of the Windows Deployment Services, so they might be legitimate. However, the presence of multiple provider DLLs being loaded in quick succession might be more than usual. The key here is whether this is part of a normal deployment process or an unexpected activity.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided additional context about the system's normal operations, I have to go purely on the logs. The events themselves don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unexpected network connections or unusual process behavior. But the concentration of multiple executable files in the Temp directory, combined with the ImageLoad events, might warrant further investigation. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate system update or deployment, but it's also possible that an attacker is using Dism-related processes to execute malicious code.\n\nIn conclusion, while the processes involved are legitimate, the pattern of multiple executable files being loaded from the Temp directory could be suspicious. This might not be a false positive, but it's not definitively malicious either. Therefore, it's worth flagging for further analysis to determine if this is a legitimate activity or a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events observed involve legitimate Windows processes (`Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe`) associated with deployment and imaging operations. However, **the pattern of activity raises potential concerns** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Processes**:\n   - `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe` are part of the Windows Deployment Imaging and Management (DISM) tool, used for system imaging, deployment, and configuration. Their presence alone is normal during OS deployment or updates.\n\n2. **File Activity in the Temp Directory**:\n   - Multiple `.dll` files (e.g., `ProvProvider.dll`, `DismCorePS.dll`, `MsiProvider.dll`) are being loaded from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\<GUID>`). While temporary directories are common for staging files during deployments, **this specific folder structure and the volume of `.dll` files loaded may be unusual** for standard system operations.\n\n3. **\"Image Loaded\" Events**:\n   - The `ImageLoad` events for `DismHost.exe` and its associated DLLs are typical during process execution. However, **loading multiple provider DLLs (e.g., `OSProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`, `LogProvider.dll`) from the same temporary directory** could indicate either:\n     - A **legitimate deployment or repair operation** (e.g., Windows Update, sysprep).\n     - **Unusual behavior** if this occurs outside the context of a known deployment or in a non-expected environment (e.g., a user machine without deployment tools).\n\n4. **Lack of Context**:\n   - Without additional information (e.g., whether this system is part of a deployment environment, recent OS updates, or sysprep activity), it is challenging to definitively classify this as benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Suspicious File Location**: While the Temp directory is not inherently malicious, **malware often uses it to stage files**. The fact that multiple `.dll` files are being loaded from the same folder may be a red flag if this is not part of a known deployment process.\n- **Lack of User Interaction**: If this activity occurs without user context (e.g., during boot, in a non-interactive session), it could indicate automated or potentially unauthorized activity.\n- **No Clear Malicious Indicators**: There are no direct signs of malware (e.g., network connections, unusual process behavior, or file modifications outside the Temp directory).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with System Context**:\n   - Check if the system is part of a deployment environment (e.g., a Windows image server, a machine undergoing sysprep, or a virtual machine being provisioned).\n   - Review recent system changes (e.g., OS updates, software installations, or deployment scripts).\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Track whether similar activity occurs repeatedly or in unexpected contexts (e.g., on endpoints not involved in deployment).\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **SIEM systems** to analyze the behavior of `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe`.\n\n3. **Inspect the Temp Directory**:\n   - Manually inspect the contents of the Temp folder mentioned in the logs to confirm whether the files are legitimate DISM components or unknown binaries.\n\n4. **Check for Known Exploits**:\n   - Investigate if there are any known vulnerabilities or exploits related to DISM tools that could be leveraged by attackers (e.g., elevation of privilege via misconfigured deployment scripts).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the processes involved are legitimate, **the pattern of file activity in the Temp directory and the volume of `.dll` files loaded warrant further investigation**. This could be part of a normal deployment process, but it could also indicate a potential security incident if the context is unclear. **Further correlation with system logs and user activity is essential** to determine the true nature of the activity. \n\n**Verdict**: **Monitor closely; further analysis is required to confirm benignity.**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about the 'DismHost.exe' process loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The files have names like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. All these DLLs are in the same Temp folder with a specific UUID. Then there's an event where 'DismHost.exe' terminates, and later 'Dism.exe' deletes some of the DLLs that were previously loaded.\n\nNow, thinking about what's normal here. DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM), which is used for Windows image management. It's common for DISM to load various providers (like the ones mentioned) when performing tasks like applying updates or configuring images. The temporary directory is a typical place for such operations, and the UUID suggests a unique session, which might be part of a legitimate process.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple DLLs are loaded from the same temporary directory could be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses temporary directories to execute malicious code. But in this case, the process is DismHost.exe, which is a legitimate process. The deletion of the DLLs by Dism.exe after the process terminates might be part of cleanup, which is normal for temporary files.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many different provider DLLs being loaded? That's a lot. Maybe during a DISM operation, multiple providers are required. However, the presence of so many could also be suspicious if they're not standard. However, looking at the names like AppxProvider.dll, SysprepProvider.dll, etc., these are known providers used by DISM for different purposes. So it's possible that this is a legitimate operation, such as preparing an image or applying updates.\n\nAnother point is that the process terminates, and then the files are deleted. That's consistent with temporary files being used and then cleaned up. If the files weren't deleted, that might be a concern, but here they are. Also, the fact that the same UUID is used in the Temp folder suggests a single session, which is typical for a one-time operation.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's any anomaly. For example, if the DLLs were not signed or came from an unexpected location. However, the user hasn't provided information about the integrity of the files. Assuming that the system is secure and the files are legitimate, this is normal. However, if the user is in a scenario where they're investigating potential malware, the high number of DLLs and their temporary nature could be a point to check further.\n\nIn summary, while the events could be part of a legitimate DISM operation, the high volume of DLLs loaded and the temporary nature might warrant further investigation to ensure that there's no malicious activity masquerading as a legitimate process. But based on the information given, it's leaning towards being normal, but not entirely without suspicion. However, since the process is known and the actions align with typical DISM behavior, it's probably not malicious. Still, in a security context, it's worth verifying the legitimacy of the files and the process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described are consistent with a **legitimate DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) operation**, but they warrant **moderate scrutiny** due to specific patterns that could indicate either normal system behavior or potential anomalies. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process and Context:**\n   - **`DismHost.exe`** is a core component of DISM, used for managing Windows images (e.g., applying updates, configuring images). It commonly loads provider DLLs (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`) during operations.\n   - The **temporary directory path** (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`) is typical for DISM sessions, which use unique UUIDs to isolate operations.\n\n2. **Provider DLLs and Their Purpose:**\n   - The loaded DLLs (e.g., `TransmogProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`) are **known DISM providers** associated with tasks like image preparation, sysprep, and update application. Their presence aligns with standard DISM workflows.\n\n3. **Cleanup Behavior:**\n   - **`Dism.exe`** deletes the DLLs after the session concludes. This is consistent with DISM's temporary file management, where files are deleted post-operation to free space.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Warranting Further Investigation):**\n- **High Volume of DLLs:**  \n  While DISM can load many providers, the sheer number of DLLs (14+ in this case) might be unusual unless explicitly tied to a complex image customization task. This could indicate either a **legitimate but resource-intensive operation** or an **attempt to obfuscate malicious activity** (e.g., loading benign DLLs to mask malicious code).\n\n- **No File Integrity Checks:**  \n  The logs do not confirm whether the DLLs are signed or originate from trusted sources. If the system is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into a DISM session, leveraging the legitimate process to execute payloads.\n\n- **Absence of User Context:**  \n  The logs do not mention the user account or context (e.g., admin vs. standard user) under which the operation occurred. Elevated privileges during such operations could be exploited for malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Likely Legitimate:** The events align with standard DISM behavior during image management or deployment tasks.\n- **But Not Definitively Benign:** The lack of file integrity checks, high volume of DLLs, and absence of user context **warrant further investigation** to rule out exploitation of DISM for malicious purposes (e.g., **DLL hijacking**, **process injection**).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify File Integrity:**  \n   Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **SigCheck** to confirm the digital signatures of the loaded DLLs. Untrusted or unsigned files could indicate compromise.\n\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs:**  \n   Check for additional logs (e.g., **Event Viewer**, **SIEM alerts**) that might indicate unusual behavior, such as unexpected network activity, registry changes, or unauthorized access.\n\n3. **Monitor for Repeated Patterns:**  \n   If similar events occur frequently or involve non-standard providers, investigate further for potential abuse of DISM.\n\n4. **Check User Context:**  \n   Confirm whether the operation was initiated by a legitimate admin or user account. Unusual access patterns (e.g., non-admin users running DISM) should be flagged.\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \nThe events are **highly likely legitimate** but **require context and verification** to rule out exploitation. In a security-focused environment, this would be a **low-priority alert** unless corroborated by other suspicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are related to the Dism.exe process performing file deletions and one instance of changing a file's creation time.

The names of the files include DLLs and MUI files, which are typically part of Windows Imaging and Deployment tools.\n\nNow, Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing images. However, the fact that multiple files are being deleted from the Temp directory might be normal during operations like system updates or deployments. But there's a catch here. The user's Temp directory is a common place for temporary files, but if the system is deleting a large number of files associated with Dism, it could indicate that something is going on. \n\nWait, but looking at the events, they all seem to be deletions of files that are part of the Dism tool itself. The GUID in the path suggests that this might be part of a specific operation or a temporary deployment. However, the deletion of multiple files, especially DLLs and MUI files, could be a sign of a cleanup process. But why are these files being deleted? If Dism is running as part of a legitimate system update, this might be normal. However, if these deletions are happening outside of a known update or deployment window, it might be suspicious.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the events are all related to file deletions, which could be part of a malicious activity where an attacker is trying to remove evidence. However, without additional context, such as other processes running or network activity, it's hard to confirm.

However, since there's no indication of other malicious activity, like unexpected network connections or other processes, it's possible that this is just a normal system process.\n\nBut then again, the fact that all these files are being deleted by Dism.exe could be a sign that the system is being manipulated. For example, if an attacker is using Dism to remove files that are part of a security tool or system components. However, without more evidence, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, while the events are suspicious, they might be part of a legitimate system operation. However, the high number of deletions and the location in the Temp directory could be a red flag. It's important to check for other signs of compromise, but based solely on these events, it's not conclusive evidence of a security threat. Therefore, the classification might be \"Suspicious but not confirmed\" or \"Potential False Positive.\"\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **Dism.exe** process performing multiple file deletions and one file creation time modification within the user's **Temp directory** under a GUID-specific folder.

It is commonly involved in system updates, deployments, and imaging tasks.\n\n2. **File Deletion Pattern**:  \n   - The deletions target **DLLs and MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files** associated with Dism, such as `DismCore.dll`, `DmiProvider.dll`, and their language-specific counterparts (`.mui` files). These files are part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment tools.\n\n3. **Location**:  \n   - All files are in the **user's Temp directory** (`%TEMP%\\{GUID}\\...`), which is a typical location for temporary files generated during system operations.\n\n4. **No Immediate Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - There is no evidence of **unusual network activity**, **unexpected processes**, or **file modifications** that would strongly suggest a security threat. The deletions appear to be **part of a cleanup process**.\n\n### **Potential Explanations**:\n- **Legitimate System Operation**:  \n  The deletions could be part of a **system update**, **deployment**, or **image customization** task. Dism often generates and deletes temporary files during such operations.\n- **False Positive**:  \n  The activity might be **benign**, especially if the system is undergoing a known update or deployment. The GUID in the path could correspond to a specific task or session.\n\n### **Suspicious Aspects**:\n- **High Volume of Deletions**:  \n  While Dism may delete temporary files, the **large number of deletions** (15+ entries) could be unusual unless explicitly tied to a known process.\n- **Absence of Context**:  \n  Without additional data (e.g., logs from the deployment task, user activity, or network events), it is challenging to confirm the legitimacy of the activity.\n\n### **Recommendation**:\n- **Monitor for Correlated Events**:  \n  Check for **other suspicious activities** (e.g., unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or changes to system files outside the Temp directory).\n- **Review System Logs**:  \n  Examine **Windows Event Logs** for entries related to the Dism process or the GUID folder to determine if the deletions are part of a known, legitimate task.\n- **Check for Updates\/Deployments**:  \n  Verify if the system is undergoing a **scheduled update or deployment**, which could explain the activity.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events **do not strongly indicate a security threat** but are **suspicious due to the high volume of deletions** and lack of explicit context. **Further investigation** is warranted, but the activity could be **legitimate** if tied to a known system process.  \n\n**Classification**: **Suspicious but Not Confirmed** (Potential False Positive or Legitimate System Activity)."}

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all related to the Dism.exe process deleting files in the Temp directory.

But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the user is looking for a different angle. However, with the given data, the answer is that this is likely normal behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **`Dism.exe`** process (a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging and deployment) is deleting multiple **`.dll` files** located in the **`%TEMP%` directory**. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Process**:  \n   `Dism.exe` is a trusted Windows utility, commonly used during system deployment, imaging, or updates. It is normal for it to delete temporary files during these operations.\n\n2. **Location of Files**:  \n   All files are in the **`%TEMP%` directory**, which is a standard location for temporary files generated during system operations. Deletion of such files is typical after their use.\n\n3. **File Names**:  \n   The `.dll` files (e.g., `FfuProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`) are named in a pattern consistent with **Windows Setup\/Deployment Providers**. These are often used during system imaging or configuration and may be part of a legitimate process.\n\n4. **No Anomalies Detected**:  \n   - No unusual process behavior (e.g., unexpected parent processes, command-line arguments, or non-standard execution paths).  \n   - No signs of malware or unauthorized activity (e.g., file encryption, unexpected network activity, or user account anomalies).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis activity is **likely benign** and part of a **normal system operation** (e.g., a deployment, imaging, or cleanup process). The deletion of temporary files by `Dism.exe` in the `%TEMP%` directory is consistent with its intended functionality.\n\n**Classification**: `Not Suspicious`  \n**Confidence Level**: High (95%)  \n**Reason**: All observed behavior aligns with the expected operation of `Dism.exe` during system deployment or cleanup tasks. No indicators of compromise are present in the logs."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this log data to figure out what's going on. There are several entries here, some with processes and others with \"None\" for the process. The user probably wants to know if there's any malicious activity or something noteworthy.\n\nFirst, looking at the entries with processes. There's \"services.exe\", \"sppsvc.exe\", \"svchost.exe\" – these are all legitimate Windows processes. They're usually part of system services, so that's normal. The \"Registry value set\" and \"Image loaded\" events might be part of normal system operations, but I should check if there's anything unusual.\n\nThen there's the entry with \"powershell.exe\" running a command to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" and start it. The binary path is \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Hmm, the path has some non-English terms like \"unidade_logico\" which means \"logical unit\" in Portuguese. That's a bit suspicious because many malicious scripts use non-English paths to avoid detection. Also, creating a new service via PowerShell isn't inherently bad, but the fact that it's being done with a custom executable in a non-standard directory might be a red flag.\n\nThe \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks under winlog might be related to the PowerShell process. These could be part of an event provider or something else, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the repeated entries of the same PowerShell command suggest that this is a significant action. \n\nI should also check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a known legitimate file. If not, that's a problem. The path doesn't look like a standard Windows directory, which is another red flag. Typically, services are installed in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" or other system directories. The presence of \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_comum\" (common registry) might be part of a custom application, but again, the non-English terms could be a tactic to obfuscate.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the PowerShell command uses the New-Service cmdlet to create a service and then starts it. This is a way to persistently run a process, which is a common technique in malware. The fact that it's being done with a custom executable might indicate an attempt to install a backdoor or some other malicious component.\n\nThe other entries with \"None\" for the process might be system events that don't involve a specific process, but they don't seem to be related to the suspicious activity. However, the repeated PowerShell entries are the main concern here.\n\nIn summary, the key point is the PowerShell command creating a new service with a non-standard executable path. This should be investigated further to confirm if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is malicious or part of a legitimate application. If it's not known, it's advisable to quarantine the file and analyze it with antivirus tools or a sandbox.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log data indicates a potential security incident involving the creation of a new Windows service via PowerShell, which could be malicious. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Command:**  \n     ```powershell\n     New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\n     Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n     ```\n   - **Purpose:**  \n     This command creates and starts a new Windows service named `objeto_ativo` (Portuguese for \"active object\") with the executable located at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n2. **Non-Standard Path and Naming:**\n   - The path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` includes non-English terms (e.g., `unidade_logico` = \"logical unit\", `registro_comum` = \"common registry\") and a custom directory structure. This is unusual for legitimate Windows services, which typically reside in system directories like `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\n3. **Potential Persistence Mechanism:**\n   - Creating a new service allows for **persistent execution** of the malicious payload (`tarefa_logico.exe`), which is a common tactic in malware to maintain access to the system.\n\n4. **Repetition of the Same Command:**\n   - The PowerShell command appears **multiple times** in the logs, suggesting either repeated attempts or a script that is actively trying to establish persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n- **Malicious Executable Path:**  \n  `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`  \n  *(Check if this file exists and analyze its behavior.)*\n\n- **Service Name:**  \n  `objeto_ativo`  \n  *(Unusual and potentially malicious.)*\n\n- **Command-Line Argument:**  \n  `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"...\"`  \n  *(Used to create a new service with a non-standard executable.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - **Isolate the System:** If this activity is detected on a production system, isolate it immediately to prevent further spread.\n   - **Check for the File:**  \n     Verify if `tarefa_logico.exe` exists in the specified path. If found, analyze it using tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Kaspersky**, or **sandboxing** to determine if it is malicious.\n   - **Remove the Service:**  \n     If the service is confirmed malicious, delete it using the command:  \n     ```powershell\n     Remove-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Long-Term Mitigation:**\n   - **Monitor PowerShell Usage:**  \n     Use tools like **Microsoft Defender ATP** or **SIEM systems** to monitor for suspicious PowerShell commands (e.g., `New-Service`, `Start-Service`).\n   - **Restrict Privileges:**  \n     Limit the use of PowerShell to administrative accounts and enable **script block logging** for auditing.\n   - **Update Antivirus Definitions:**  \n     Ensure that antivirus software is updated to detect potential threats in the file `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n3. **Investigation:**\n   - **Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe`:**  \n     If the file is confirmed malicious, submit it to threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) for further analysis.\n   - **Check for Lateral Movement:**  \n     Investigate if other systems on the network have been compromised or if the malicious service is part of a larger attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe creation of the service `objeto_ativo` using a non-standard executable path is a **high-risk event** that requires immediate investigation. The use of non-English terms in the file path and the persistence mechanism suggest a potential **malware installation**. Take the steps outlined above to mitigate the risk and determine the full scope of the incident."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event stands out because it's using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable in a non-standard directory: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. Then it starts that service. That seems suspicious because creating a service with a custom executable, especially from a directory that's not typical for system services, could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe rest of the events are PowerShell commands with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which is the default policy. The commands are mostly writing output like 'Final result: 1' or checking INF files for certain patterns. Those might be part of a legitimate script or a benign process, but the repetition of the same command multiple times could indicate something automated. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're harmful.\n\nThe key point here is the first event. Creating a new service with a non-system path is a red flag. Even though the other events don't show obvious malicious intent, the presence of that one event makes the batch interesting for investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because there's not enough info on the other commands, but the first event alone is enough to warrant further look into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows PowerShell creating and starting a new service ('objeto_ativo') with a binary path pointing to a non-standard directory (C:\\\\unidade_logico...), which is a common tactic in malware to execute arbitrary code. Other events contain repetitive benign-looking commands, but the service creation warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first two events are identical. Both involve a PowerShell command executed with the ExecutionPolicy Restricted. The command is searching through INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns related to defaultinstall sections for different architectures (amd64, arm, etc.). The purpose here might be to check if any of these INF files contain installation sections that could be part of a setup or driver installation. However, the presence of such sections isn't inherently malicious, but the fact that this is being checked might indicate some kind of automated scanning or detection process. \n\nThe next two events are different. One is related to \"Security Group Management\" and another to \"Special Logon\", but they don't have process information. These might be normal system events related to user logons or group management, which are common and not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThe fifth event is about \"services.exe\" under the \"Logon\" task. Since services.exe is a legitimate system process, this might be part of normal system operations during user logon. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if there's anything wrong here.\n\nNow, considering the first two events again. The PowerShell script is looking for INF files with specific sections. INF files are used in Windows for installing drivers and other system components. The script checks if any of these INF files have a defaultinstall section for different architectures. This could be part of a legitimate process, like checking for compatible drivers. However, if this is done in an unusual context or by an unauthorized user, it could be a sign of something malicious, like trying to find vulnerable drivers to exploit.\n\nBut in this batch, there are no other events that indicate a security breach, such as unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or other suspicious processes. The other events are either normal system tasks or lack enough information to be concerning. \n\nThe key here is that the PowerShell command might be part of a legitimate tool, but it's also possible that it's being used in a malicious way. However, the batch doesn't provide enough evidence of malicious activity beyond the script execution. Since the user is asking to consider the entire batch, and the only potentially interesting part is the PowerShell script, but without more context or other suspicious events, the confidence level is moderate. \n\nI think the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because the PowerShell script is scanning INF files, which could be part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context, it's not definitive. The confidence is around 0.6 because while the script is unusual, it's not enough on its own to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated PowerShell commands scanning INF files for architecture-specific installation sections, which may indicate system enumeration or preparation for malicious activity. However, no direct malicious actions (e.g., file modifications, network connections) are observed in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
