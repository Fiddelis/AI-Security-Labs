{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is being accessed. The winlog task is ProcessAccess. Not too suspicious yet, but then there's whoami.exe being created. That's a normal command to check the current user, so maybe legitimate. But then there's another powershell.exe access, and then a registry value set. Hmm, registry modifications can be a red flag if done by unexpected processes.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that's adding an entry to the Run key in the registry, pointing to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\". That's suspicious because modifying the Run key to execute a program at startup is a common tactic for malware. Then, reg.exe is used to add another entry to the Run key, this time for \"pacote_temporario.exe\". Using reg.exe directly is often seen in attacks, so that's another red flag.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry values being set. Also, a file named \"modulo_padrao.txt\" is created in the Downloads folder by powershell.exe. While creating files isn't inherently bad, the combination with the registry modifications and the use of reg.exe and cmd.exe to add startup entries is concerning.\n\nAnother file creation event involves winlogbeat.exe, which is a legitimate tool for log collection. But the fact that it's creating a .yml.new file might be part of normal operations, but when combined with the other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger scheme.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry modifications, use of reg.exe and cmd.exe to add startup entries, and file creations. These could indicate an attempt to persist on the system, which is a common malicious behavior. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination and frequency of these events suggest potential malicious activity. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe executions modifying registry startup entries (HKCU\\\\Run), use of reg.exe to add persistent execution paths, and file creation in user Downloads directory. These patterns are commonly associated with malware persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
