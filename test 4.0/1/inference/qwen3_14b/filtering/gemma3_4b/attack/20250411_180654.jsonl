{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets related to chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry multiple times might be normal, but repeated events could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe Chrome is just updating settings or extensions.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. The command line shows it's running from the system32 directory, which is standard. So that's probably okay.\n\nThe next interesting part is the powershell.exe process with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The script is being executed with a log path in the TEMP directory. Keystroke logging is a red flag because it's often used for stealing sensitive information. The fact that this script is being run multiple times, and the paths mentioned (like C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\estrutura_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1) seem suspicious. Also, the script is being called from different directories, which might indicate an attempt to evade detection by varying paths.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs. While PowerShell using .NET is normal, the specific DLLs loaded here (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc.) are part of the .NET runtime. However, if these are being loaded in an unusual context or from unexpected locations, that could be a sign of something malicious. But in this case, the paths are standard system directories, so maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nThe command lines for the PowerShell processes include running Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. Keystroke loggers are typically used by malware to capture sensitive data like passwords. The presence of multiple instances of this script being executed, even if from different paths, suggests that this might be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together: the main red flags are the execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 multiple times, which is a known malicious script. Even though some events are normal (like file creation, registry access), the combination of these PowerShell commands and the repeated execution of keystroke logging scripts is highly suspicious. The confidence level is high because keystroke logging is a clear indicator of potential malicious intent, especially when done repeatedly and in different directories, which might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directories, indicating potential keystroke logging malware. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where powershell.exe is running with command lines that include Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds familiarâ€”it's commonly associated with keylogging malware. The paths where these scripts are executed are all over the place, like C:\\objeto_secundario, C:\\registro_ativo, etc. These paths don't look standard, which might indicate they're trying to hide or obfuscate their location.\n\nThe log paths specified in the command lines are pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files, so that's a red flag. Also, there are multiple entries of the same script being run from different directories, which could be an attempt to evade detection by changing locations each time.\n\nThen there are events related to file creation and deletion, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 file being created and then deleted. That might be part of a script that's trying to execute without leaving traces. The Pipe Created event could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe winlog entries mention tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be part of the PowerShell engine or other processes, but again, when paired with the script names and paths, it's suspicious. There's also a Remote Command execution task, which could indicate someone is trying to run commands remotely, which is a big red flag.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign activities here. For example, the file creation by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe seems normal. But the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and the temporary log files are concerning. Also, the fact that the same script is being called from multiple different paths suggests an attempt to obfuscate the source.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of multiple keylogging scripts, temporary files in temp directories, and remote command execution are strong indicators of malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination here points towards a potential security threat. The confidence is high because the patterns match known malicious behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' from non-standard paths, writing logs to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, a common pattern for keylogging malware.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The file path mentioned is part of the Delivery Optimization service, which is used for file sharing between devices. The file name is keyValueLKG.dat, which might be a temporary or state file. This seems normal, but I should note that sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs. The file path here is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user-installed software. However, the presence of a .new file might indicate that the configuration is being updated. This could be normal, but if there's any unexpected behavior here, it might be worth looking into.\n\nThe third event is about powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads directory. PowerShell is a common tool used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The file name is entrada_padrao.txt, which translates to \"default input.txt\" in Portuguese. The presence of a text file created by PowerShell isn't inherently suspicious, but if there's a pattern of creating files in unusual locations or with unusual names, that could be a red flag.\n\nNow, looking at all three events together. The first two involve legitimate processes (svchost and winlogbeat) creating files in expected locations. The third event with PowerShell is more ambiguous. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual network activity, or known malicious file names. The files created are either part of normal operations or user-initiated actions. \n\nI should check if any of the files are in unexpected directories or if there are multiple events from the same process that might indicate a larger pattern. In this case, the events are isolated and don't show a clear attack chain. The confidence level is moderate because while there's no obvious malicious activity, the presence of PowerShell creating a file could be a starting point for further investigation. However, since the justification isn't strong enough, maybe it's not interesting. Wait, but the user wants to know if the batch is relevant. Since there's no clear malicious activity, perhaps it's not interesting. But I'm a bit conflicted here. The PowerShell event might be benign, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes creating files in expected locations (system services, user Downloads directory). No suspicious file paths, unexpected process behavior, or security-relevant anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
