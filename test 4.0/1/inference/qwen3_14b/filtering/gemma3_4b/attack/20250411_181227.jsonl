The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands being executed. Each command seems to be creating a scheduled task using the New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask cmdlets. The command lines are similar, with variations in the task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. All of them set the trigger to \"AtLogon\", the user to \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" with RunLevel Highest, and the action is to execute calc.exe. \n\nWait, calc.exe is just a calculator, but why would someone create a scheduled task for that? Typically, that's not a normal user behavior. Scheduled tasks with high privileges and set to run at logon might be suspicious, especially if they're created via PowerShell. Also, the fact that there are multiple such tasks registered with different names but the same structure could indicate an attempt to automate something, maybe even a persistence mechanism.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to registry value sets and process accesses. However, the majority of the events are about PowerShell creating scheduled tasks. The presence of multiple similar events in a short time frame could be a red flag. \n\nThe other events involve chrome.exe and image loaded events, but they don't seem as concerning. The key here is the repeated use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with administrative privileges. This could be part of a larger attack, like establishing persistence on the system. \n\nI should check if there's any indication of malicious activity beyond just the scheduled tasks. But in this batch, the main suspicious activity is the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges. Since these tasks are set to run at logon and use the Administrators group, this might be an attempt to maintain access or execute commands under high privileges. \n\nThe confidence here would be high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with such parameters is a known technique used by attackers. Even though calc.exe is benign, the method and context make this suspicious. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) under the Administrators group, triggering execution of calc.exe at logon.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they're all about PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are all legitimate .NET Framework files, so that's probably normal. But then there's an entry where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory, then deletes it. That might be suspicious because creating and deleting a temporary file could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command that uses ScheduledTask to run calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group and highest privileges. That's definitely a red flag. Using Scheduled Tasks to execute a calculator is a common technique in attacks to maintain persistence. The command line shows the use of New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are PowerShell cmdlets that can be abused for malicious purposes.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. However, since Chrome is a common application, and registry changes can be part of normal operations or extensions, but repeated entries might indicate something, though not as suspicious as the PowerShell events.\n\nFurther down, there are several entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task. The process is listed as None, which might mean the event is from a source where the process isn't logged, or it's a system-level event. However, multiple remote command executions could indicate a potential compromise, especially if they're not part of a legitimate service or user action.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation with high privileges, are significant. Creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe (which is a simple application, but here used as a payload) suggests an attempt to establish persistence. The temporary file creation and deletion might be part of executing a script that was downloaded. The remote command executions add another layer of concern, possibly indicating remote access or a command and control channel.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be false positives or part of legitimate activities. For example, the .NET DLLs are normal, and Chrome's registry changes could be from updates or extensions. But the combination of PowerShell's suspicious actions and the remote command events increases the likelihood of a security incident.\n\nConfidence-wise, the presence of multiple suspicious activities (scheduled task with admin rights, remote commands) makes me lean towards \"INTERESTING\", but I should note that some events might be benign. The confidence is around 0.75 because while there are clear red flags, not all events are definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including creation of a scheduled task with administrative privileges to execute calc.exe, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of potentially legitimate but contextually suspicious DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each line and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries have \"winlog\" with the task \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's a lot of them. But then there's a line where the process is powershell.exe with a command line that's creating a scheduled task. The command line shows using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a bit suspicious because calc.exe is a legitimate Windows app, but creating a scheduled task with that might be part of something malicious. Also, the principal is set to Administrators group with high privileges, which could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's an entry where WmiPrvSE.exe loaded taskschd.dll. WmiPrvSE is the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service, and taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler. Loading that DLL might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nNext, there are several svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but multiple registry changes might indicate something trying to modify system settings. Then, a file is created in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum\", which might be a scheduled task being created. That's another point to note.\n\nThere's also a powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory, which is sometimes used for storing temporary files, but could also be part of persistence mechanisms. Another entry shows chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well. However, if chrome is loading these, it might be a sign of something trying to bypass detection, though that's a bit of a stretch. Maybe it's just normal behavior, but combined with other events, it's worth looking into.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of legitimate monitoring, but the presence of that file could be normal depending on the setup.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks, a scheduled task being created with elevated privileges, registry changes by svchost, and file creations in system directories. The combination of these events might indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute commands remotely. However, some of these could be benign, like scheduled tasks or normal system processes. But the repeated execution commands and the creation of a scheduled task with admin rights are concerning. The confidence here might be around 0.75 because there are enough suspicious events to warrant further investigation, but not conclusive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events, creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges (Administrators group), and suspicious file operations (e.g., 'unidade_comum' task creation) suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking at the batch of events. Most of them are about chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of entries. But wait, chrome.exe usually doesn't modify the registry that much. Maybe that's normal, but repeated registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're part of some configuration or malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a couple of other events. One is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal during setup. But the other event is powershell.exe creating a file named \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". The name is in Spanish, which might be benign, but sometimes malicious scripts use such names to blend in. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily bad. \n\nNow, considering the combination. The majority of events are chrome.exe modifying the registry. If this is a normal user's machine, maybe chrome is updating its settings, but repeated registry changes could indicate something else. However, without more context like the specific registry keys being modified or other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell. The other events don't show clear signs of compromise. The file creations are in typical locations and by legitimate processes. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the batch is interesting, the key is whether there's a pattern that suggests malicious behavior. The repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe might be a red flag, but it's not conclusive. However, without more data, like the registry keys involved or other processes, it's a bit ambiguous. I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear malicious activity, but the repeated registry changes could be a sign. Hmm. Maybe the confidence is moderate. The justification would be that while there are multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, which is unusual, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The other events are normal file creations by legitimate processes. So overall, not interesting but with some caution.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe (common for legitimate browser operations) and normal file creation activities by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe.
