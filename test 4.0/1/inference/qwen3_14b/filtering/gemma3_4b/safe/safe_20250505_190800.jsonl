The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation. Then there are a bunch of registry value sets by mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE. Those could be legitimate, but sometimes malicious software uses the registry.\n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe activity. The command line shows it's being run from the usual location, which is normal. But then there are multiple ImageLoad events loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET and Windows Defender. That's typical for PowerShell running scripts, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, there's a file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's interesting. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers do this to avoid leaving traces. Also, the file name has a random-looking string, which might be obfuscation.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event, which could be for communication between processes. Not necessarily bad, but combined with the temp file creation and deletion, it might indicate something's up. The repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events might just be normal PowerShell operations, but the combination of all these events could point to a script being executed and then cleaned up.\n\nI need to check if there are any signs of malicious activity. The temp file creation and deletion is a red flag. Also, the multiple ImageLoads might be part of a legitimate script, but if the script is malicious, that's a problem. However, without more context like the content of the script or network activity, it's hard to say. But the fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly might be suspicious. The classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because of the potential for a temporary script being used and then removed, which is common in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes loaded .NET and Windows Defender DLLs, created and immediately deleted a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1) in the user's Temp directory, which is suspicious behavior often seen in attack chains.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple file creation events related to PowerShell scripts. Specifically, there's a file named teste.ps1 created in the Downloads directory. Then, there's a process creation event where PowerShell is executed with the -ExecutionPolicy Bypass flag, which is often used to run scripts without being blocked by default execution policies. That's a red flag.\n\nNext, there are several image load events involving .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. While loading these DLLs isn't inherently malicious, the context here matters. The PowerShell process is loading these libraries, which could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with the bypassed execution policy and the creation of temporary files, it raises suspicion.\n\nThere's also a file deletion event for a temporary script file, which might be an attempt to clean up after executing a script. Additionally, a registry value set event and a remote command execution task are logged. The remote command execution is particularly concerning as it could indicate a remote attack or command and control activity.\n\nThe presence of Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper, might be normal, but the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. The user is creating and executing scripts, modifying registry values, and loading various DLLs, which could be part of an attack chain. However, without more context like the content of the scripts or network activity, it's a bit tricky. But based on the events alone, the suspicious actions (bypassing execution policy, remote command execution, temporary file creation and deletion) make this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is around 0.75 because while some events are normal, the combination points to potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell script execution with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, creation\/deletion of temporary scripts, registry modifications, and potential remote command execution.
