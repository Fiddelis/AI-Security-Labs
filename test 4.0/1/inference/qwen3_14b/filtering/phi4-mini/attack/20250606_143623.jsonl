So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. The tasks include Process accessed, Process Create, Registry value set, and Image loaded. Then there's an entry where powershell.exe is creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a file in C:\\unidade_logico... That path looks a bit odd. Why is it in a directory named \"registro_comum\" and \"entrada_base\"? Maybe that's a red flag. The file name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows executable.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image loaded events for various DLLs, including some from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll might be part of Defender's operations. However, the key point here is the creation of the service. Creating a new service with a custom executable is a common tactic in malware to persist after an attack. The fact that the service is started immediately after creation adds to the suspicion.\n\nAlso, there's a File Delete event where a temporary PowerShell script is deleted. That could be an attempt to remove evidence. The Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to say. The repeated Registry value set events for services.exe might be normal, but combined with other activities, they could indicate tampering.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable, followed by starting it, along with the deletion of a temporary script, seems suspicious. The use of PowerShell for these actions is common in attacks. The confidence here is pretty high because these are indicators of compromise. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including service creation with a non-standard executable path (C:\\\\unidade_logico...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe), repeated process access, and registry modifications.

The first two entries are about the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. That seems normal because those are part of the .NET framework. But maybe if there's something unusual about how they're being loaded? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for temporary files, but sometimes malicious scripts use that area. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily bad. The next entry is PowerShell setting a registry value. Registry changes can be suspicious if they're modifying keys that control system behavior, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from services.exe, svchost.exe, and MsMpEng.exe (which is Microsoft's malware protection engine) making registry changes. A lot of registry events from system processes might be normal, especially during updates or service startups. However, the repetition of 'Registry value set' from svchost.exe multiple times could indicate something automated or perhaps a script running. But svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, so it's possible that these are just normal operations.\n\nThe last entry is a file created by WindowsUpdate with a .etl file, which is a trace log. That seems normal as WindowsUpdate would generate logs. MsMpEng.exe is also a legitimate process, so its registry changes might be part of its normal functioning.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two events are normal .NET loading. The PowerShell events could be benign, but maybe not. The numerous registry changes from svchost.exe and services.exe might be part of normal system operations, especially if they're related to updates or services starting up. However, the high number of registry events might be a red flag. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or unusual processes, it's hard to say. Since the majority of the events seem to be from legitimate processes and the only potentially suspicious part is the PowerShell activity, which isn't clearly malicious, I'd lean towards NOT INTERESTING.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the entries.\n\nMost of the events are about svchost.exe performing registry value sets or object additions\/deletions. There are several of these, but they might be normal since svchost.exe is a common system process that hosts various services. However, the repetition might be a red flag if it's unusual. But I need to check other events too.\n\nThen there are several entries from setup.exe creating files. The paths mentioned are in Program Files (x86) under Microsoft EdgeCore and Edge directories. The files created include msedge.exe, notification_helper.exe, pwahelper.exe, and others. Also, there's a setup.exe in the Installer directory. Now, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. But creating multiple executable files in a directory that's part of Microsoft Edge might be part of a legitimate installation. However, the presence of a batch file named show_third_party_software_licenses.bat could be suspicious. That name sounds like it might be trying to display licenses, but maybe it's a cover for something else.\n\nWait, but the setup.exe is creating these files in what seems like a legitimate Microsoft Edge directory. However, if this setup.exe isn't part of an official Microsoft installation, that could be a problem. Also, the fact that setup.exe is creating multiple executables and a batch file might indicate an installation process, but if it's not expected, that's a concern.\n\nAnother point is the combination of registry changes and file creation. The setup.exe is creating files and also modifying the registry. If these changes are part of a legitimate software installation, then it's normal. But if the setup.exe is not from a trusted source, that's a problem. However, the events don't mention the source or hash of the setup.exe, so I can't confirm if it's malicious.\n\nBut the presence of multiple file creations by setup.exe in a specific directory might be part of a legitimate Edge update or installation. However, the repetition of svchost.exe registry events could be normal or could indicate something else. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but the combination of setup.exe creating multiple files and registry changes might be worth investigating.\n\nSo, considering that, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a setup.exe creating multiple executable files in a specific directory, which could be part of an installation but might also be suspicious if it's unexpected. The registry changes by svchost.exe are common but repeated. However, the combination of both file creation and registry changes might indicate a possible malicious activity, especially if the setup.exe isn't from a known source. But since the events don't provide more details, the justification would be that the batch shows multiple file creations by setup.exe in a Microsoft Edge directory and numerous registry modifications by svchost.exe, which could be part of a legitimate process but might also indicate an installation or potential malicious activity. The confidence would be around 0.65 because there's enough to warrant further investigation but not conclusive evidence of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creations by 'setup.exe' in Microsoft Edge directories and repeated registry modifications by 'svchost.exe' may indicate an installation process or potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The answer has to be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The main process mentioned here is 'setup.exe' and 'svchost.exe'. The 'setup.exe' is doing a lot of registry value sets and creating files. For example, there's a file created at 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge_proxy.exe' and another at 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Microsoft Edge.lnk'. Also, there are multiple registry events related to 'setup.exe'.\n\nNow, I know that 'setup.exe' is a legitimate process, often part of software installation. However, the number of registry changes and file creations might be a red flag. Creating files in system directories like Program Files and ProgramData, especially with names related to Microsoft Edge, could be suspicious. Also, the 'svchost.exe' process is creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory. While that's normal for some operations, the high number of such events might indicate something unusual.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if these are normal activities. For example, during software installation, setup.exe might create files and modify the registry. However, the presence of multiple registry value sets and file creations, especially if they are not part of a known legitimate installation, could be signs of malicious activity. Also, the fact that 'setup.exe' is involved in creating a proxy executable might be a concern, as that could be part of a setup or a potential backdoor.\n\nHowever, without more context, like the source of the setup.exe or the specific changes made to the registry, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of multiple registry events and file creations by setup.exe, along with the temporary files created by svchost.exe, might be worth investigating. This could be a legitimate installation, but the volume and types of events might indicate something more. \n\nSo, the classification here is likely \"INTERESTING\" because there's a pattern of activity that could be indicative of a malicious process, even if it's not definitive. The confidence would be around 0.75 because while there are suspicious elements, they could also be part of a legitimate installation.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be a JSON with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. The first few entries are about svchost.exe creating files in temporary directories and AppReadiness. Some paths look normal, like the EdgeGameAssist.exe in WindowsApps, but others are in Temp or AppReadiness. The AppReadiness folder is used for application readiness, so maybe that's part of Windows updates or installations. However, multiple files being created there could be suspicious if they're not expected.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys or adding unexpected values, that's a red flag. However, without more context on what exactly is being changed, it's hard to say. But the fact that there are multiple such events might indicate some activity.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's just writing a host message. That seems benign, but the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which is the default. However, the ImageLoad events show loading of .NET assemblies like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll, which are normal for PowerShell. But then there's a FileCreate event for a script file in Temp, which could be part of a legitimate process or maybe a malicious one. The PipeCreated event might be part of normal communication, but again, depends on context.\n\nLooking at the classification: INTERESTING would be if there's a pattern that suggests potential compromise. The repeated file creation in AppReadiness and Temp, along with registry changes, might be indicative of something. However, svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so it's possible that these are legitimate. But the same process creating multiple files in unusual locations could be a sign of something else. The PowerShell script creating a file in Temp might be part of a legitimate test, but the presence of multiple events could be a sign of persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nThe justification needs to be concise. The key points are the multiple file creations in sensitive directories and registry changes by svchost.exe, plus the PowerShell activity. However, since some of these are normal, the confidence might be moderate. But if the system is a typical Windows environment, some of these might be normal. However, the repetition and the combination of file creation and registry changes might be suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nConfidence: Maybe around 0.6.

Not suspicious on its own. Then there's 'powershell.exe' being accessed and creating files. Creating a file in the Temp directory might be normal, but I should check for any unusual commands.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a PowerShell command that's checking for INF files with specific patterns. The command uses 'Get-Content' and checks for defaultinstall sections. This might be part of a script that's looking for something, maybe trying to find installation configurations. Not sure yet, but needs more context.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, which is normal since PowerShell loads various DLLs. However, the next event shows a file created in the Temp directory with a name like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1'. That seems like a temporary script file, which could be benign, but sometimes attackers use Temp directories to execute scripts.\n\nThe next event is a 'Pipe Created' which is usually normal, but not a red flag. Then, the command line for 'cmd.exe' uses 'Dism' to disable Windows Defender. That's a big red flag. Disabling Windows Defender is a common tactic by malware to avoid detection. The command is 'Dism \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet'. This would remove the Windows Defender feature without restarting, which is suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple 'File Executable Detected' events for Dism.exe loading various DLLs from the Temp directory. The files like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, etc., are being executed. That's unusual because those DLLs are typically part of Windows Update or system processes, but if they're being loaded from Temp, that's a sign of something malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The key points are using Dism to disable Windows Defender, creating executable files in Temp, and loading unexpected DLLs. These actions are indicative of an attacker trying to remove security software and execute malicious code. Even though some events are normal, the combination of disabling Defender and the Temp files being executed makes this batch interesting for investigation.\n\nConfidence is high because disabling a security feature like Defender is a clear indicator of malicious intent.

That's common for temporary files. The filenames include DLLs and MUI files, which are language-specific resources. Many of these files are .dll and .mui files, which are standard for Windows components. \n\nHowever, the fact that multiple executable files are being detected in the Temp folder might be suspicious.

It is common for `Dism` to interact with temporary files during operations like system updates or image creation.\n\n2. **File Location and Naming**:\n   - All files are located in a **GUID-named temporary directory** (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`), which is typical for temporary files in Windows.\n   - The DLLs (e.g., `FolderProvider.dll`, `ImagingProvider.dll`, `MsiProvider.dll`) appear to be **component-specific modules** that might be part of a legitimate deployment or imaging process.\n\n3. **Potential Red Flags**:\n   - **High Volume of DLLs**: The sheer number of DLLs (16 files) being detected by the same rule (`FileExecutableDetected`) could indicate unusual behavior, especially if these files are not part of a standard `Dism` operation.\n   - **DLL Execution**: While `Dism` may load DLLs during its operations, the **`FileExecutableDetected`** rule typically triggers for executable files (`.exe`, `.dll`), which might be overly broad or context-dependent.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Worth Investigating?**\n- **Yes**, but **context is critical**:\n  - If the system is undergoing a **legitimate deployment, imaging, or update**, this could be normal.\n  - If the system is **not in the middle of such an operation**, the presence of these files might warrant further scrutiny (e.g., checking for unexpected processes, unexpected network activity, or unauthorized changes to the system).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**:\n1. **Verify Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signatures** of the DLLs to confirm they are signed by Microsoft or a trusted source.\n   - Compare the **hashes** of these files against known-good repositories (e.g., Microsoft's official hashes).\n\n2. **Correlate with System Activity**:\n   - Look for **recent deployment or imaging events** (e.g., `DISM` commands, `sysprep`, or `image` operations).\n   - Check for **unusual process behavior** (e.g., `Dism.exe` interacting with unexpected files or network resources).\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - If these files are **not associated with a known deployment**, investigate further for signs of **malware persistence** (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks, or hidden processes).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile the logs do not definitively indicate malicious activity, the **high volume of DLLs** and their **temporary storage** warrant **further investigation**, especially if the system is not undergoing a legitimate deployment. This could be a **false positive** (due to overly broad detection rules) or a **potential indicator of compromise** depending on the broader context."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a lot of activity related to Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The first event shows Dism.exe detecting a file executable, which is WimProvider.dll in the Temp directory. Then, DismHost.exe is loading several DLLs, all of which are in the same Temp folder. \n\nNow, Dism and DismHost are part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment tool, typically used for tasks like deploying Windows images. However, the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from the Temp directory might be suspicious. Legitimate use of Dism usually involves system image files, but loading multiple DLLs from a temporary location could indicate something else, like a malicious payload being executed.\n\nAlso, the last event shows Dism.exe deleting one of the DLLs (AppxProvider.dll) after it's been used. This could be part of a normal process, but combined with the numerous image loads from Temp, it raises a red flag. Typically, if a process is loading many DLLs from Temp, especially ones that aren't standard, it might be a sign of an attack. \n\nI should check if these DLLs are known good files. But since the user hasn't provided that info, I have to rely on the context. The fact that the files are in the Temp directory and being loaded by DismHost.exe, which is a legitimate process, might be a technique used by malware to execute code in memory without leaving files on the disk. However, the deletion of the file after use could be an attempt to clean up, which is common in malicious activities.\n\nBut wait, DismHost.exe is a legitimate process, and it's possible that these DLLs are part of a legitimate deployment task. However, the sheer number of DLLs being loaded from the same Temp directory seems unusual. In a normal scenario, you might see a few DLLs, but 14 different ones? That seems excessive. \n\nAnother point is the initial detection of the file by Dism.exe. If this is part of a normal deployment, why would the file be deleted afterward? Maybe it's part of a temporary setup. But without more context, like the system's configuration or the user's actions, it's hard to say. However, the combination of multiple DLL loads from Temp and the deletion might be indicative of a malicious process. \n\nI should also consider that the user might be looking for signs of compromise. The events here could be part of a legitimate process, but they also fit the pattern of suspicious behavior. Since the answer requires determining if this is a security threat, the presence of multiple DLLs from Temp, along with file creation and deletion, leans towards a potential threat. However, I need to be cautious not to overstate it, as it could be a legitimate use case. But given the information, the risk is high enough to flag it as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe sequence of events observed involves **Dism.exe** and **DismHost.exe** interacting with multiple DLL files in a temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). While these processes are legitimate tools for Windows deployment and imaging, the behavior described raises **significant security concerns**. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Unusual Volume of DLL Loads**:\n   - **DismHost.exe** loads **14+ DLLs** (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `SmiProvider.dll`, `UnattendProvider.dll`) from the same temporary directory. This is highly unusual for standard Dism operations, which typically involve fewer, well-known system DLLs.\n\n2. **Temporary Directory Usage**:\n   - The files are stored in a **temporary directory**, which is a common tactic for malware to evade detection. Legitimate processes rarely load numerous DLLs from `Temp` unless explicitly configured for dynamic module loading (which is rare and usually documented).\n\n3. **File Deletion After Use**:\n   - **Dism.exe** deletes one of the loaded DLLs (`AppxProvider.dll`) after the process terminates. This behavior mimics **malware cleanup routines**, where files are deleted to avoid forensic traces.\n\n4. **Lack of Contextual Legitimacy**:\n   - None of the loaded DLLs (e.g., `UnattendProvider.dll`, `SmiProvider.dll`) are standard system components. While some names (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`) relate to Windows features, their presence in a temporary directory and mass loading suggest **possible tampering**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat**\n- **Malware Emulation**: The behavior aligns with **malware using legitimate tools (like Dism) as a dropper** to execute payloads in memory, avoiding disk-based detection.\n- **Living Off the Land**: The use of built-in tools (Dism\/DismHost) combined with temporary file operations is a **common technique in advanced persistent threats (APTs)** to blend in with normal system activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate Further**:\n   - Check the **hashes of the loaded DLLs** to confirm if they match known malicious samples.\n   - Analyze **process memory dumps** of DismHost.exe to detect injected code or anomalous behavior.\n   - Review **system logs** for additional context (e.g., user activity, parent processes).\n\n2. **Containment**:\n   - If this is a real-world scenario, **isolate the affected system** and block network traffic from the process until the threat is confirmed.\n\n3. **Preventive Measures**:\n   - Monitor **unusual file operations** in `Temp` directories.\n   - Use **EDR\/XDR solutions** to detect anomalous behavior by legitimate tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **Dism.exe** and **DismHost.exe** are legitimate, the **abnormal volume of DLL loads from a temporary directory**, coupled with **file deletion**, strongly suggests **malicious activity**. This warrants immediate investigation and mitigation. \n\n**Classification**: **High-risk suspicious activity** (potential malware execution)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The main activity here is a series of file deletions and one file creation time change. The files being deleted are in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder, which is common for temporary files.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Dism.exe is known to be used in system updates and image management. Deleting temporary files in the Temp directory is a normal part of its operation, especially after installing updates or applying patches. The fact that multiple files are being deleted might be part of a cleanup process. However, the presence of .mui files (which are language-specific resource files) and the deletion of both .dll and .mui files could indicate that the system is removing old or unused components.\n\nBut wait, why is this potentially suspicious? Well, if Dism.exe is deleting files that are not supposed to be there, or if this is happening outside of a normal update scenario, it could be a red flag. However, in this case, since all the files are in the Temp directory and are part of a single GUID folder, it's more likely that these are temporary files created during a system process and are being cleaned up afterward. The fact that the same process is involved in both deleting and changing the creation time of a file might be part of a legitimate operation, such as replacing or updating a file.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any unusual pattern. For example, if these deletions are happening frequently or if there are other suspicious activities around the same time. But based solely on the provided logs, there's no indication of that. The process is legitimate, the files are in a temporary directory, and the actions are consistent with cleanup operations.\n\nSo, while it's important to monitor Dism.exe activity, especially if it's performing unexpected actions, the current logs don't show any clear signs of malicious behavior. It's more likely a normal system cleanup. Still, in a real-world scenario, further investigation into the context of these deletions (like checking for related events or system changes) would be necessary to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate a series of file deletions and a single file creation time modification performed by the **`Dism.exe`** process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment, imaging, and system updates. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Context**:\n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a trusted system utility, commonly involved in Windows Update operations, image management, and system configuration changes. Its activity here is not inherently suspicious.\n\n2. **File Activity**:\n   - **Files Deleted**: Multiple `.dll` and `.mui` (language-specific resource files) are being deleted from the **`%TEMP%`** directory under a GUID-based folder (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B698D89`).\n   - **File Creation Time Change**: One file (`AssocProvider.dll`) had its creation time modified. This could indicate a file replacement or update.\n\n3. **Location and Pattern**:\n   - All files are in the **temporary directory**, which is typical for intermediate files during system operations (e.g., updates, deployments).\n   - The use of a GUID-based folder suggests these files were generated during a specific system process (e.g., an update or imaging task).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimacy Assessment**\n- **Normal Behavior**: \n  - **`Dism.exe`** frequently deletes temporary files during operations like applying updates, repairing system images, or cleaning up residual files. The deletion of `.dll` and `.mui` files in the Temp directory is consistent with such tasks.\n  - The modification of a file's creation time could be part of a legitimate update process (e.g., replacing an outdated file).\n\n- **No Red Flags**:\n  - No evidence of unauthorized access, unexpected file paths, or unusual process behavior.\n  - The activity aligns with **post-update cleanup** or **image deployment** operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns (If Any)**\n- **Context Matters**: If this activity occurs **outside** of a known system update or imaging task, it could warrant further investigation. However, the logs provided do not indicate such a scenario.\n- **Correlation with Other Events**: If this is part of a larger set of suspicious activities (e.g., unauthorized access, malware detection), further analysis would be required.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** and part of a normal system cleanup or update process performed by **`Dism.exe`**. No immediate security threats are evident from the logs alone. However, monitoring for **unusual timing** or **correlation with other events** (e.g., unexpected system changes, user activity) is advisable for comprehensive security.\n\n**Verdict**: **Not Suspicious** (normal system behavior)."}

It's common during system setup or updates. However, the fact that so many files are being deleted in quick succession might be suspicious. But wait, maybe this is part of a normal process, like cleaning up temporary files after an image deployment.\n\nThe path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files. The UUID suggests that this might be part of a specific operation, perhaps a system image deployment or a Windows Update. However, the deletion of multiple MUI files could be part of removing old language packs or components that are no longer needed.\n\nBut here's the thing: if this were malicious, the attacker might be trying to remove evidence or delete system files to compromise the system. However, Dism.exe is a legitimate process, so unless there's an unusual context, like these deletions happening outside of a known legitimate operation, it might not be malicious. \n\nHowever, the high number of deletions (15 files) could indicate something.

The fact that all these files are MUI files might be part of a language-specific cleanup. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is not running a system deployment or update, this could be unusual. But the logs don't provide context about the system's state. The user might be running a legitimate operation, so the deletions are normal. \n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because Dism.exe is a legitimate process, and the deletions are in the Temp directory, which is expected during system operations.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process deleting files in the temporary directory under a specific UUID folder. The files being deleted are various DLLs, some of which seem to be part of Windows Imaging or setup providers.\n\nFirst, I know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. It's common during system setup or image customization. However, the fact that multiple files are being deleted in a short period might be noteworthy. But wait, the user mentioned that these are all delete events logged by the FileDeleteDetected rule. \n\nNow, considering the location: the files are in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a common temporary storage area. Legitimate processes often use this directory for temporary files. The UUID in the path suggests that this might be part of a specific operation or session, possibly a one-time process like a system image deployment or a clean installation.\n\nBut why so many files? Let me think. When using DISM, especially with commands like \/Apply-Image or \/Mount-Wim, it's possible that temporary files are created and then deleted after the operation. The presence of multiple provider DLLs (like ImagingProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll) might be part of the DISM's internal components that are used during these operations. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity. The process is Dism.exe, which is legitimate. The files are in the Temp folder, which is expected. The deletion is part of a normal operation. Unless there's an unusual pattern, like deletion of non-temporary files or deletion by a non-legitimate process, this might just be normal system activity.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is whether the combination of events is suspicious. Since all events are from a legitimate process, in a temporary directory, and the files are related to DISM's operations, it's likely normal. However, if there were no prior events indicating the creation of these files, just deletions, that might be a red flag. But the data given here only includes deletions. \n\nIn some cases, attackers might use legitimate processes to delete files, but without more context (like unusual command-line arguments, unexpected parent processes, or other anomalous behavior), it's hard to tell. But based solely on the information provided, the deletions by Dism.exe in the Temp directory seem to be part of normal system operations. \n\nTherefore, I think this might not be a security incident. The events are likely benign, part of a system image deployment or similar legitimate activity. But the answer should note that without additional context, it's hard to be certain, but the current data doesn't indicate a threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **Dism.exe** process deleting multiple DLL files located in a temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{UUID}`) under a specific session identifier. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process**:  \n   - **Dism.exe** is a legitimate Windows utility used for deploying and managing Windows images (e.g., during imaging, sysprep, or deployment scenarios). It is expected to create and delete temporary files during operations.\n\n2. **File Location and Context**:  \n   - The files are in the `Temp` directory, which is a standard location for temporary files during system operations.  \n   - The `{UUID}` folder suggests these files were created as part of a specific session or operation (e.g., a DISM command like `\/Apply-Image` or `\/Mount-Wim`).\n\n3. **File Types**:  \n   - The deleted files (e.g., `ImagingProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`) are associated with Windows Imaging and deployment tools. Their deletion could be part of a normal cleanup after a DISM operation.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Might Be **Not** Suspicious**\n- **Expected Behavior**:  \n  DISM often generates temporary files during image deployment, customization, or sysprep. Deleting these files post-operation is a normal part of the process.\n- **No Anomalies in the Data**:  \n  - No indication of unusual command-line arguments, unexpected parent processes, or non-standard behavior in the logs provided.\n  - The files are in a temporary directory, which is consistent with legitimate system activity.\n\n---\n\n### **When This Might Be Suspicious**\n- **Lack of Context**:  \n  If these deletions occurred **without prior creation** of the files (e.g., no logs of the files being written to disk), it could indicate tampering or cleanup of malicious payloads.\n- **Unusual Patterns**:  \n  If this activity occurred **outside** of a known deployment or imaging scenario (e.g., on a non-DC, non-VM, or production system), it might warrant further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**Classification**: Likely **benign**, but **context-dependent**.  \n**Recommendation**:  \n- If this is part of a known deployment\/sysprep operation, no action is needed.  \n- If the activity is unexpected or lacks context (e.g., no prior imaging operations), investigate further by checking:  \n  - DISM command-line arguments (via process tree or event logs).  \n  - Whether the UUID folder contains residual files or logs.  \n  - Correlation with other system events (e.g., process creation, network activity).  \n\nWithout additional evidence, this appears to be **normal system behavior**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries that look like log data from a Windows system, probably from something like the Windows Event Log or a security tool. Each entry has a \"process\" field, a \"winlog\" field, and a \"file\" field which is \"None\" in all cases. \n\nFirst, I need to parse these entries to understand what's happening. The \"process\" field seems to contain details about the process, like the name or command line. The \"winlog\" field has a \"task\" which indicates the type of event, such as \"Process Create\" or \"Registry value set\". The \"file\" field being \"None\" might mean that no file was involved in the event, or that the data source doesn't include file information.\n\nLooking at the entries, there are several instances where the process is \"svchost.exe\" with a \"Registry value set\" event. That might be a normal system activity since svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes could be part of service configuration. However, it's also possible that this is part of a larger pattern of activity.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with the same command line for powershell.exe. The command line is using New-Service and Start-Service to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". This seems suspicious because creating a new service via PowerShell might be an attempt to install a backdoor or malicious software. The binary path is in a directory named \"unidade_logico\", which doesn't sound like a standard Windows directory. Also, the fact that this is done through PowerShell with the ExecutionPolicy Restricted might be a way to bypass certain restrictions, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe repeated entries for \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" might be related to the logging system itself, indicating that the provider or engine is starting or stopping. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same command line is repeated multiple times. This could be a sign of a script that's being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a loop or an attempt to ensure the service is created and started correctly. However, it's also possible that the logging system is capturing the same event multiple times, which might be a configuration issue.\n\nThe final entries have a different command line for powershell.exe, which writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. This might be a test command or part of a script that's indicating success, but again, without more context, it's hard to determine the intent.\n\nPutting this all together, the most concerning part is the creation of a new service with a non-standard binary path using PowerShell. This could be a red flag for potential malicious activity, especially if the \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is not a legitimate system file. The repeated logs might indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure the service is created and running, possibly as part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that this might be part of a legitimate process, such as a software installation or configuration script. The key would be to check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a known legitimate file or if it's associated with any known malicious software. Additionally, looking at the source of the logs, the user, and any other related events could provide more context.\n\nIn summary, the logs show a PowerShell script creating a new service, which is a common technique used in attacks for persistence. The repetition of the same command line might be part of the attack's execution flow, but further investigation is needed to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON logs indicate a sequence of events that may suggest **potentially malicious activity**, particularly around the creation of a new Windows service and the use of PowerShell. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the key points:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - A PowerShell command is repeatedly executed to:\n     - **Create a new service** named `objeto_ativo` with a binary path pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n     - **Start the service** immediately after creation.\n   - **Suspicious Elements**:\n     - The service name (`objeto_ativo`) and binary path (`tarefa_logico.exe`) are not standard Windows components. The directory `unidade_logico` (which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese) is also non-standard and may be a custom or malicious installation location.\n     - The use of `New-Service` and `Start-Service` in a script could be an attempt to **establish persistence** on the system.\n\n2. **Repetition of Events**:\n   - The same PowerShell command is logged **multiple times**, which might indicate:\n     - A **loop in the script** to ensure the service is created and started.\n     - **Log redundancy** due to the logging system capturing the same event multiple times.\n\n3. **Registry Activity**:\n   - The `svchost.exe` process is associated with a **\"Registry value set\"** event. While this is normal for service management, it could also be part of **malicious configuration changes**.\n\n4. **Execution Policy Context**:\n   - The use of `PowerShell` with `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is notable. This policy typically prevents scripts from running unless explicitly allowed. However, if the attacker bypassed this (e.g., via `Bypass` or `RemoteSigned`), it may indicate **attempted elevation of privileges**.\n\n5. **Final Test Command**:\n   - A final PowerShell command writes `\"Final result: 1\"` to the host. This could be a **test** to confirm the script's success or part of a **malicious payload** indicating execution completion.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: Creating a new service is a common technique used by attackers to **maintain access** to a system after initial compromise.\n- **Malware Installation**: The binary `tarefa_logico.exe` is not a known legitimate Windows component. If this file is not part of a trusted application, it could be **malware** (e.g., a backdoor, keylogger, or C2 component).\n- **Lateral Movement**: If the service is part of a larger attack chain, it could be used to **spread to other systems** in the network.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Investigate the File**:\n   - Check if `tarefa_logico.exe` exists in the specified path.\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Windows Defender** to scan the file for malicious behavior.\n   - Analyze the file’s **hash** and **digital signature** (if any) to determine its legitimacy.\n\n2. **Review System Logs**:\n   - Look for related events (e.g., **process creation**, **network connections**, **user logins**) around the time of these logs.\n   - Check the **Windows Security Log** for **failed login attempts**, **privilege use**, or **unusual activity**.\n\n3. **Check for Unauthorized Services**:\n   - Use the command `sc query` or the **Services Manager** (`services.msc`) to verify if the `objeto_ativo` service is running.\n   - If it is, investigate its **startup type**, **description**, and **owner**.\n\n4. **Secure PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Ensure the system’s **execution policy** is set to a restrictive level (e.g., `RemoteSigned` or `AllSigned`) to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n   - Monitor for **unusual PowerShell activity** (e.g., use of `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, or `Start-Process` with suspicious URLs).\n\n5. **Network Monitoring**:\n   - Check if `tarefa_logico.exe` is communicating with external IPs or domains. Use tools like **Wireshark**, **Microsoft Defender ATP**, or **SIEM systems** for network traffic analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs suggest **potentially malicious behavior** involving the creation of a new service via PowerShell. While some activity (e.g., `svchost.exe` and registry changes) is normal for Windows, the repeated service creation and non-standard file paths are **red flags**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a **legitimate process** or an **attack**. If the file `tarefa_logico.exe` is confirmed to be malicious, immediate **removal** and **system hardening** are necessary."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process command lines, most of them are PowerShell commands with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The first few entries have simple Write-Host commands, which might just be testing or benign scripts. But then there's a pattern where the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times, specifically scanning INF files in the Windows directory for certain sections like [defaultinstall.nt...]. \n\nThe command is checking for the presence of specific sections in INF files, which are typically used for driver installations. The regex matches different architectures (amd64, arm, etc.), so the script is looking for defaultinstall sections across various OS versions. \n\nNow, why would this be suspicious? Well, INF files can be part of legitimate software installations, but scanning them in this way might be part of a process to detect or install drivers. However, if this is happening in a non-expected context, it could be malicious. But the command itself doesn't have any obvious malicious content like downloading files, executing other scripts, or modifying the system. \n\nWait, but the repetition of the same command across multiple events might indicate that this is part of a scan or a check that's being run multiple times. However, the fact that it's using the Restricted ExecutionPolicy could be a red flag. Normally, Restricted is the default, so it's not necessarily bad. But if the script is trying to bypass that, but in this case, it's explicitly set to Restricted.\n\nAnother point is that the script is reading INF files, which could be part of a legitimate process, but if this is happening in a system where such scans aren't expected, it might be worth looking into. However, without more context like other events or file changes, it's hard to say. \n\nBut the same command is repeated multiple times. Maybe it's part of a larger process that's being monitored. However, the justification for being interesting would be the repeated scanning of INF files, which could be part of a malicious activity like checking for vulnerabilities or preparing for an exploit. However, the command itself doesn't seem to do anything harmful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of a legitimate tool that checks for driver installations. But without more information, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that the same command is run multiple times might be a sign of something automated. \n\nConsidering that the first few events are benign, but the later ones are the same repeated command, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious intent. But I'm a bit conflicted. The repetition could be normal, but the scanning of INF files might be part of a larger process. However, since there's no evidence of malicious activity beyond the scanning, maybe it's not interesting. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that the script is using PowerShell with Restricted policy and checking INF files might be a red flag. But again, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The confidence might be around 0.5, but since the user wants a classification, maybe it's better to say \"NOT INTERESTING\" with the justification that the commands are benign and part of normal system checks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve benign PowerShell commands with Restricted ExecutionPolicy, including checks for INF file sections which are legitimate system operations. No malicious activity or anomalous patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
