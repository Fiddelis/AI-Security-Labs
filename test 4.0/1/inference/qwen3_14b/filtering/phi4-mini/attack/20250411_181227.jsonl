{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries, mostly related to PowerShell processes and scheduled tasks.\n\nFirst, looking at the process command lines. There's a pattern here: multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with 'calc.exe' as the action. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to 'BUILTIN\\Administrators' with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running calc.exe (which is a legitimate calculator) via scheduled tasks with admin rights could be a way to execute arbitrary code. The use of 'Register-ScheduledTask' with different task names suggests someone is trying to create multiple scheduled tasks, which might be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nAlso, there are several entries with 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' events, which could indicate changes to the registry or access to sensitive processes. The 'Image loaded' events point to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, if these are being loaded in an unexpected context, that might be suspicious.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The repeated creation of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and using calc.exe might be a sign of someone trying to establish persistence. However, calc.exe is a normal application, so maybe this is a false positive. But the fact that it's being scheduled to run at logon with admin rights is unusual. Also, the multiple task names (unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.) might be part of a larger campaign.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events could be part of the attack chain, like modifying registry keys to ensure the task runs or accessing other processes. The presence of multiple PowerShell events might indicate an attacker using PowerShell for malicious activities, which is common in attacks.\n\nHowever, there's also a Chrome.exe event related to a pipe created, which might be unrelated. But the majority of the events are about PowerShell and scheduled tasks. The confidence here is high because the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and using PowerShell is a known technique in attacks. Even though calc.exe is benign, the context here is suspicious. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators, RunLevel Highest) that execute calc.exe at user logon.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading images like mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack to execute malicious code without leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might be a sign of something malicious. Then, looking at the command line for powershell.exe, there's a script that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe with high privileges for Administrators. That's definitely suspicious. Creating a scheduled task with such settings could be an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets. If that's normal behavior for chrome, maybe not, but if there's a lot of registry changes, it could be something else. However, the majority of the logs are about powershell and the scheduled task. Also, there are several 'Execute a Remote Command' events with the process as None, which might indicate that the system is trying to log something but the process isn't captured, possibly due to a security bypass.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a scheduled task with high privileges, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the remote command executions are all signs that could indicate a security incident. Even though some entries are normal, the combination of these events makes this batch interesting enough to investigate further. The confidence is high because the scheduled task with admin rights is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators) to execute calc.exe, temporary file creation\/deletion, and potential remote command execution attempts. These patterns suggest possible privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading a file called taskschd.dll from System32. That's a legitimate Windows process, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, so that's normal. Not suspicious here.\n\nThen there are several entries with svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values can be normal, but repeated changes might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But there are multiple instances here, so maybe that's worth noting.\n\nNext, there's an event where a process is None, and the task is executing a remote command. That's unusual because the process field is empty. Executing a remote command without a known process could indicate something malicious, like a command being run by a service or a hidden process. That's a potential indicator of compromise.\n\nThen, PowerShell.exe is creating files in the user's AppData directory. Creating files in AppData is common for legitimate activities, but depending on the files, it could be suspicious. The filenames here seem generic, but maybe not immediately harmful.\n\nAnother PowerShell event creates a file in the Downloads directory. That's more benign, but again, depends on the content. Then, Chrome.exe is involved in several registry changes and a DNS query. Chrome doing registry changes might not be normal, but it's possible if extensions are involved. The DNS query could be part of normal browsing, but if it's pointing to a suspicious domain, that would be a problem. However, the event doesn't specify the domain, so I can't tell yet.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal during setup. But if it's not expected, maybe that's an issue. However, the filename suggests it's part of a configuration process.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, the most suspicious part is the event with the process being None and executing a remote command. That's a red flag because it indicates an unknown process performing an action, which could be a sign of a hidden or malicious process. Additionally, the multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and Chrome.exe might be part of a larger pattern, but without more context, it's hard to confirm.\n\nHowever, the presence of a remote command execution without a clear process is a strong indicator of something unusual. Even though other events might be normal, that single event raises a flag. The confidence isn't 100% because there's not enough information, but it's enough to consider this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious event where a process is listed as 'None' while executing a remote command, which may indicate a hidden or malicious process. Additionally, multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and Chrome.exe, along with file creation in user directories, suggest potential lateral movement or configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
