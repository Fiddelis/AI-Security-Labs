A file created in WindowsUpdate logs, which is standard. Taskhostw loading taskschd.dll, part of Task Scheduler, so okay.\n\nSvchost.exe changing a registry value. That's common for system services. The PowerShell command is checking INF files for defaultinstall sections. Maybe looking for something, but not obviously malicious. Another file created by PowerShell in the systemprofile's AppData, which could be normal or part of a script.\n\nChrome doing a DNS query, which is normal. Winlogbeat creating a YAML file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's expected. Chrome changing a registry value again. CompatTelRunner loading taskschd.dll again, which is okay.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe (Windows Defender) loading its own DLLs. Then, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a temporary Edge installer file. That's part of an update process. MpCmdRun creating a lock file in Windows Temp, which is normal for Defender operations.\n\nLooking for suspicious patterns: multiple processes related to Edge and Defender, but most are legitimate.

The user provided a bunch of JSON events, all related to files being created by git.exe in the node_modules directory.

Git is a version control system, so it's common for it to create files during clone, pull, or checkout operations. The files mentioned are in node_modules, which is where npm packages are installed. So, this could be part of a normal npm install or git clone process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be standard files for npm packages: index.js, package.json, tsconfig.json, etc. These are typical files you'd find in a node module. The directories like set-function-length, shebang-command, shebang-regex, and side-channel are names of npm packages. So, it looks like git is creating these files as part of installing dependencies.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's anything suspicious. For example, if git.exe was creating files in unusual locations or if there were a large number of files created rapidly, that might be a red flag. But in this case, all the events are in the node_modules folder, which is expected during an npm install. Also, the process is git.exe, which is legitimate. There's no mention of other processes or unexpected file types.\n\nThe only thing that might be a bit unusual is the number of events, but considering that node_modules can have many packages, this could be normal.

The files mentioned are typical for a Node.js project, like package.json, license files, readme.md, and various JavaScript files. The directories like 'bin' and 'lib' are common in npm packages.\n\nNow, considering that git.exe is creating these files, it's possible that this is part of a normal git operation, such as cloning a repository or checking out a branch. The presence of multiple files being created in a structured way (like the hierarchy under node_modules) suggests that this might be part of a legitimate process, maybe installing dependencies or initializing a project.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any suspicious pattern. All the events are from the same process (git.exe), and the files are all in the same directory structure. There's no indication of unusual activity like unexpected file types, access to sensitive areas, or multiple processes involved. Since the files are standard for a Node.js project, and the process is git.exe, which is a common tool, this seems like a normal operation.\n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers might use git to exfiltrate data or inject malicious code.
