{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries here are about files being created, specifically by a process called SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files named officeaicopilot-strings.min_... with various hashes. They're located in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles directory under a Microsoft Office SolutionPackages folder. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. It's possible it's a legitimate part of some software, maybe related to Office, but I'm not sure. The fact that so many files are being created in a specific directory might be normal for some application, but the repetition of the same file names with different hashes makes me think. Wait, some of the files are duplicated. For example, there are entries for min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js appearing twice. But maybe that's just multiple creation events for the same file, or maybe it's a typo or error in logging.\n\nBut then there's one entry that stands out: the one with the task \"Security Group Management\" and process null. That's unusual because it's not a file creation event and doesn't mention a process. That might be a different type of security event, possibly related to group changes or permissions, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the rest of the logs are about file creation, this might be a red herring or a separate event that's not directly related.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of malware. Malware often creates a lot of files, especially in temporary or user-specific directories. The fact that all these files are in a Microsoft Office directory could indicate that they're part of a legitimate update or installation, but the name \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" is a bit odd. \"AICopilot\" might be a typo or a misinterpretation. Maybe it's \"AI Copilot,\" which is a feature in newer Office versions. If that's the case, these files could be part of an update. However, the repetition and the specific naming might be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the process SDXHelper.exe. If I can't find information on what that process does, it might be a good idea to check if it's a known legitimate process. If not, that could be a sign of something malicious. Also, the fact that there are so many files created in a short period might be indicative of a payload being deployed.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to be certain. The presence of a non-file event (Security Group Management) might be unrelated, but it's worth noting. However, the majority of the logs are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe. If this is a legitimate process, then the logs might be normal. If not, then it could be a problem.\n\nIn the absence of clear indicators of compromise, but given the unusual process name and the volume of file creations, this might be worth further investigation. The answer would be that this is interesting because of the repeated file creations by an unknown process and the presence of a different security event. However, more context would be needed to confirm if it's malicious or legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively indicative of malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Process:** A large number of JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) are created in the directory `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n   - **Pattern:** The files share a naming convention with unique hashes, suggesting they might be part of a software update, localization package, or dynamic content generation. However, the repetition of identical file names (e.g., `min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js` appearing twice) could indicate redundant operations or logging anomalies.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Name (`SDXHelper.exe`):**\n   - **Legitimacy Unclear:** While `SDXHelper.exe` is not a widely recognized Microsoft Office component, it could be a legitimate utility for a third-party application or a new feature (e.g., AI Copilot in Office 365). However, the lack of public documentation raises concerns.\n\n3. **Outlier Event: \"Security Group Management\":**\n   - **Context Missing:** This event lacks process or file details, which is atypical for most log entries. It could represent a legitimate security-related activity (e.g., group policy changes), but the absence of additional context makes it difficult to assess.\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual File Volume:** The creation of numerous files in a short period might indicate data exfiltration, payload deployment, or a benign but resource-intensive operation (e.g., software installation).\n- **Process Anomalies:** If `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known legitimate process, it could be a placeholder for malware or a rogue application.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy:**\n   - Check the digital signature of `SDXHelper.exe` (if present) and cross-reference it with Microsoft's official resources or trusted antivirus databases.\n   - Monitor system behavior (e.g., network traffic, registry changes) associated with this process.\n\n2. **Investigate File Purpose:**\n   - Analyze the contents of the generated `.js` files (if accessible) to determine their purpose (e.g., localization strings, scripts for a feature).\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Cross-reference this activity with system logs, application logs, or network traffic to identify contextual clues (e.g., communication with external servers, user interactions).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not conclusively indicate malicious activity, the combination of repetitive file creation by an obscure process and the lack of transparency around `SDXHelper.exe` warrants further scrutiny. This could be a legitimate operation (e.g., a new Office feature) or a potential security risk. **Further investigation is recommended** to confirm the nature of these activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this log. There are a bunch of entries here, mostly from SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. There's also one entry from chrome.exe setting a registry value.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on here. The user is probably asking whether this is normal behavior or if there's something suspicious. Let me break it down.\n\nSDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that exact process name. Maybe it's part of some software? Let me think. Sometimes, helper processes are used by applications for various tasks. But I should check if this is a legitimate process. If it's part of a known application, like maybe a Microsoft Office add-in or something related to the SolutionPackages folder, that might be normal. However, the name \"SDXHelper\" doesn't ring a bell immediately. I might need to do a quick check on what SDXHelper.exe is, but since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on existing knowledge.\n\nLooking at the files being created: they all have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js. The \"aicopilot\" part is interesting. Could that be a typo or a specific application? Maybe \"AICopilot\" is some software, but I'm not sure. The \".min.js\" suggests it's a minified JavaScript file, which is common in web applications. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating these files in the Office directory? That seems odd. Office typically doesn't use JavaScript files in that location, unless it's part of some add-in or customization.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe entry. Setting a registry value might be normal if it's part of Chrome's own operations, but I need to consider context. If Chrome is being controlled by another process, that could be a red flag. However, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, looking at the repetition of file creation. The same files are being created multiple times. For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js appears twice. That might be normal if the process is retrying or if it's part of an installation, but repeated creation of the same file could also be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or a downloader that's generating files repeatedly.\n\nAnother thing to note is the path: C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\... This is a legitimate directory for some Office solutions, but again, the presence of JavaScript files there is unusual. Office solutions might use XML or other formats, not JavaScript.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process but being used maliciously. Maybe it's a legitimate helper process that's been compromised. Alternatively, it could be a rogue process masquerading as a helper.\n\nThe fact that there's a registry event from Chrome might be unrelated, but it's worth considering if there's any connection between the Chrome activity and the SDXHelper actions. However, without more data, it's speculative.\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n\n1. Repeated creation of JavaScript files in an unusual directory by SDXHelper.exe.\n2. The name SDXHelper.exe is not immediately recognizable as a standard process.\n3. The presence of a registry event from Chrome, though context is needed.\n\nPotential issues: Unusual file creation, possible malware activity, or a legitimate process being used in an unexpected way.\n\nRecommendations: Check the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe by verifying its digital signature, checking the file location, and researching the process name. Also, scan the system for malware, review the registry changes from Chrome, and consider the overall system behavior for any signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entry you provided indicates activity involving multiple processes and file operations, some of which may be benign or suspicious depending on context. Here's a structured analysis and recommendation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` is creating numerous `.min.js` files (minified JavaScript) in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory (`C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`).\n   - **Unusual Behavior:** \n     - JavaScript files are not typical in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is usually reserved for XML-based add-ins or Office solutions.\n     - The same files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js`) are created multiple times, which could indicate retries, corruption, or malicious activity (e.g., a dropper generating files).\n\n2. **Registry Event from `chrome.exe`:**\n   - A single entry shows `chrome.exe` setting a registry value. This could be normal (e.g., Chrome updating settings) but requires context to determine legitimacy.\n\n3. **Unidentified Process:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a widely recognized Windows process. Its legitimacy depends on:\n     - **Digital Signature:** Check if the file is signed by a trusted entity.\n     - **File Location:** Verify if it's in a system directory (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`) or a user-specific path (e.g., `AppData`).\n     - **Behavior:** Unusual activity (e.g., repeated file creation) may indicate a compromised or rogue process.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Malware Indicators:**\n  - **Unusual File Types and Locations:** JavaScript files in Office directories are highly atypical.\n  - **Repetition:** Repeated creation of the same files may suggest malicious behavior, such as a dropper or downloader.\n  - **Unrecognized Process:** Lack of visibility into `SDXHelper.exe` increases suspicion.\n\n- **Legitimate Possibilities:**\n  - **Custom Office Add-ins:** If the files are part of a legitimate add-in or customization, they might be named `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` (though this is speculative).\n  - **Third-Party Software:** `SDXHelper.exe` could be a helper process for a legitimate application, though its presence in the Office directory is unusual.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Check File Properties:**\n     - Right-click the executable > **Properties** > **Digital Signatures** tab.\n     - If unsigned or signed by an unknown entity, investigate further.\n   - **Research the Process:**\n     - Use tools like [Malwarebytes](https:\/\/www.malwarebytes.com\/) or [Process Explorer](https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/downloads\/process-explorer) to analyze the process.\n     - Search online for `SDXHelper.exe` to confirm if it's associated with known software.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/anti-malware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - Use **Windows Defender Offline** to detect deeply embedded threats.\n\n3. **Investigate the Registry Change:**\n   - Review the registry key modified by `chrome.exe` to determine if it's related to legitimate Chrome operations or unauthorized changes.\n\n4. **Monitor System Behavior:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** (Sysinternals) to track file and registry activity by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Check for network connections or unusual outbound traffic.\n\n5. **Check for Office Add-ins:**\n   - If `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` is part of an Office add-in, confirm its source and legitimacy through Microsoft's documentation or your organization's IT policies.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe repeated creation of JavaScript files in an Office directory by an unrecognized process (`SDXHelper.exe`) raises concerns about potential malware. While some activity could be legitimate, the lack of context and unusual behavior warrant further investigation. Immediate steps include verifying the process's legitimacy, scanning for malware, and monitoring system activity. If `SDXHelper.exe` is confirmed to be malicious, remove it and take steps to secure the system."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files with names that all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by some random-looking hexadecimal strings. The task is to determine if this is a security threat or not. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Windows Search service, specifically related to the Search Indexer. It's responsible for indexing files and making searches faster. So, normally, it's a legitimate process. But sometimes, malware can mimic legitimate processes to avoid detection. \n\nLooking at the file names, they all have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which seems like a JavaScript or JSON minified file, maybe related to some application or website. However, the presence of a lot of these files being created in the \"OfflineFiles\" directory under the user's AppData might be suspicious. \n\nWait, the \"OfflineFiles\" directory is typically used by Windows for caching files from network locations. But if SDXHelper is creating a large number of files there, that might be unusual. Also, the fact that all the files have the same naming pattern with different hashes might indicate that they are being generated as part of some automated process, possibly by malware.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any known legitimate use of SDXHelper creating such files. Maybe it's part of an application that's indexing or processing a lot of data. But the naming convention here seems odd. Legitimate files might have more descriptive names. Also, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the location of the files. The path is \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OfflineFiles\". If this is a normal directory for Windows, then maybe it's legitimate. But if the files are being created in a different location or if there are other unusual processes running alongside, that's a concern.\n\nI should also think about the number of files. There are 16 entries here, which might be normal if it's part of a background process. However, if this is happening frequently or if there are thousands of such files, that's more suspicious. \n\nAnother angle: checking if the process SDXHelper.exe is running from the expected location. The legitimate SDXHelper.exe is usually located in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\SearchFilterHost.exe\" or similar paths. If the process is running from a different location, that's a sign of malware.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the files are named with \"officeaicopilot\" might be a reference to a specific application or service. If that's a known legitimate application, then it might be okay. But if \"officeaicopilot\" is not a known service, that's suspicious.\n\nI should also consider checking for any other signs of malware, such as high CPU or memory usage by SDXHelper, unexpected network activity, or changes in system behavior. However, the user hasn't provided that information, so I have to rely solely on the logs given.\n\nIn conclusion, while SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, the creation of numerous minified files with random hashes in the OfflineFiles directory might indicate a security threat. It's possible that the process is being hijacked by malware to generate and store these files. However, without additional context such as the process's location, system behavior, or other logs, it's challenging to be certain. The best course of action would be to verify the process's authenticity, check for any unexpected activity, and possibly run a malware scan.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that **SDXHelper.exe** (a legitimate Windows process related to the Search Indexer) is creating numerous files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>` in the `OfflineFiles` directory. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is part of **Windows Search** and typically resides in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\SearchFilterHost.exe` or similar paths. It is **legitimate** and responsible for indexing files for faster searches.\n- However, **malware can mimic this process** by renaming itself or running from non-standard locations.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Suspicious Behavior in the Logs**\n- **File Naming Pattern**: The files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`, which is unusual for legitimate system processes. This pattern suggests **automated generation** of files, possibly for **data exfiltration, caching, or malicious payload storage**.\n- **Location**: The files are created in `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OfflineFiles`, a directory used for **caching network files**. While not inherently malicious, **excessive file creation** here could indicate misuse (e.g., malware storing data).\n- **Volume of Files**: 16 files are logged, but if this behavior persists over time or escalates, it may signal **malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Red Flags**\n- **Unusual File Names**: The use of `officeaicopilot` (not a known Windows component) and random hexadecimal hashes in filenames is **atypical for system processes**.\n- **Potential for Hijacking**: If **SDXHelper.exe is running from a non-standard location** (e.g., a temporary directory), it could be a **malware masquerading as a legitimate process**.\n- **Lack of Context**: No logs indicate **user interaction**, **application triggers**, or **legitimate purpose** for these files.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Verify Process Authenticity**:\n  - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe` using Task Manager or `Process Explorer`. If it's not in `C:\\Windows\\System32`, investigate further.\n- **Scan for Malware**:\n  - Run a full system scan with **Windows Defender** or a third-party antivirus to detect potential threats.\n- **Monitor System Behavior**:\n  - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Wireshark** to check for **unexpected network activity**, **file modifications**, or **unusual process interactions**.\n- **Check for Other Indicators**:\n  - Look for **high CPU\/memory usage**, **unexpected services**, or **modified system files**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nWhile **SDXHelper.exe itself is legitimate**, the **unusual file creation behavior** (specifically the naming pattern and location) raises **significant concerns** about potential **malware activity**. This is not definitive proof of a threat, but **further investigation** is warranted to rule out exploitation of the process by malicious actors."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's something suspicious. So, first, I'll go through each entry.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js. That seems like it could be part of a legitimate Office add-in or some kind of localization file. But then again, the names are a bit generic, and the fact that there are so many of them might be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's also an event where chrome.exe sets a registry value. That's a normal activity, but combined with the other events, maybe it's part of a larger process. However, the majority of the events are from SDXHelper.exe. Now, I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the setup or updates. So creating files in the Office directory makes sense for that.\n\nBut why so many files? Maybe it's just a normal update process. However, the repetition of some file names, like the one with min_e8258ccc...js appearing twice, might indicate an error or a loop. Also, the fact that all these files are JavaScript minified files could be a sign of something malicious, like a script being injected. But then again, Office might use JavaScript for add-ins or other purposes.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the location. The files are being created in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles directory under the user's AppData. That's a common location for temporary or cached files. However, if this is part of a legitimate process, there should be some documentation or known behavior about it. If not, it might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the registry event from chrome.exe might be unrelated, but it's worth noting. However, without more context on what registry value was set, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's just a normal setting, like a preference or an update check.\n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events are from a legitimate-sounding process (SDXHelper) creating files in a typical directory. However, the high number of files and the repetitive names could be a sign of something unusual. But without more information, like the presence of malicious code in the files or other suspicious activities, it's hard to confirm. It might just be a normal update or installation process. Still, the sheer volume of file creations might warrant further investigation to ensure there's no malware involved.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events primarily involves **SDXHelper.exe** creating numerous JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js`) in the `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory under the user's AppData. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process?**  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is associated with **Microsoft Office** (e.g., part of the setup or update process). Creating files in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` is typical for temporary or cached resources during installations or updates.\n\n2. **Suspicious Patterns:**  \n   - **High Volume of Files:** Over 20 files created in a short period, all named similarly (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js`). This could indicate a **legitimate update process** (e.g., localized strings for an add-in) or **malicious behavior** (e.g., dropper or payload distribution).\n   - **Repeated File Names:** The same file (`min_e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182.js`) is created twice, which might suggest an error, redundancy, or an attempt to overwrite files.\n\n3. **Registry Event:**  \n   - A **registry value set** by **chrome.exe** is unrelated to the file creation but could indicate normal browser behavior (e.g., updating preferences or extensions). No immediate red flags here.\n\n4. **JavaScript Files:**  \n   - Minified `.js` files are common in legitimate software (e.g., web-based add-ins). However, they could also be used to obfuscate malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks:**\n- **Malware:** If the files contain obfuscated or malicious code, this could be a **download-and-execute** attack. However, no evidence of malicious content is present in the logs.\n- **False Positive:** The activity might be **legitimate**, such as an Office update or add-in installation.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check File Contents:**  \n   - Use a sandbox or virus scanner to analyze the contents of the `.js` files for malicious code (e.g., embedded scripts, URLs, or payloads).\n\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs:**  \n   - Look for additional events (e.g., network connections, process injections) that might indicate malicious activity.\n\n3. **Verify SDXHelper.exe Integrity:**  \n   - Ensure the process is signed by Microsoft and not tampered with (e.g., check digital signatures in Task Manager).\n\n4. **Monitor User Behavior:**  \n   - If the user is experiencing unexpected behavior (e.g., crashes, pop-ups), investigate further.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThe activity is **likely legitimate** (e.g., Office update or add-in setup), but the high volume of files and repetitive names warrant **closer inspection** to rule out malware. No definitive evidence of malicious intent is present in the logs alone."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate system file, so probably normal. Then there's SDXHelper.exe creating several JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Hmm, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard process. Maybe it's part of some software, but creating multiple JS files in that location could be suspicious. Office's SolutionPackages are usually for add-ins, but creating so many files might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking further, chrome.exe is also loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems okay because those are Defender components. But then there are multiple registry value set events by chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag if it's modifying critical keys, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the repeated registry events might be part of normal operations or could be indicative of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe file creation events for the JS files by SDXHelper.exe are in a specific path. The filenames are similar, with different hashes. That might be part of a legitimate update or installation, but the repetition and the location make me think it's not standard. Also, the fact that these files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory under SolutionPackages could be a sign of an add-in or a malicious payload being stored there.\n\nThen there's the Chrome events related to the Excel file \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" with Zone.Identifier streams. Zone.Identifier is used by Windows to mark files downloaded from the internet, which is normal. However, multiple stream creations might be part of normal operations, but it's worth noting.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events involve Chrome and SDXHelper.exe. The Chrome activities seem mostly legitimate, except for the registry changes. The SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files in a non-standard location is more concerning. However, without more context like the origin of SDXHelper.exe, whether it's a known legitimate process, or if the files are malicious, it's a bit ambiguous. But the repetition and the specific paths do raise flags. The confidence is moderate because there are some suspicious elements but not definitive proof of malicious activity. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"Multiple events involving SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory raise suspicion. While Chrome.exe activities (e.g., loading urlmon.dll, creating Zone.Identifier streams) appear legitimate, the repetitive creation of JS files in non-standard locations (e.g., 'OfflineFiles\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_...') suggests potential malicious behavior. SDXHelper.exe is not a well-known system process, and the pattern of file creation may indicate persistence or data exfiltration. Registry modifications by Chrome.exe also warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit unusual. Office typically uses those folders for add-ins or solutions, but creating a JS file there might be normal if it's part of a legitimate add-in. However, the name of the file is a long hash, which could be a sign of something generated automatically or maybe even malicious. Not sure yet, need to check more.\n\nNext, EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are all legitimate system DLLs used by .NET and other components. Loading them is normal during Excel's operation, especially if it's using .NET features or interacting with the web. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's a registry value set by svchost.exe. That's common for system services, so probably nothing to worry about. Another registry event by HxTsr.exe. Hmm, HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should note that. However, the event is a registry value set, which could be benign or malicious. Need to check if there are other events related to this process.\n\nLooking further, SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JS files in the same Office directory. The filenames are again hashes with language codes (like af-za, am-et, etc.). This seems like it's generating localized UI strings, which might be part of a legitimate Office add-in. But the repetition and the use of hashes could be a red flag. Maybe the files are being generated by a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one.\n\nThen there's an event where EXCEL.EXE creates a file stream in a Temp directory. The file is named 1680A406.xlsx. Creating a temp file is normal, but the presence of a hash in the filename might be significant. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. If this file is being used for something malicious, like storing data or being part of an attack, that could be a problem.\n\nNow, considering all the events: SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files in Office's SolutionPackages, which might be part of a legitimate add-in, but the use of hashes and multiple language-specific files could indicate something more. The HxTsr.exe process modifying the registry is another point of concern. Also, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is involved in creating these files might be part of a legitimate process, but the sheer number of files and their names could be suspicious.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these actions are normal for Office applications. For example, when you install an add-in, it might generate various files. The key is whether these activities are out of the ordinary for the user's environment. If this is a new user or a system that hasn't had these processes before, it could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple registry modifications by different processes (svchost, HxTsr) might indicate that there's some configuration changes happening. But without knowing what's being modified, it's hard to say. If the registry keys are related to security settings or system behavior, that could be a concern.\n\nIn summary, there are some suspicious elements like the numerous JS files created by SDXHelper.exe with hash names and the HxTsr.exe registry changes. However, without more context or additional indicators of compromise (like network activity, unexpected processes, or user behavior), it's hard to definitively say if this is malicious. But the combination of these events does warrant further investigation to rule out potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of potentially legitimate and suspicious activities, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Activity:** Multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `*.js`) with hashed filenames (e.g., `ar-sa-ui-strings-json_2a7e12e954408bbe573073625d7da1be.js`) are created in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`.\n   - **Legitimacy:** While `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with Microsoft Office (e.g., for add-ins), the repetitive creation of language-specific JS files with obfuscated names raises concerns. Legitimate Office add-ins typically do not generate such a high volume of files with hash-based names.\n\n2. **HxTsr.exe and Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Activity:** `HxTsr.exe` (non-standard process name) modifies the registry. This process is not a known Microsoft component and may indicate unauthorized configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Excel.EXE and DLL Loading:**\n   - **Activity:** Normal system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `amsi.dll`) are loaded by Excel. These are standard for .NET applications but do not indicate immediate threats.\n\n4. **Temporary File Creation:**\n   - **Activity:** Excel creates a temporary file (`1680A406.xlsx`) in a user-specific Temp directory. While common, the hash-based filename could hint at obfuscation or data exfiltration if linked to other suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Indicators:**\n- **Unusual File Patterns:** The use of hash-based filenames and language-specific strings (e.g., `af-za`, `am-et`) in `SDXHelper.exe` activities suggests potential obfuscation or automated file generation, which may align with malicious behavior (e.g., downloading payloads or evading detection).\n- **Non-Standard Processes:** `HxTsr.exe` is not a recognized Microsoft process. Its registry modifications could indicate unauthorized changes to system or user settings.\n- **Volume of Activity:** Repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` in a short timeframe may indicate automated processes, which could be benign (e.g., updates) or malicious (e.g., data collection).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Verify if the process is associated with a legitimate Office add-in or update.\n   - Check for digital signatures and file integrity (e.g., via `sigcheck` or antivirus tools).\n   - Monitor for network activity (e.g., HTTP\/HTTPS requests) from this process.\n\n2. **Analyze `HxTsr.exe`:**\n   - Identify the origin of the process (e.g., file path, publisher).\n   - Examine registry changes for signs of persistence (e.g., startup entries, key modifications).\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for unusual network traffic, user behavior, or system changes around the same timeframe.\n   - Look for additional processes or files with similar naming patterns (e.g., hashes, language codes).\n\n4. **User Context:**\n   - Determine if the user is a new account, has recently installed software, or is part of a high-risk group (e.g., remote workers).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities (e.g., Excel loading DLLs) are normal, the combination of **unusual file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** and the presence of **non-standard process `HxTsr.exe`** with registry modifications **warrants further investigation**. These could indicate either benign automation or potential threats (e.g., malware, spyware). Immediate action includes isolating the system for deeper analysis and reviewing endpoint protection logs."}

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let's start by scanning each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries about EXCEL.EXE creating file streams. The file paths are in the Temp directory, and they have Zone.Identifier streams. I remember that Zone.Identifier is used by Windows to mark files from different zones, like the internet, to trigger security warnings. But creating these streams might be normal when opening files from the internet. However, seeing multiple instances might be worth noting.\n\nThen there's an entry where EXCEL.EXE loads coml2.dll. That's a system file, so if it's being loaded normally, it's okay. But if there's any unusual activity here, like from a different path, that could be a red flag. But the path here is the standard System32 directory, so maybe that's normal.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe is creating several files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings. SDXHelper is part of Office, right? So creating these files might be part of normal Office operations, especially if they're related to localization or resources. But the repetition of some files might be a sign of something, but maybe not. Also, there's a file named \"fabric_...\" and \"bundle_...\", which could be part of Office's dependencies.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal during setup or updates. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which might be less common. However, if the user is manually configuring it, that's acceptable.\n\nLooking at the registry events, EXCEL.EXE and Explorer.EXE are setting registry values. Multiple registry changes from EXCEL could be part of normal operations, like saving settings. But if there's a lot of changes or changes to sensitive keys, that might be suspicious. However, the logs don't specify the keys, so it's hard to tell. Explorer.EXE setting a registry value might be normal too, like changing some user preferences.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events seem related to normal application behavior. EXCEL creating temporary files and registry entries, SDXHelper handling Office resources, and winlogbeat configuring itself. However, the repetition of certain files and the number of registry changes might be worth investigating further. But without more context or anomalies like unexpected processes or unusual file paths, it's probably just normal activity. I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity here. So maybe the answer is that it's not interesting for investigation, but I should check again for any overlooked details.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries primarily reflect normal operational activities of standard applications (e.g., Excel, SDXHelper, Explorer) and system processes. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Excel.EXE Activity**:\n   - **File Stream Creation**: Multiple entries show Excel.EXE creating `Zone.Identifier` streams in temporary directories. This is typical when files are opened from network\/internet locations, as Windows uses these streams to track security zones.\n   - **Registry Modifications**: Frequent \"Registry value set\" events from Excel.EXE are likely related to saving user preferences or application state, which is standard behavior.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.EXE File Creation**:\n   - Files in `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directories (e.g., `bundle_*.js`, `bundle_*.js`) are part of Office's localization\/resource management. Repetition of file names may indicate caching or incremental updates, which is normal.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat.EXE Configuration**:\n   - The creation of a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory by Winlogbeat (a log shipping tool) is consistent with configuration updates or manual setup, though the location is less typical for system tools.\n\n4. **Explorer.EXE Registry Changes**:\n   - A single \"Registry value set\" event from Explorer.EXE is likely related to user interface or shell settings, which is standard.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe events do not indicate malicious activity or anomalies. They align with expected behaviors of Office applications, system utilities, and log management tools. **No further investigation is warranted** based on this data alone.  \n\n**Answer**:  \n`{\"is_interesting\": false, \"reason\": \"All events correspond to normal application behavior (e.g., Excel file handling, Office resource management, Winlogbeat configuration). No suspicious activity detected.\"}`"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first 13 entries, they're all about EXCEL.EXE performing registry value set operations. That's a lot of the same process doing the same task. But registry changes can be normal, especially for applications like Excel. However, repeated changes might be suspicious if they're modifying critical keys or if there's a pattern. But on their own, without more context, they might not be a red flag.\n\nThen, starting from the 14th event, there's SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file paths look like they're part of Office add-ins or solutions. The filenames have hashes and JavaScript extensions, which might be legitimate resources. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files here could be normal during installation or updates. But I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nWait, the same SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files in different subdirectories. The paths include \"OfflineFiles\" which might be part of an add-in deployment. But is there any indication of malicious activity? The filenames have long hashes, which could be obfuscation. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created in different package directories might be normal, but maybe not. \n\nAnother thing is that the process names are EXCEL.EXE and SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper is part of Office, so it's a legitimate process. However, if these files are being created in unexpected locations or if there's a high volume, that could be a concern. But in this case, the files are in the expected Office directories. \n\nThe DNS query from EXCEL.EXE might be normal if it's accessing online resources. But without knowing the query details, it's hard to say. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes by Excel, which might be normal. SDXHelper creating several files in Office directories, which could be part of a legitimate add-in or update. However, the repetition and the number of files created might be worth investigating. But since all the processes involved are legitimate Office components, and the activities are within expected directories, it might not be malicious. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. If there's no obvious malicious activity, maybe it's just normal operations. However, the high number of registry changes and file creations could be indicative of something if they're part of a larger pattern. But without more context, like unexpected network activity, unusual processes, or known malicious hashes, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, if these events are part of a known good process, then they're not suspicious. But if SDXHelper is creating files that are not part of a known update or add-in, that could be a problem. Since the filenames have hashes, maybe they're legitimate resources. \n\nI think the key here is that the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. They involve legitimate processes performing normal operations. Therefore, maybe this isn't interesting for investigation unless there's more context. But the assistant might need to flag it as possibly normal but warranting further checks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves **legitimate Office-related processes** (EXCEL.EXE and SDXHelper.exe) performing **normal operational activities** within expected directories. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **EXCEL.EXE Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry Value Set` events by EXCEL.EXE are likely related to **application configuration or add-in management**. While repetitive, these actions are common for applications interacting with the registry during runtime or updates.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - SDXHelper.exe (a legitimate Office process) creates JavaScript files in **Office SolutionPackages directories** (e.g., `OfflineFiles`). These files appear to be **add-in resources** (e.g., `taskpane_*.js`, `ui-strings-json_*.js`), which are typical for Office add-ins or localized content. The filenames include **hashes**, which may be part of versioning or obfuscation but are not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **DNS Query:**\n   - A single `DNS Query` event by EXCEL.EXE is likely related to **online resource access** (e.g., cloud services, updates, or add-in dependencies). No malicious domains or IPs are indicated.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **No clear signs of malicious activity** (e.g., unexpected processes, unusual network traffic, or suspicious file content).\n- The activities align with **legitimate Office behavior** (e.g., add-in deployment, localization files, or configuration updates).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Not immediately interesting for investigation** unless there is **additional context** (e.g., known malicious hashes in the files, unexpected network activity, or user-reported anomalies). \n- However, **monitoring** for **unexpected changes** (e.g., unauthorized add-ins, unusual registry keys, or non-Office processes interacting with these directories) is advisable.\n\n**Recommendation:** If this is part of a larger dataset or if the user has reason to suspect compromise, further analysis (e.g., checking file hashes against malware databases, reviewing network traffic) would be prudent."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these log entries. So, the user provided a bunch of file creation events. The main process involved here is SDXHelper.exe, which is creating a lot of JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. These files seem to be UI string resources for different languages, like da-dk, fi-fi, etc. But wait, looking at the paths, they're all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That's a bit unusual because typically, those directories are used by Office for storing add-ins or solutions, but the files here are language-specific UI strings.\n\nNow, there's also an entry involving winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting and shipping logs, so that might be part of a monitoring setup. However, that's just one entry, and the rest are all from SDXHelper.exe.\n\nHmm, the key thing here is that SDXHelper.exe is generating these UI string files. If this is part of a legitimate Office add-in or solution, it might be normal. But if SDXHelper isn't a known or trusted application, this could be suspicious. Also, the fact that there are so many files being created in a short period might indicate some kind of malware activity, like droppers or installers that generate configuration files or payloads.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames include language codes, which might be part of localization. But why would SDXHelper be creating these? If the application is legitimate, it might be part of its normal operation. However, without knowing the context of SDXHelper.exe on this system, it's hard to say. If the user isn't aware of SDXHelper.exe being a legitimate part of their software, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, checking the process names: SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It might be part of a third-party application, but if it's not recognized, that's concerning. The presence of multiple file creations in the SolutionPackages folder could be part of an installer or updater, but again, without more context, it's hard to confirm.\n\nThe winlogbeat entry might be unrelated, but if the user is monitoring logs and this is part of their setup, that's normal. However, combining that with the SDXHelper activity, it's possible that the system is being monitored, but the SDXHelper activity is still suspicious.\n\nIn summary, the main concern here is the large number of files created by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard directory, which could indicate malicious activity. However, without more information about the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe and the context of the files, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the lack of obvious benign reasons for these files, it's leaning towards suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a series of **file creation events** primarily driven by the process **`SDXHelper.exe`**, with one unrelated entry from **`winlogbeat.exe`**. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **`SDXHelper.exe` Activity**:\n   - **Volume of Activity**: Over **15 files** are created in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...` under the `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` subdirectory.\n   - **File Names**: The files are named as language-specific UI string resources (e.g., `da-dk-ui-strings-json_...`, `fi-fi-ui-strings-json_...`), suggesting localization or configuration data.\n   - **Directory Context**: The `SolutionPackages` folder is typically used by **Microsoft Office** for storing add-ins or solutions. However, the creation of numerous `.js` files here is **unusual** and may indicate either:\n     - **Legitimate behavior** (e.g., a custom Office add-in generating localization files).\n     - **Suspicious activity** (e.g., malware masquerading as an add-in or installer).\n\n2. **`winlogbeat.exe` Activity**:\n   - A single entry shows the creation of a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory. **Winlogbeat** is a legitimate log shipping tool, so this is **likely benign** and part of a monitoring\/observability setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Unusual File Generation**:\n  - The large number of `.js` files generated by `SDXHelper.exe` in a non-standard directory (e.g., `SolutionPackages`) is **not typical** for legitimate software. This could indicate:\n    - **Malware** (e.g., a dropper or installer generating configuration files or payloads).\n    - **Untrusted Add-ins** (e.g., a malicious Office add-in exploiting the `SolutionPackages` directory).\n\n- **Lack of Context for `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is **not a known, trusted application** on the system, its activity raises **significant red flags**. Further investigation is needed to determine its legitimacy (e.g., checking digital signatures, file hashes, or network behavior).\n\n- **Persistence Risk**:\n  - The creation of multiple files in a centralized location could be a precursor to **malicious persistence** (e.g., injecting code into Office processes or configuring hooks).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe` Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **file signature** (via `sigcheck` or `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` in PowerShell).\n   - Search for the **file hash** in malware databases (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).\n   - Review the **installation source** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., was it downloaded from an untrusted website?).\n\n2. **Monitor `SolutionPackages` Directory**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** (ProcMon) or **Windows Defender ATP** to track file access and modifications in the `SolutionPackages` folder.\n\n3. **Investigate Network Behavior**:\n   - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` communicates with external IPs or domains (use **Wireshark**, **Microsoft Defender Firewall logs**, or **SIEM systems**).\n\n4. **Consider Isolation**:\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is untrusted, isolate the system or containerize the process to prevent potential damage.\n\n5. **Review `winlogbeat.exe` Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration (e.g., a log shipping setup) and not a red herring.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the `winlogbeat.exe` activity appears benign, the **`SDXHelper.exe` file generation** in the `SolutionPackages` directory is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The behavior is inconsistent with standard Office operations and could indicate **malware**, **unauthorized add-ins**, or **exploitation**. Further forensic analysis is critical to determine the intent behind these activities."}

The files have names like \"hu-hu-ui-strings-json\" and \"icon_built_in_svg_icon\" with various language codes. These seem like resource files, maybe part of a package or update. But why so many files being created? Also, some files are duplicated, like the icon files appearing twice. That might be a red flag if they're being created multiple times unnecessarily.\n\nThen there are events from EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes, and svchost.exe making registry changes. But those are common system processes. However, the repeated registry events from svchost might be normal, but I should check if they're related to any suspicious activity.\n\nNow, the main thing here is SDXHelper.exe creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages folder. That directory is typically used by Microsoft Office for add-ins or solutions. If this is part of a legitimate update or installation, it might be okay. But if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, or if these files are part of an unauthorized package, that could be a problem.

These files appear to be localization\/resource files for Office add-ins or solutions.\n   - **Duplicates**: Some files (e.g., `icon_built_in_svg_icon`) are created multiple times, which could indicate redundant operations or potential errors in the process.\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity**:\n   - **EXCEL.EXE** and **svchost.exe** perform standard registry operations and DNS queries, which are typical for legitimate system and application behavior.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Legitimacy**: The activities align with normal Office-related operations (e.g., installing or updating language packs, add-ins, or solutions). **SDXHelper.exe** is a known legitimate process, and the file paths match Microsoft Office's typical structure.\n- **No Malicious Indicators**: There is no evidence of suspicious network traffic, unexpected process behavior, or anomalies in the logs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs **do not indicate a security threat** or require immediate investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. The task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and no file information. There are 19 of these entries. Then, there are a few events from SDXHelper.exe where files are being created in specific directories under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. The files have names that look like they might be related to Office add-ins or packages, given the paths and the presence of \"PackageResources\" and \"OfflineFiles\".\n\nNow, the key here is to see if there's any suspicious activity. The repeated registry changes by EXCEL.EXE might be normal, but if they're all the same, maybe not. However, the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in those directories could be part of a legitimate Office solution deployment. But wait, the names of the files include things like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json\" and \"lv-lv-ui-strings-json\". These look like language-specific UI strings, which might be part of a localization package. However, the presence of multiple such files being created by SDXHelper.exe could be normal during installation or update processes.\n\nBut wait, why is SDXHelper.exe involved here? I know that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office add-ins or solutions, so creating files in SolutionPackages directories is expected. However, the fact that there are multiple file creations with different language codes might be part of a legitimate process. However, the lack of any other suspicious activity, like network connections or unexpected processes, makes me think this might be normal.\n\nBut then, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The main thing here is that there's a mix of registry events from Excel and file creations from SDXHelper. However, since all the events are related to Office processes and their normal operations, maybe there's nothing suspicious. Unless the number of registry changes is unusually high, but the logs don't indicate that. The justification would be that the events are related to legitimate Office activities, hence not interesting. But wait, the confidence might be lower because sometimes even legitimate processes can be part of an attack. However, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. So, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are part of normal Office operations, even though there are many registry changes. But I need to check if the registry changes by Excel are normal. Excel can modify the registry for various reasons, like add-ins or settings. If there are no other red flags, then it's not interesting. The confidence would be around 0.6, as there's a possibility of being normal, but the large number of registry events might be a bit concerning. However, given that the other events are from SDXHelper.exe which is a known process, it's probably safe to say not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events appears to be related to **legitimate Office-related processes**, and there is no clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **EXCEL.EXE Registry Modifications**:  \n   - The repeated \"Registry value set\" events from `EXCEL.EXE` are common during normal operations (e.g., add-in configuration, user settings, or macro execution). Without additional context (e.g., unusual registry keys, unexpected values, or correlation with other suspicious events), these are likely benign.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creations**:  \n   - The files created by `SDXHelper.exe` are located in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, a known directory for Office add-ins and solutions. The filenames (e.g., `transcription-strings.min.js`, `taskpane.js`) suggest they are part of **language-specific UI strings or Office add-in resources**, which aligns with normal deployment or update processes.\n\n3. **Lack of Red Flags**:  \n   - No network activity, unexpected processes, or anomalous behavior (e.g., file deletions, privilege escalation) is observed in the logs. The events are confined to registry and file operations typical of Office applications.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe events are consistent with **legitimate Office operations** (e.g., add-in deployment, localization, or configuration updates). Unless additional context (e.g., correlation with other suspicious logs, user reports, or threat intelligence) is available, there is no basis for further investigation.  \n\n**Classification**: **NOT INTERESTING**  \n**Confidence**: 0.65 (moderate, as the volume of registry events could raise questions in isolation, but the context of Office processes reduces suspicion)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are five entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each one is a file creation event under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files being created are all JavaScript files with names that seem to be language-specific, like mk-mk, ml-in, mr-in, and nb-no. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some Office add-in or a third-party tool? But the fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be suspicious. Typically, legitimate software might create temporary files, but creating multiple files with similar names in a specific location could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That seems like a place where Office might store some package resources, but the presence of a long, random-looking string in the directory name (36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b) makes me think this might be a unique identifier for a specific package. However, the repeated creation of files with different language codes could indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, possibly for some kind of localization or data extraction.\n\nBut wait, the same file name appears twice (mr-in-ui-strings-json_a2a3de2bd70bce8e2b5a87960994632c.js) in the list. That might be a duplicate entry, but maybe it's just a repetition in the log. However, if the process is creating the same file multiple times, that could be an issue. But the other entries are different, so maybe that's just a coincidence.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The key here is whether these events are indicative of malicious activity. The process name isn't a standard one, and the file creation in a non-standard location (especially under SolutionPackages) could be part of a malicious payload. However, without more context, like other events related to network activity, registry changes, or process execution, it's hard to be certain. But the fact that multiple files are being created by the same process in a specific directory might be worth investigating further. \n\nThe confidence level would be moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the unusual file creation patterns and the non-standard process name could be signs of something malicious. However, there's also a chance that this is a legitimate process, perhaps part of an Office add-in or a third-party application that's not well-known. \n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because the events show multiple file creations by a non-standard process in a location that's not typically used for such activities. The justification is that the repeated creation of JavaScript files in a SolutionPackages directory by SDXHelper.exe could indicate malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or injection. The confidence is around 0.65, as there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation but not enough to confirm malicious intent definitively.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard Office SolutionPackages directory, potentially indicating malicious activity such as data exfiltration or injection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
