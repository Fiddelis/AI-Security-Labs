So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell.exe loading DLLs. Some of them are standard system DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and clr.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal. But then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit odd because those are part of the antivirus, but maybe not a big red flag on their own.\n\nLooking further, there's a File Delete event where a temporary PowerShell script is deleted. That could be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers delete their own files to avoid detection. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's a ProcessCreate event with a command line that includes \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Wait, that command line seems suspicious. The parameter \"-unidade_auxiliar\" doesn't look right. It might be a typo or a malicious attempt to map a network drive, possibly to access another system's C$ share. That's a common technique in attacks to access remote systems. Also, the presence of \"Target\" in the path might indicate a target system, which is a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated ImageLoad events for PowerShell. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, excessive loading of DLLs or unusual paths might indicate something's wrong. But in this case, the paths are mostly system-related, except for the Defender DLLs. However, the command line in the ProcessCreate event stands out as a potential indicator of compromise.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The FileCreate events for temporary files are common, but the combination with the network drive mapping command makes me think this might be part of a larger attack. The user might be trying to map a network share to access files on another machine, which is a common attack vector.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the presence of the suspicious command line in the ProcessCreate event is a strong indicator. Even though some other events are normal, that one command line suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe ImageLoad events for system DLLs and Windows Defender components, combined with a suspicious ProcessCreate event containing a command line that attempts to map a network drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$ (likely a lateral movement attempt). The use of '-unidade_auxiliar' (possibly a typo\/malicious parameter) raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one shows a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That seems a bit suspicious because that's a common place for malicious scripts to be stored. Then there are multiple entries with the same command line using powershell.exe to download a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is from a repo named WinPwn, which I recognize as a known malicious repository. The command uses iex and WebClient to download and execute the script, which is a classic PowerShell attack technique.\n\nNext, there are several instances of New-PSDrive commands mapping a network drive to a target's C$ share. That's often used in lateral movement or to access files on remote systems. Then there are multiple events with the task 'Execute a Remote Command', which could indicate someone is trying to run commands on a remote machine, possibly part of a broader attack.\n\nHowever, some entries have \"None\" for process or file, which might be incomplete logs or not relevant. But the repeated PowerShell commands downloading from a known bad repo and the network drive mappings are red flags. Even though some events don't have detailed info, the combination of these suspicious activities makes this batch worth investigating. The confidence is high because the malicious GitHub repo and the command patterns are clear indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell executing malicious script downloads from a known bad GitHub repository (WinPwn) and creating network drive mappings to remote systems, indicating potential lateral movement and execution of malicious code.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
