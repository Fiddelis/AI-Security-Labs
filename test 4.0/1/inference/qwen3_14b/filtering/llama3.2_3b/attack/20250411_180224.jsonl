The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called cmd.exe with a command line that includes schtasks \/create. The command is setting up a scheduled task with the system user, running daily, and the trigger is a PowerShell script. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide the script by naming it something that sounds non-existent? Also, using -ep bypass in PowerShell is a common technique to bypass execution policies, which is often used in attacks.\n\nNext, there's another event with schtasks.exe creating a task again, this time with a different script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the same pattern of a non-existing script name. The task is named win32times, which might be a misleading name to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are events about ImageLoad for schtasks.exe, which is normal since it's a legitimate Windows tool. But the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with suspicious scripts is concerning. The use of the system account with the \/ru system parameter means the task runs with high privileges, which is risky if it's executing arbitrary scripts.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files or modifying the registry. However, the chrome events don't seem suspicious on their own. The winlogbeat file creation might be part of normal operations, but the PowerShell scripts being scheduled are more worrying.\n\nThe presence of multiple scheduled tasks created with PowerShell scripts that don't exist (as indicated by the filenames) suggests that this could be a setup for a potential attack. The attacker might be trying to execute malicious code under the guise of a scheduled task. Even though the scripts aren't found here, the act of creating such tasks is suspicious, especially with the use of bypassing execution policies.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The command_line in the first event includes both schtasks \/create and \/query, which might be a way to check if the task was created successfully. The repeated attempts to create tasks might indicate that the attacker is ensuring persistence.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows suspicious activity related to creating scheduled tasks with potentially malicious scripts. Even though some events are normal (like image loads), the combination of creating tasks with non-existent scripts and using PowerShell with bypass flags points towards a possible security threat. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled task creations with PowerShell scripts using '-ep bypass' (bypass execution policy) and non-existent script filenames (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), indicating potential malicious activity. Tasks are configured to run as 'system' with daily recurrence, suggesting privilege escalation and persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
