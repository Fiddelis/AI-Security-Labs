{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is the presence of several processes that are typically legitimate, like svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. However, there are some suspicious commands being executed.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe processes, there's a command line that adds a user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to the domain and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag because creating domain admin accounts is a significant action and shouldn't be done without authorization. The passwords here look like temporary ones, which might be part of an attack where the attacker is setting up access.\n\nAnother cmd.exe process uses \"net1.exe\" and \"net.exe\" to add users and groups. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of the standard \"net.exe\" could be a typo or a malicious replacement. The commands are modifying domain admin groups, which is a high-privilege action. \n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being executed, which could be part of a script or a series of commands trying to escalate privileges or establish persistence. The fact that these commands are being run in the context of domain admin groups suggests a potential compromise of administrative credentials.\n\nThe file creation events involve SRUtmp.log and a .yml.new file from winlogbeat. While the latter might be part of a legitimate configuration change, the former is a temporary log file that's normal for some system processes. However, combined with the other events, it might indicate that the system is under investigation or being monitored, which could be part of an attack lifecycle.\n\nOverall, the combination of unauthorized user creation, modification of domain admin groups, and the use of command-line tools to perform these actions points towards a potential security incident. The confidence level is high because these actions are indicative of malicious activity, even though some processes are legitimate. The key indicators here are the unauthorized changes to domain admin groups and the use of temporary passwords, which are common in attack scenarios.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts with temporary passwords, use of 'net1.exe' (likely a typo\/malicious replacement for 'net.exe'), and repeated process access attempts. These actions suggest potential privilege escalation or account compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
