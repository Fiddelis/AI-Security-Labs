The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's a process creation of cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a service called win32times, pointing to a PowerShell script. The command line uses sc create, which is used to create services. The path mentioned is c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. The name seems a bit suspicious because it has \"NonExistingScript.ps1,\" which might be a red flag. Also, creating a service that runs a PowerShell script could be part of a malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there's a process access event for powershell.exe. Not sure yet, but maybe related. Then another sc.exe process creating the same service again, but with a different script path: c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is odd. Maybe the attacker is trying to create a service that runs a script that doesn't exist, which could be a way to hide the actual malicious activity or maybe a typo. But why would they create a service pointing to a non-existent file? That might be an error, but in the context of an attack, it could be a way to obfuscate the real payload.\n\nThen there are events related to services.exe modifying the registry. Changing registry values could be part of configuring the service or altering system settings. The sc qc win32times command checks the service configuration, which is normal, but if done in a suspicious context, it might be part of an attack.\n\nThe next events involve image loads for calc.exe and Calculator.exe, both loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL. However, the presence of both calc.exe and Calculator.exe (note the capitalization difference) might be a red flag. Maybe a typo or a different process, but not sure yet. However, if these are legitimate processes, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a new configuration file might be normal if someone is setting up monitoring, but it's worth noting. The other events involve chrome.exe with registry changes and image loading amsi.dll, which is part of Windows' anti-malware feature. If amsi.dll is being loaded, that's normal, but if there's an attempt to disable it, that would be suspicious. However, in these events, it's just being loaded, so maybe not.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the use of sc.exe to create services pointing to non-existent PowerShell scripts. This could be an attempt to set up persistence, but if the scripts don't exist, maybe the attacker intended to use a different method or there's a mistake. However, in a real attack scenario, creating services with such commands is often seen in malware to maintain access. The combination of multiple service creation attempts and registry modifications might indicate an attempt to compromise the system. The other events like image loads and file creation don't seem as suspicious on their own, but when combined with the service creation, it adds up.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit moderate. There are some suspicious activities, but not all events are clearly malicious. The presence of \"NonExistingScript\" is a clue, but without more context, it's hard to be 100% certain. However, the overall pattern of creating services with potentially malicious scripts and modifying the registry is enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of a Windows service (win32times) with a command line pointing to a non-existent PowerShell script, which may indicate obfuscation or persistence attempts. 2) Repeated use of 'sc.exe' to create services with similar suspicious paths. 3) Registry modifications by services.exe, which could indicate configuration changes or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
