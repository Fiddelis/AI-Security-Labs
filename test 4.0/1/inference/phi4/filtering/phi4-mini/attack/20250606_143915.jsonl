This pattern could indicate malicious activity such as persistence or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Process Name Consistency**: The process `svchost.exe` is legitimate but often mimicked by malware to blend in. It's a system process that hosts services, making it a common choice for malicious actors.\n\n2. **High Frequency of Events**: A large number of events (25) all involving the same action (`Registry object added or deleted`) and the same process suggests abnormal behavior.\n\n3. **Lack of File Involvement**: No file operations are logged alongside these registry changes, which is atypical for legitimate system processes like `svchost.exe`.\n\n4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**: The consistent pattern of registry modifications without additional context or file activity raises suspicion of a potential compromise.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: Given the unusual nature and volume of these events, there is high confidence in classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING,\" warranting further investigation to rule out malicious behavior."}
