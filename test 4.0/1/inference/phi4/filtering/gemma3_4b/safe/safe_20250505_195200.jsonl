Such repetitive patterns could suggest automated or scripted actions, which may not be typical for legitimate software operations.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is a known helper process associated with Microsoft Office solutions, often used for updates or installations. However, if it's involved in creating multiple files unexpectedly, especially with content that seems similar yet different (e.g., only hash changes), it can raise concerns about potential misuse or compromise.\n\n3. **Potential Indicators of Compromise**: The creation of multiple files within a short timeframe in the same directory, combined with variations in file hashes while keeping filenames nearly identical, could be indicative of an attempt to inject malicious scripts or payloads into trusted application directories.\n\n4. **Investigation Merit**: These patterns merit further investigation to determine if these actions are benign (e.g., a legitimate update process) or malicious (such as an intrusion or malware activity). This warrants marking the event batch as \"INTERESTING\" for deeper analysis. \n\nThe confidence level is high but not absolute due to possible benign explanations, such as rapid updates with multiple file versions being installed during deployment of new features or patches in Office applications."}
