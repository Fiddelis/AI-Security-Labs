While it is normal for Discord to make network connections, the frequency and context (especially if combined with other suspicious activities) can be a red flag.\n\n2. **File Creation Time Changes**: Several events show changes in file creation times under the `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\discord` directory. This might indicate tampering or an attempt to hide traces of activity, which is often seen in malicious software operations.\n\n3. **Process Accesses**: Repeated `Process accessed` events for `Discord.exe` could suggest attempts at privilege escalation or unauthorized access to system resources.\n\n4. **Image Load Events**: The loading of various node modules and libraries (like `vulkan-1.dll`) by `Discord.exe` is typical, but if these are not part of the legitimate Discord installation, they might be indicative of code injection or malicious extensions.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: The combination of these factors provides a moderately high confidence that this batch warrants further investigation for potential security issues."}
