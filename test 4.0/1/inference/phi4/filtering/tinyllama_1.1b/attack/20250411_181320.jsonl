The process was used for various operations such as setting registry values, creating and deleting files in sensitive locations like the Temp directory, loading images that may relate to malware or bypassing security measures (e.g., Windows Defender components), and executing commands that suggest reconnaissance activities on the file system (ls, get-childitem, gci). These actions, especially when combined with attempts to alter registry settings and manipulate files in user directories, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
