There are multiple instances where a legitimate executable (`calc.exe`) is encoded to a temporary file and later decoded into another executable, indicating potential malicious activity. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications via processes like `cmd.exe`, `certutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` which can be indicative of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
