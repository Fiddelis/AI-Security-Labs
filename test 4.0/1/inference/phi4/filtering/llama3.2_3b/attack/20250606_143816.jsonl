The absence of detailed context like originating process identifiers or file paths across all events raises suspicion of potential malicious activity, such as command-and-control operations, especially when occurring frequently without any additional logging data to provide transparency or legitimacy. This pattern warrants further investigation into the source of these commands and their intended purpose. The confidence score reflects a high likelihood that this behavior is noteworthy but acknowledges that confirmation requires deeper analysis beyond the provided log information."}
