The frequent setting of registry values by chrome.exe and the loading of specific system DLLs (amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll) could indicate tampering or malicious activity. Furthermore, the creation of files via powershell and winlogbeat suggests potential lateral movement or data exfiltration activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
