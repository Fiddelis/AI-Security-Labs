The presence of 'RuntimeBroker.exe' involved in a registry event is unusual, as it typically does not interact with the registry directly. Additionally, there are repeated file creation events by 'winlogbeat.exe' at the same path, indicating possible suspicious activity or misconfiguration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
