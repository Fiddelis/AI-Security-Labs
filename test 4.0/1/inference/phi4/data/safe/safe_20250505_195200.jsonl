The repeated creation of files at specific paths, especially with identical file names appearing multiple times in quick succession, suggests a pattern that could be indicative of an automated process or script.\n\nKey points for consideration:\n\n1. **Process Name - SDXHelper.exe**: While not inherently malicious on its own, SDXHelper.exe can be used by legitimate processes like Microsoft Office's features (e.g., AI-powered Copilot) but can also potentially be exploited by malware to perform similar tasks of file creation or manipulation.\n\n2. **File Paths and Patterns**: The files are being created in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory, which is a common location for Microsoft Office-related data and updates. However, the repetition of identical file paths suggests more than usual software behavior, potentially indicating automated installation or update processes that could be benign (e.g., repetitive package updates) or malicious (e.g., malware deploying payloads).\n\n3. **Repetitive Behavior**: The presence of multiple logs with duplicate file creation paths is unusual for typical user-driven activities and raises suspicion. It might imply an attempt to overwrite files, deploy a payload, or create decoys.\n\nGiven these observations, the pattern warrants further investigation into whether `SDXHelper.exe` is executing legitimate updates or if it's potentially being leveraged for malicious purposes. The classification as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level of 0.8 reflects this need for deeper analysis to confirm benign versus malicious activity."}
