Triggered rule \"ProcessCreate\".\n   - `powershell.exe` with command line: `\"powershell.exe\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`. Triggered rule \"ProcessCreate\".\n\n2. **Registry Events:**\n   - `sppsvc.exe`: Triggered rule \"RegistryEvent\" for a registry value set.\n   - `svchost.exe`: Triggered rule \"RegistryEvent\" for a registry value set.\n   - `powershell.exe`: Triggered rule \"RegistryEvent\" for a registry value set.\n\n3. **Process Access:**\n   - `powershell.exe` was accessed multiple times. Each access triggered the rule \"ProcessAccess\".\n\n4. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Several DLL files were loaded by `powershell.exe`, triggering the rule \"ImageLoad\". These include:\n     - `taskschd.dll`\n     - `mscoree.dll`\n     - `mscoreei.dll`\n     - `clr.dll`\n     - `mscorlib.ni.dll`\n     - `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`\n     - `MpOAV.dll`\n\n5. **File Events:**\n   - A file was created by `powershell.exe`: Path is `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`. Triggered rule \"FileCreate\".\n   - The same file was then deleted. Triggered rule \"FileDeleteDetected\".\n\n### Observations\n\n- **Potential Security Concerns:**\n  - Multiple actions were performed by `powershell.exe`, including process creation, registry modifications, and file manipulations.\n  - The deletion of a PowerShell script from the Temp directory might indicate an attempt to clean up traces.\n\n- **Patterns:**\n  - Frequent access and manipulation of files and processes related to `powershell.exe` suggest potential automation or scripting activity.\n  - Registry value changes could be indicative of configuration adjustments or persistence mechanisms.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Investigate the purpose and origin of the PowerShell script created in the Temp directory.\n- Monitor for further suspicious activities involving `powershell.exe`.\n- Consider implementing stricter controls on registry modifications and file deletions by processes.\n- Review security policies to detect and mitigate unauthorized process creation and access attempts. \n\nThis structured analysis helps in understanding the sequence of events, potential threats, and areas that require closer scrutiny or intervention."}
