{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log entries appear to be from a Windows system security audit or monitoring tool, detailing various process activities and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). Below is an analysis based on the contents:\n\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Execution**:\n   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` running scripts downloaded from a URL hosted on GitHub (`https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn`). This pattern suggests potential malicious activity, as adversaries often use PowerShell to download and execute scripts that perform unauthorized actions.\n\n2. **Script Execution**:\n   - The specific script being executed is `WinPwn.ps1`. This script might be intended for reconnaissance or exploitation based on its name and the fact it's downloaded from an external source. The script invocation includes parameters like `-noninteractive` and `-consoleoutput`, suggesting automation and suppression of user interface elements to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Indicators of Compromise**:\n   - The consistent use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` for executing the downloaded script is a red flag, as it indicates dynamic execution of code fetched from an external source.\n   - The repeated downloads and executions might indicate persistence mechanisms or attempts to escalate privileges.\n\n4. **Other Processes**:\n   - There are mentions of `wusa.exe`, which is used by Windows Update to apply updates silently in the background. This process alone isn't suspicious, but its presence amidst potentially malicious PowerShell activity warrants attention.\n   - A mention of a process named \"TCCmd.exe\" with parameters relating to service creation or deletion indicates potential misuse for creating backdoors or altering system configurations.\n\n5. **User Account Management**:\n   - Logs include entries related to \"User Account Management,\" which could indicate attempts to create, modify, or delete user accounts, possibly as part of a privilege escalation effort or to maintain persistence.\n\n6. **Task Lifecycle Events**:\n   - The logs reference various lifecycle events such as \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle.\" These might be specific to the monitoring tool used, indicating when certain components started or stopped running.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Investigate PowerShell Activity**: Review detailed logs of all PowerShell executions to understand what actions are being performed by the scripts.\n  \n- **Block Malicious URLs**: Implement network controls to block access to known malicious domains (e.g., the GitHub URL mentioned).\n\n- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Use an EDR solution to gather more context on suspicious processes and their behaviors.\n\n- **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches, particularly those related to PowerShell vulnerabilities.\n\n- **User Account Review**: Verify user account creation\/modification logs for unauthorized changes.\n\n- **Audit and Harden Systems**: Regularly audit system configurations and apply the principle of least privilege to minimize potential damage from compromised accounts or processes. \n\nBy taking these steps, you can mitigate risks associated with potentially malicious activities indicated by the log entries."}
