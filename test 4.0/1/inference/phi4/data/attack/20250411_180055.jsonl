There are frequent registry value changes by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, which can indicate persistence or privilege escalation attempts. Additionally, the presence of process access events for PowerShell could suggest misuse or an attempt to bypass defenses. Multiple file creations related to winlogbeat.exe may be benign but warrant further investigation if unexpected in context. The repeated registry changes by chrome.exe without corresponding files also raise concerns about possible malicious extensions or scripts.
