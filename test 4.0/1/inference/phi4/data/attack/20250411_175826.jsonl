Additionally, there are several registry value modifications and suspicious file creations involving executables like 'svchost.exe', 'powershell.exe', and new installations like 'winlogbeat'. These patterns collectively suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' performing registry modifications and file creations, alongside repeated registry changes by 'chrome.exe', raise suspicion. Additionally, unusual activity like image loading with potential security relevance (e.g., amsi.dll) further indicates possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Frequent Registry Modifications:**\n   - `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`, and multiple instances of `chrome.exe` are modifying registry values. While some of these processes may legitimately alter registry settings, the sheer frequency associated with `chrome.exe` is unusual.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - `powershell.exe` has been involved in both registry modifications and file creations. PowerShell scripts can be used for legitimate administrative tasks but also for executing malicious commands if compromised or abused by attackers.\n\n3. **Suspicious File Creations:**\n   - The creation of files via `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` (e.g., `unidade_logico.txt`) could indicate data exfiltration or the deployment of additional tools\/malware payloads, which warrants further scrutiny.\n\n4. **Image Loading Activity:**\n   - Image loading events by `chrome.exe` involving security-related DLLs such as `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` may suggest attempts to tamper with or disable antivirus defenses, a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\n5. **Overall Context:**\n   - The combination of these activities, particularly the use of well-known tools like PowerShell for suspicious modifications and file operations, increases the likelihood that this batch warrants further investigation into potential malicious behavior.\n\nGiven these observations, the classification as \"INTERESTING\" is justified with a high confidence level due to the convergence of multiple indicators typically associated with malicious activity."}
