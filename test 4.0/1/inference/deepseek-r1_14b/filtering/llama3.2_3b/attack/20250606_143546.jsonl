{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The first event shows powershell.exe accessing something, then creating a process. That's a bit suspicious because attackers might use this to execute malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line in one of the events that includes importing a PowerShell script from a path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. The file paths look complex and maybe obfuscated with escaped characters (like \\\\). This could indicate an attempt to hide where the script is coming from, which is a red flag for malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events showing powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll and others related to .NET. While PowerShell does need these for operation, the volume here might be unusual unless it's running complex scripts or multiple modules.\n\nOther processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe also have registry access and file creation activities. Svchost is a common system process, but seeing FileCreate events could indicate it's writing new files, which needs context. However, without more info on what those files are, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nConsidering all these together—suspicious command lines in PowerShell, multiple registry and file operations, and the potential obfuscation—it seems like there might be some malicious activity happening. The combination of events makes me think this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and file operations, including potential script execution from an unusual path.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are coming from svchost.exe. That's a common system process, so it's not inherently suspicious on its own. But looking at the tasks, there are several FileCreate events in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That part of the Windows directory is typically used for updates and patches. So creating files here could be normal during an update process.\n\nThen, I see that msedgewebview2.exe is loading BitsProxy.dll. That seems a bit unusual because Edge WebView processes might not usually interact with BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service). But maybe it's part of some legitimate download or update mechanism, so I'm not sure if that's red flag yet.\n\nAnother point is the MpSigStub.exe process, which is related to Windows Defender. It's creating several files in the Temp directory. While this could be normal for signature updates or other processes, the number and naming of these files might warrant a closer look. The file paths are pretty long and include GUIDs, which isn't uncommon but combined with multiple creates from the same process could indicate something.\n\nThere's also setup.exe creating files in the EdgeCore directory. That sounds like it could be part of an installation or update process for Edge itself. But why would setup.exe create these specific files? It might be trying to replace or update existing components, which is normal during software updates but could also be indicative of malicious activity if those files are not legitimate.\n\nLooking at the Registry events from svchost.exe, those can be tricky because they're so common. Malware often uses registry keys for persistence, but without knowing what exactly was changed, it's hard to say. It might just be part of a system update or some service configuration change.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple similar events from the same processes creating files in the same directories. This repetition could be a sign of自动化行为 or scripting, which is more common in malicious activities like ransomware or other attacks. But it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nConsidering all these points together, I think there might be some cause for concern. The combination of svchost.exe activity in update directories, Edge-related processes accessing unusual files, and the multiple file creations from MpSigStub.exe could indicate something more than just normal system operations. However, each individual event doesn't cross any clear red flags without context.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards this batch being potentially suspicious but not definitely malicious. It's worth investigating further, especially looking into the exact files created and registry changes made to ensure they're part of legitimate updates or processes.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits characteristics that could indicate potential malicious activity, though it is not conclusive without further investigation. Key points include:\n\n1. **svchost.exe Activity:** Multiple FileCreate events in the SoftwareDistribution directory, which is typically used for system updates but may warrant scrutiny if unusual files are present.\n\n2. **msedgewebview2.exe and BitsProxy.dll Interaction:** Unusual interaction that could be part of legitimate processes or potentially malicious activity.\n\n3. **MpSigStub.exe and Temp Directory Files:** Creation of multiple files with GUIDs in the Temp directory, which might indicate normal operations but could also signal malicious behavior.\n\n4. **setup.exe Activity:** Creating files in the EdgeCore directory, which may be part of a legitimate update process but could also be suspicious if the files are unexpected.\n\n5. **Registry Events from svchost.exe:** Common events that alone are not concerning but, combined with other indicators, merit attention.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile each event individually might not raise red flags, the cumulative behavior suggests potential suspicion. Further investigation is recommended to verify the legitimacy of the activities, particularly focusing on the exact files created and any registry changes made. This will help determine if it's a legitimate system operation or indicative of malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm looking at each JSON object and trying to see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: MsMpEng.exe loading mpengine.dll. That sounds normal because it's Windows Defender-related. Next, setup.exe creating a file in the EdgeCore directory—also seems routine for installing software.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed without any arguments. It's a common tool to check user information, but sometimes attackers use it to gather info. But on its own, it's not suspicious yet.\n\nPowershell.exe is next. I see several entries where it's accessed and loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are normal for Powershell as it uses .NET components. However, there's a command line in one event that stands out: creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe. That might be concerning because creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, I see file deletions and pipe creations by Powershell. The deletion is logged as detected, which could mean the system flagged it. Also, there are remote command executions from paths like C:\\unidade_logico..., which seems a bit arbitrary and possibly malicious.\n\nThe last few events show Powershell executing scripts from \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script imports modules and tries to run Invoke-entrada_principal with some error handling. The use of -OutputDirectory in the temp directory is another red flag because attackers often drop files there.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of Powershell with unusual commands and file operations suggests potential malicious activity. The creation of a new service and attempts to execute scripts from non-standard paths are indicators that this batch might be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs indicate suspicious activities including the creation of a new service via PowerShell, file deletions, remote command executions, and attempts to load potentially malicious scripts from unusual paths. These actions are indicative of possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are multiple entries here, each as a JSON object on separate lines. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first few events have a \"process\" field with a command line that runs powershell.exe. The script being executed imports a module from a specific path and tries to invoke a function called Invoke-entrada_principal. It also includes error handling and a sleep command. This looks like some PowerShell scripting, possibly part of a larger script or tool.\n\nNext, I notice there are several events where the same PowerShell command is run multiple times. That repetition might indicate something automated or part of a script execution. Then, there's an event where a new service is being created using New-Service and Start-Service commands in PowerShell. This could be installing a service on the system, which might be legitimate but also suspicious if it's not expected.\n\nLooking further down, some events have \"winlog\" with tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". These seem related to Windows event logging infrastructure, perhaps indicating that services related to event logs are starting or stopping. But these alone don't seem too concerning unless they're happening unusually frequently.\n\nThen there's a change in the \"process\" field: some events have \"None\", meaning no process was captured for those events. Instead, the \"winlog\" task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path points to the same PowerShell script as before. This suggests that the system executed a remote command, possibly invoking the script from another location.\n\nNow, considering all these together: there's repeated execution of a PowerShell script, attempts to create services, and remote command executions pointing to the same script. The script is located at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Unusual file paths with spaces and non-English characters might be red flags, especially if they're not common on the system.\n\nMoreover, the combination of creating services and executing scripts could indicate potential persistence mechanisms. Attackers often use such techniques to maintain access to a compromised system. The repeated attempts and different log entries (process creation, service creation, remote command execution) across multiple events suggest a coordinated set of activities that might be malicious.\n\nI should also check if the script is known for any malicious purposes. While I can't look it up right now, the behavior observed—installing services and executing scripts remotely—is commonly seen in malware campaigns. The use of error handling (try-catch) in the PowerShell script might be to avoid detection or clean up after an attack.\n\nThe fact that multiple events are linked to the same file and similar commands strengthens the case for investigation. It's possible that this activity is part of a larger campaign attempting unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows several red flags: repeated script execution, service creation, remote command usage, and unusual file paths. These collectively indicate potentially malicious behavior that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated PowerShell script execution attempts, service creations, and remote command executions pointing to the same script, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"High\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. The majority are repeated instances where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path points to the same PowerShell script. There's one event with a process named \"services.exe\" and a logon task, but that's just one out of many. Since so many events are similar, it might indicate either legitimate repeated activity or possible malicious behavior like scripting execution across multiple sessions. I'm leaning towards interesting because of the high repetition and specific file path.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events show remote command execution targeting the same PowerShell script, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given batch of system log events is interesting for investigation or not. Let me look at each event carefully.\n\nAll these events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each JSON object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nStarting with the first few events, I see that the 'process' field is \"None\", which might mean there's no associated process information. The 'winlog' field contains a task description. Most of them have \"Execute a Remote Command\" as the task. There are also some entries where the task is \"Windows Update Agent\". \n\nThe 'file' field in most events points to a specific path: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This seems like a PowerShell script file, which could be suspicious because scripts can execute arbitrary code. The fact that the same file is referenced multiple times might indicate repeated attempts or execution of this script.\n\nI notice that there are 14 events where 'task' is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and one event where it's \"Windows Update Agent\". The Windows Update Agent task is usually legitimate, handling updates, so that might not be as concerning. However, the consistent occurrence of the same remote command execution across multiple entries could indicate malicious activity, such as repeated attempts to execute potentially harmful scripts.\n\nThe repetition of the exact same file path in multiple events raises a red flag. Malicious actors often use similar commands or file paths during an attack to establish persistence or spread malware. Additionally, if this script is being executed by some remote command, it could be part of a larger attack vector, such as a remote exploit or a command-and-control communication.\n\nI also consider the possibility of this being a false positive. Maybe legitimate scripts are being run repeatedly for updates or other benign purposes. However, given that all events involve remote commands and the same file path, it's more likely to be suspicious, especially if these events occurred in quick succession or under unusual circumstances.\n\nMoreover, since each event is identical except for one variation with \"Windows Update Agent\", there might be a pattern of attempts where sometimes it's disguised as update activity. This could be an attempt to bypass detection by alternating between different task descriptions while performing malicious actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of repeated remote command executions targeting the same script file makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The consistency and volume suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants attention.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a remote command targeting the same PowerShell script, indicating possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
