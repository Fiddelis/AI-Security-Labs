{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the first event shows cmd.exe being used with a command line that creates a service called win32times. The command runs \"cmd \/c start\" and points to a .ps1 script in C:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. Since the path ends with .ps1, it's a PowerShell script. But since the script doesn't exist (NonExistingScript), this could be an attempt to execute a non-existent file, possibly malicious.\n\nThe second event is powershell.exe being accessed. That's normal if someone is using PowerShell, but combined with other events involving cmd and creating services, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThird event shows sc.exe used to create another service, win32times, pointing to a different .ps1 script in C:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the file doesn't exist, which raises flags.\n\nNext two events involve services.exe setting registry values. Services.exe is legitimate for managing system services, but multiple writes might be part of an attack.\n\nThe sixth event is sc.exe checking a service (qc win32times). This is normal administrative activity, so maybe not too concerning on its own.\n\nSeventh and eighth events show calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. While this is normal for these processes, the repeated use might indicate something unusual, especially if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNinth event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is legitimate for log management, so probably not an issue unless there's more context.\n\nTenth event shows powershell.exe again setting registry values, which could be part of script execution or configuration changes, but in combination with other events, it might be suspicious.\n\nThe last few events involve chrome.exe accessing registry and creating pipes. While Chrome does interact with these areas for functionality, multiple registry writes and pipe creations without a clear reason could indicate malicious activity, especially when combined with the earlier cmd and PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several attempts to create services using non-existent scripts, which is a red flag for potential malware installation or persistence mechanisms. The use of both cmd.exe and powershell.exe along with multiple registry modifications by services.exe adds to the suspicion. Additionally, the repeated urlmon.dll loads might be part of malicious code trying to execute.\n\nI'm confident at about 0.85 that this batch shows signs of malicious activity. The combination of creating non-existent scripts as services, multiple registry writes, and unusual file operations points towards potential attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes attempts to execute non-existent PowerShell scripts via cmd.exe and sc.exe, indicating potential malicious activity. Multiple registry modifications by services.exe and repeated urlmon.dll loads in calc.exe are suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
