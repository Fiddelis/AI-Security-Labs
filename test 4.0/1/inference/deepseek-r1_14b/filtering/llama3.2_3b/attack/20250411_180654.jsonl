{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, the majority of these logs are related to powershell.exe processes. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously, so that's a red flag. Notably, several events show powershell.exe accessing files with .ps1 extensions, which are script files. This could indicate they're executing scripts.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines, some have paths like \"C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\estrutura_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". The filename suggests it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic for keyloggers used in malware. This makes me suspicious of potential malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was deleted: \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\" for the path \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1\". Script policy files are often related to PowerShell execution policies, and deleting them might be an attempt to bypass restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where a remote command was executed. This is concerning because it suggests unauthorized access or control over the system.\n\nOn the other hand, some events seem benign, like file creations by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe for legitimate processes. However, these don't outweigh the malicious signs from powershell.exe activities.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing scripts, deletion of a script policy file, execution of remote commands—it's highly likely that this batch is indicative of malicious behavior. Therefore, it's definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing and executing scripts from various paths, including attempts to delete script policy files and execute remote commands, suggest potential malicious activity such as keylogging or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst event:\n- Process: winlogbeat.exe\n- Task: File created (specifically .winlogbeat.yml.new)\nI know that winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for collecting and forwarding log data, often part of the Elastic Stack. It's common for such tools to create or update configuration files. So this event by itself doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nSecond event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Task: File created (entrada_padrao.txt)\nPowershell is a powerful tool that can be used both benignly and maliciously. However, just creating a file isn't inherently suspicious. It's a common action for scripts or manual tasks. Without additional context like unusual paths or permissions changes, this event alone doesn't indicate malicious activity.\n\nCombined analysis:\nLooking at both events together, they involve legitimate processes (winlogbeat and powershell) performing standard file creation activities. There's no evidence of irregular patterns, such as multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or inconsistencies with user behavior. The files created are in typical locations for their respective tools, and the actions don't suggest any deviation from normal operations.\n\nI'm confident that this batch doesn't indicate malicious behavior. Therefore, it's not interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate processes (winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe) performing standard file creation tasks in typical locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
