Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. It seems like PowerShell is accessing various files and registry values. Specifically, I notice that it's loading different DLLs and creating a file in the Temp directory. The filename looks suspicious: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1. That might be a temporary script file created by PowerShell. Sometimes, malicious scripts are dropped here.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe is setting a registry value and creating files related to Windows Defender's Platform directory. This could be part of normal operations, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking further down, I see svchost.exe accessing various DLLs like urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. Svchost is known for running legitimate system services, but sometimes it can be used by malware to hide processes. The file paths seem a bit off, especially the ones in the SoftwareDistribution directory. Those could indicate something malicious trying to update or drop files.\n\nAlso, there's an event from RuntimeBroker.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for URL handling. Not too concerning on its own, but combined with other events might be worth looking into.\n\nI also notice that msedgewebview2.exe loaded BitsProxy.dll, which I think is related to the Edge browser's web view component. That seems normal unless there's something else going on.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated actions from powershell.exe creating temp files and accessing various system components could be signs of malicious activity. The svchost.exe events might indicate that some service or process is trying to modify system settings or load DLLs in unusual ways. Malware often uses these techniques to persist across reboots or spread within a system.\n\nI'm not certain if all these actions are malicious, but the combination, especially the PowerShell activity and the svchost.exe behavior, raises enough red flags that this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe creating temporary files and accessing system components, along with svchost.exe loading DLLs from unusual paths, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first few events, I see multiple entries from svchost.exe. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. The tasks include setting registry values and creating files in SoftwareDistribution directories. These are known locations for update-related processes. However, I'm noticing several file creations with specific paths. For example, there's an .etl file being created under Windows Logs, which might be related to event tracing. But the multiple file creations from svchost.exe could be suspicious if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nThen there are events involving MpSigStub.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Defender. It loads MpClient.dll and creates a pipe. That seems normal since it's part of the antivirus process.\n\nNext, setup.exe creating files in the EdgeCore folder. This looks like standard installation activity. No red flags here.\n\nBut then I see powershell.exe events. The command line shows something about creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path to an unusual location: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That's concerning because it looks like someone is using PowerShell to create a service, which could be part of persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nAlso, the powershell.exe process accesses registry values and loads various DLLs. While some activity is normal, the combination with creating a service might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe activities could be part of legitimate Windows updates or something more nefarious. The suspicious point is the powershell.exe command that creates a new service with an unusual name and path. This could be an attempt to install malware that runs at startup, which is a common tactic for persistence.\n\nI'm also thinking about the frequency of events. There are multiple registry writes from svchost.exe and several file creations in known update directories, but without more context, it's hard to say if they're normal or part of an attack. However, the powershell activity stands out as potentially malicious because it's creating a service which could indicate installation of unauthorized software.\n\nSo, considering all these points together, there's enough evidence to suggest that this batch is worth investigating further. The confidence isn't super high, maybe around 0.7, since while some activities are suspicious, others might be normal. But the powershell activity in particular raises a red flag.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving svchost.exe creating files and modifying registry values, as well as powershell.exe executing commands that may indicate malicious activity, such as creating a new service with an unusual name and path.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. This is significant because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities due to its powerful command-line capabilities. The fact that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe raises my initial suspicion because attackers might use it to execute scripts or commands.\n\nLooking closer, several events show file operations like creating and deleting files in temporary directories. For example, there's a file being created at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1\" which is then deleted shortly after. This behavior could be indicative of testing script execution permissions or perhaps hiding malicious scripts by deleting them after use.\n\nAdditionally, I see that some events involve importing modules from specific paths, like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The structure of the command line in these events suggests they're invoking PowerShell with a script that's trying to import this module. This could be part of a larger malicious payload deployment.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation of a service using New-Service and starting it via Start-Service. Services are often used by attackers to achieve persistence on a system, meaning the malicious process can restart automatically after reboot. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" doesn't ring any bells as a legitimate Windows service, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe paths mentioned in these events also look unusual. For instance, \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\" and others under \"C:\\unidade_logico\\\" don't follow standard Windows directory structures, making them more suspicious. Legitimate software typically resides in well-known directories like Program Files or Windows.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated execution of similar PowerShell commands with slight variations might indicate a script that's trying different approaches to execute malicious code or bypass certain security measures. The use of try-catch blocks and error handling within these scripts could be attempts to make their execution less noisy or more resilient against interruptions.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there are multiple entries from both powershell.exe and tarefa_logico.exe. While I'm not sure about the exact nature of \"tarefa_logico.exe\", its involvement alongside PowerShell suggests it might be part of a malicious payload that's being executed by the script or used to handle certain tasks.\n\nIn summary, the combination of unusual file operations, repeated PowerShell executions, service creation, and non-standard directory paths points towards potentially malicious activity. The fact that these events are chained together in a sequence suggests they're part of a coordinated attack or an attempt at persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including file creation\/deletion, module imports from non-standard paths, and service creation suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are two types of events here: ones involving PowerShell and others related to remote command execution from a specific file path.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that `powershell.exe` is being used with commands to create and start a service called \"objeto_ativo\". The binary path points to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. Creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. Starting a new service could indicate an attempt to run malicious code at boot or maintain persistence.\n\nThen, there's a series of events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path mentioned is `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1`. This PowerShell script is being executed multiple times. Repeated execution of scripts could be part of an attack, especially if the script isn't commonly used or known.\n\nAdditionally, there are logon events from `services.exe`, which might not be suspicious on their own but combined with other activities, they could indicate a service-related attack vector.\n\nI should consider the frequency: multiple remote command executions and repeated PowerShell commands. This repetition could be part of an automated process or a script being run in a loop, which is often seen in attacks like ransomware or botnet activities.\n\nThe file paths are quite long and contain unusual characters and folder names, which might be attempts to hide malicious activity or avoid detection by standard security measures.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating services with PowerShell and executing a remote script multiple times raises red flags. These could be indicators of malicious activity such as installing backdoors, persistence mechanisms, or running payloads that cause damage.\n\nTherefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation because the activities described are indicative of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple PowerShell commands creating and starting a service, along with repeated execution of a remote script. These actions could indicate malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or payload delivery.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's see. I've got three JSONL events here. Each one has \"process\" as None, which probably means there's no associated process or it's unknown. The \"winlog\" field shows that each event is related to executing a remote command. That sounds suspicious because executing commands remotely can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the file paths: all three events point to the same script in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1. The filename suggests it's a PowerShell script, which is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. It's possible that an attacker is using this script to carry out remote commands on multiple systems or in sequence.\n\nSince all events are identical except for the line number, it indicates repetitive behavior, possibly part of a larger campaign. The consistent file path could mean the same malicious payload is being executed across different machines or at different times. This repetition raises flags because attackers might use such scripts to propagate or execute commands without detection.\n\nI'm also considering if these are legitimate events. While some remote command executions are normal in managed environments, the combination of three identical events targeting the same script makes it seem more suspicious. It could be part of automated testing or system updates, but given that each event is exactly the same, it's more likely indicative of malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't too high because without additional context like timestamps, user information, or the actual command executed, it's hard to be certain. However, the repetition and the nature of remote commands make this batch definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events showing repeated attempts to execute a remote command using the same script path, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
