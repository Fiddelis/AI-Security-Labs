{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. There are 15 events here, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is about \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating a file. The path looks like it's within the user's Office Solution Packages. That seems normal because SDXHelper is likely part of Microsoft Office's setup or updates. Then there are multiple similar events from the same process, all creating files with different filenames but in the same directory. I notice that some of these events repeat the same file paths, which might indicate that the same file is being created more than once, possibly due to retries or normal update processes.\n\nNext, there's an event where the process name is null and the task is \"Security Group Management.\" That catches my attention a bit because it's not clear what process is handling this. Null process names can sometimes be tricky because they might indicate background services or maybe something more nefarious if not properly logged. I'm wondering if this could be related to any security events, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are a couple of events from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating files in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used for collecting Windows logs, so that seems legitimate. The file being created is \".winlogbeat.yml.new,\" which probably relates to its configuration or data storage.\n\nLooking at the rest of the events, almost all are related to file creations by either SDXHelper.exe or winlogbeat.exe. These don't seem unusual on their own because applications often create temporary files or update cache directories. The repetition might just be part of a bulk operation, like installing updates or processing data.\n\nI should consider if any of these events could indicate malicious activity. For example, creating multiple files quickly could be part of a file injection attack, but in this case, the paths look legitimate and are within expected application directories. Also, SDXHelper.exe is commonly associated with Microsoft Office, which I can't find evidence of being compromised here.\n\nAnother point to consider is the null process name. If that event is related to security group management, maybe it's part of normal user rights administration. However, without knowing the exact source, it's a bit concerning. But given the surrounding events are benign, and there's no other suspicious activity like privilege escalations or deletions, I'm leaning towards this being a legitimate system operation.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, encryption of files (which would be a ransomware indicator), or network communications that might suggest command-and-control. The file creations here are all within standard user directories and by known processes.\n\nIn summary, while the null process name event is a bit ambiguous, the rest of the logs don't raise any red flags. They appear to be part of normal system operations, with applications updating files or configuration data. Without additional context or indicators of compromise, I wouldn't classify these events as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events does not indicate any suspicious activity from a cybersecurity perspective. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Events**: These are related to file creations within Microsoft Office directories, which is expected behavior for updates or normal operations.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Events**: These involve creating configuration files in the Downloads folder, which is typical for log collection agents.\n\n3. **Null Process Name Event**: This event relates to \"Security Group Management,\" likely a legitimate system operation, though less clear without additional context.\n\n4. **No Indicators of Malware**: No signs of file encryption, unauthorized access, or command-and-control activity are present.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events appear benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior. They likely represent normal application operations and routine system activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, most of the events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData directory. The files all have similar names with different hashes at the end, which looks like unique identifiers for each file. This seems repetitive but normal if SDXHelper is part of an application that generates or caches data.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they are located within \"Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\". That suggests these might be related to Office add-ins or custom solutions installed in Office. So, it's plausible that this helper exe is creating files for those packages.\n\nThere are two events from \"chrome.exe\" where a registry value was set. Since Chrome interacts with the Windows Registry for settings and extensions, this isn't unusual unless there's something suspicious about the keys being modified. But without more context on what specific registry values were changed, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just normal operation.\n\nI also notice that all the file creation events are under a single directory, which might indicate that SDXHelper is part of an installer or update process for an Office package. Alternatively, these could be log files or configuration files being generated during some routine operation.\n\nNo signs of unusual processes, user accounts, or network connections mentioned here. The events don't show any attempts to access restricted areas or exfiltrate data, which would be red flags for a security issue.\n\nSo overall, the logs seem normal. They fit typical behavior of an application helper creating files and a browser updating its registry settings.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs does not indicate any suspicious activity. The events are consistent with normal operations involving file creation by \"SDXHelper.exe\" related to Office packages and registry modifications by \"chrome.exe\". There is no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The activities are typical for an application helper creating files in a known directory and browser modifying registry settings.

Let me look at it step by step.\n\nFirst, all the entries are from \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's the same process creating multiple file creation events. The files being created are in a path that includes \"OfflineFiles\" and have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by various hashes or identifiers.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper sounds familiar. I think it's part of Microsoft Office, maybe handling some update or cache tasks. So, if this is a legitimate process from Microsoft, then the file creation might be normal. It could be that it's downloading or caching JavaScript files for some feature, perhaps related to AI or Copilot in newer versions of Office.\n\nBut wait, why so many different files? Is it creating multiple copies quickly? Maybe it's part of an update process where it's downloading several assets. Alternatively, if it's generating unique file names each time, could that be a sign of something else?\n\nI should check the location where these files are being saved. The path is under AppData, which is standard for application data storage. But within that, \"OfflineFiles\" might suggest they're intended to work without an internet connection, so it's normal for Office to cache such files.\n\nAlso, looking at the file names, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" and have different suffixes. This could mean they're different language packs or versions being downloaded. Each hash might correspond to a specific string file used in different contexts or languages.\n\nIs there any pattern that would make me think these are malicious? Well, if SDXHelper is a known legitimate process, then the activity here doesn't seem suspicious on first glance. However, if I were unsure about what SDXHelper does, I might look it up to confirm its legitimacy.\n\nAlso, considering the frequency of events—each one is a file creation by the same process—I don't immediately see any signs of unusual behavior like repeated failures or attempts to access restricted areas.\n\nSo putting it all together, unless there's additional context indicating that SDXHelper.exe is acting maliciously, this seems like normal activity related to Office software operations. It might be part of an update or cache refresh for features like Copilot.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate legitimate file creation activities by the Microsoft Office process \"SDXHelper.exe\". These files are being cached in the standard application data directory, likely as part of an update or feature (such as Copilot) requiring offline access. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in these logs. \n\n**Answer:** The activity is normal and related to legitimate operations of Microsoft Office software."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. So, I'm looking at these logs where the same process, \"SDXHelper.exe\", is creating files in a specific directory multiple times.\n\nFirst off, \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds like it's related to some software or tool that might be part of an application's setup or update routine. The fact that it's creating so many files with varying file names but the same prefix makes me think they could be different versions or parts of a larger process.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths: they're all in \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\[some company name]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\". This is a common location for applications to store temporary or cache files. So, this isn't immediately suspicious because legitimate apps do this all the time.\n\nBut wait, there are 14 events here, each creating a different file. That's a lot of activity from the same process in quick succession. If I were monitoring for anomalies, multiple writes could indicate something like a script or tool trying to write many files quickly, which might be part of an attack. However, given that all these files are under a standard user directory and named with predictable patterns, it doesn't seem malicious.\n\nAlso, the file names follow a consistent pattern: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[various hexadecimal].js\". The hex strings suggest they're unique identifiers or version numbers. This looks like regular caching of JavaScript modules or similar static assets, which is normal for web applications or plugins.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise here, like unusual file extensions, execution attempts, or deviations from expected behavior. It all aligns with typical application caching activities. So, while I should always be cautious, in this case, there's no clear sign of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of events does not indicate malicious activity. The process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating numerous files within a standard directory structure typically used for temporary or cache storage by legitimate applications. The consistent naming pattern and file location suggest these are routine operations, such as caching or updating, rather than signs of a security breach.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe events are likely part of normal application behavior and do not indicate suspicious activity. Therefore, the batch is **not malicious**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"event\": {\n    \"type\": \"batch_analysis\",\n    \"description\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a standard cache directory.\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"No signs of malicious intent; likely normal application behavior.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files. The file paths all point to different JavaScript files in an Office SolutionPackage directory. Each event shows a new JS file being created, but they're all under the same package ID and related to \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\". This seems repetitive—multiple writes by the same process to similar files.\n\nThen there are events from \"chrome.exe\", which involve setting registry values and loading DLLs for Windows Defender. These don't seem unusual since Chrome often interacts with system components, and Windows Defender is a legitimate service.\n\nI'm wondering if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is part of Microsoft's Office suite or some other legitimate software. If it's creating multiple JavaScript files, perhaps it's updating some resources or language packs. The repetitive file creation might be normal behavior for an application update or cache refresh.\n\nThe registry writes by Chrome could be related to settings or extensions. Since both processes are creating or modifying system components, but in standard areas (like Windows Defender DLLs), there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious activity.\n\nI don't see anything like unusual file permissions, execution from unexpected locations, or attempts to access restricted areas. All the events look like they're within expected operational parameters for their respective processes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the volume of events might be high, each individual action doesn't raise any red flags. There's no evidence here of unauthorized access, malware activity, or system compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\n\n- **Process Activities:**\n  - \"SDXHelper.exe\" is consistently creating multiple JavaScript files in a known Office directory. This suggests legitimate file operations, possibly for updates or cache purposes.\n  - \"chrome.exe\" interacts with Windows Defender components by loading DLLs and setting registry values, which are normal operations for browser extensions and system services.\n\n- **Behavior Indicators:**\n  - Repetitive file creation by the same process without unusual patterns indicates routine activity rather than suspicious behavior.\n  - All actions occur in standard system locations, with no signs of unauthorized access or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events analyzed do not exhibit any indicators of cybersecurity concern. They appear to be normal operational activities for legitimate software processes. Therefore, these logs are not deemed interesting for further investigation at this time."}

The user is a cybersecurity expert who needs to analyze a batch of system logs in JSONL format to determine if they're relevant for investigation. They want a single classification and justification.\n\nLooking at the events, I see multiple entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files related to Office packages. These might be legitimate updates or cache activities, so not immediately suspicious on their own. Then there's \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values and creating file streams for an Excel file download. It seems like normal user activity—downloading a document, opening it with Chrome or Excel.\n\nThere are also several entries from \"EXCEL.EXE\" loading various DLLs, which is standard behavior for an application starting up. The only event that stands out is the creation of a hidden file \"~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\", which is typically an Office temporary file. This could be normal if someone's working on the document but might indicate something malicious if it's unexpectedly present.\n\nConsidering all events together, most are routine and don't raise red flags.

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with process info, Windows logs, and sometimes file paths.\n\nFirst off, most of the events are from Excel.exe. It's doing various things like deleting files, creating files, loading images, and setting registry values. That sounds pretty normal because Excel is a common application that interacts with files and system resources. The files it's dealing with, like \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\", seem to be regular Excel documents. There are also events where Excel creates recent shortcut files, which I know happens when you open files in Windows.\n\nThen there are some entries from svchost.exe and SDXHelper.exe. Svchost is a common system process that can run various services, so seeing it log registry changes isn't unusual. It's probably just managing some settings. The SDXHelper.exe events are about creating specific JavaScript files in the Office package resources. Since these seem to be part of Microsoft Office updates or solution packages, they're likely legitimate.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe process creating a config file. That makes sense because it's an agent that probably logs system activity and needs its own configuration file.\n\nI notice there are multiple registry writes from Excel.exe. While some could be malicious, in this case, since they're happening during normal operations like opening files or loading plugins, they don't seem suspicious. The same goes for the file creations and deletions; they align with how Excel operates.\n\nThere's a File Delete event logged too. That could raise an eyebrow, but it's part of the process where Excel might clean up temporary files or old versions. For example, deleting \"~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" is typical when closing or saving a document in Office applications.\n\nI also check the file paths. They all point to standard locations like Downloads, AppData, and Program Files. There's nothing indicating they're going to unusual directories that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there doesn't seem to be any pattern of behavior that's out of the ordinary for a system running Excel normally. No signs of strange processes, unusual file accesses, or deviations from expected user activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal operations involving Microsoft Excel and related system processes.

Excel doing some registry changes isn't unusual since applications often modify system settings during operation. These events alone don't raise any red flags because legitimate software does this regularly.\n\nNext, I see several events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". It's performing file creation tasks. The paths mentioned are within the user's AppData folder under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. This looks like standard behavior for Office add-ins or components that store their resources locally. These files could be part of language packs or additional features, which is normal.\n\nThere's also a DNS query event from Excel, which again isn't suspicious on its own. Applications often perform DNS lookups for various legitimate purposes, like checking updates or connecting to services.\n\nI'm considering if these events collectively indicate any malicious activity.

The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if the batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each line represents an event where \"SDXHelper.exe\" creates a file in specific paths under the user's AppData directory. The files seem to be related to different language strings, like \"fr-ca-ui-strings-json\" or \"es-mx-ui-strings-json\". This suggests they're part of localized resources for software applications.\n\nI notice that many events are duplicates, such as the file path for \"eu-es-ui-strings-json\" appearing twice. Also, some package GUIDs change, but most stick to one specific package (36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b). This repetition makes me think these are standard operations during software updates or installations.\n\nSince \"SDXHelper.exe\" is commonly associated with legitimate software like Microsoft Office, the creation of these files is part of normal operation. There's no indication of unusual behavior, such as writing to unexpected directories or using elevated privileges. The file paths are within expected locations for user data.\n\nConsidering all this, the events don't raise any red flags. They're typical activities for a software application managing its resources. Therefore, there's no need for further investigation in terms of security concerns here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events provided indicate that the process `SDXHelper.exe` is creating files in the user's AppData directory. These files appear to be related to localized strings (e.g., \"fr-ca-ui-strings-json\") and are likely part of a legitimate software application, possibly Microsoft Office or another similar program.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Process Name**: `SDXHelper.exe` is commonly associated with Microsoft Office Suite updates and patches.\n2. **File Operations**: The process is creating files in the user's AppData directory under specific paths. These files contain language-specific strings, which are typical for applications that support multiple languages.\n3. **Repetition and Duplication**: Multiple events show similar file creation operations, some of which are duplicates (e.g., \"eu-es-ui-strings-json\" appears twice). This suggests a normal operational pattern rather than malicious activity.\n4. **Package GUIDs**: The package GUIDs indicate that these files belong to specific software packages, further supporting the idea that this is legitimate activity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis batch of events does not appear suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let me try to make sense of them. So, first off, the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Each event seems to be a Windows log event, probably from something like Event Viewer or similar monitoring tools.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them involve \"File created\" tasks. The process name associated with these file creations is \"SDXHelper.exe\". This process sounds familiar; I think it's related to Microsoft Office add-ins or perhaps some kind of package installation. The files being created are located in various paths under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages and so on. These look like they're part of the Office Solution Packages, maybe for language packs or additional features.\n\nI notice that several events have the same file path but different strings attached to them—like different JSON files for various languages (gu-in, hr-hr, hu-hu, etc.). It seems like these are being created as part of a normal update or installation process. Since all these are under \"SDXHelper.exe\", it's likely that this is the process responsible for handling those packages.\n\nThen there are some events where the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and \"svchost.exe\". The Excel event is setting a registry value, which isn't unusual if Excel is being updated or configured. The svchost.exe events involve registry modifications as well—adding or deleting objects, and setting values. SvcHost is a generic host process for services, so these could be related to various Windows services updating their configurations.\n\nI should check if these activities are normal. In a typical system, especially with Microsoft Office installed, processes like SDXHelper.exe would handle package installations and updates. The file creation events might be part of installing or updating language packs or other add-ins for Office. Similarly, Excel and svchost activities in the registry could be standard operations during software updates or service changes.\n\nIs there any indication that these are malicious? Well, \"svchost.exe\" is a common process, but sometimes malware can inject into it. However, without seeing specific indicators like unusual file paths or timestamps, or knowing if this activity deviates from baseline, I can't say for sure. But given the context provided and the typical nature of these processes, they don't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the number of identical file creation events for different language strings under the same package path. It makes me think that maybe a lot of add-ins or language packs are being installed or updated in one go, which could be normal if, say, multiple users' data is being processed or if the system is part of an organization with various language support.\n\nAlso, towards the end, there are two events where both process and file are null. That's a bit odd; maybe they're leftover entries or placeholders for incomplete events. They don't seem critical though.\n\nIn summary, most of these logs appear to be related to normal Office-related processes: installing add-ins, language packs, updating registry settings. Unless there's evidence of unauthorized access or known malicious activities linked to these processes, I wouldn't flag them as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:**\n   - The logs consist of 18 events, primarily involving file creation tasks by \"SDXHelper.exe\" and registry modifications by \"svchost.exe\" and \"EXCEL.EXE.\"\n\n2. **File Creation Events:**\n   - These are initiated by \"SDXHelper.exe,\" creating files in paths under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`. The files include JSON strings for various languages, suggesting language pack installations or updates.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - \"EXCEL.EXE\" sets a registry value, likely during configuration.\n   - \"svchost.exe\" performs multiple registry operations, which are common for services but can be points of interest if they deviate from normal patterns.\n\n4. **Identifying Processes:**\n   - \"SDXHelper.exe\" is related to Microsoft Office's solution packages, handling add-ins and updates.\n   - \"EXCEL.EXE\" is the Excel process, with standard operations.\n   - \"svchost.exe\" is a generic host for services, so its actions depend on which service is running.\n\n5. **Assessing Normalcy:**\n   - The observed activities align with normal operations during software updates or installations of language packs and add-ins in an Office environment.\n   \n6. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - While \"svchost.exe\" can be used by malware, without additional indicators like unusual file paths or timestamps, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The events are likely part of normal system operations related to Microsoft Office updates and configurations. Unless there's external evidence suggesting otherwise, they don't indicate suspicious behavior.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events primarily documents normal system activities associated with the installation or update of Microsoft Office components and language packs. \"SDXHelper.exe\" handles file creation for these packages, while \"EXCEL.EXE\" and \"svchost.exe\" manage configuration changes through registry modifications. There's no clear indication of malicious activity; thus, these events are likely benign and part of routine software operations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"process\": \"Benign\",\n    \"details\": \"The log entries indicate normal system activities related to Microsoft Office updates and configurations.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are two types: those from \"SDXHelper.exe\" and those from \"EXCEL.EXE\". The SDXHelper.exe events are about file creation tasks. Each one creates a new file in specific paths under the user's AppData directory for Microsoft Office Solution Packages. The files seem to be JavaScript resource files with different language codes, like ko-kr for Korean, kok-in for Indonesian, etc. There are multiple instances of these file creations.\n\nThen there are events from EXCEL.EXE, all related to registry value sets. Each event is the same: Excel modifying a registry entry. There are 17 such events in a row. That's quite repetitive and seems like a lot for normal Excel operations.\n\nI'm wondering if these activities are within normal user behavior or if they indicate something malicious. SDXHelper.exe might be part of Office add-ins or updates, so creating files in those directories could be legitimate. However, the number of file creations is significant, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nOn the other hand, Excel repeatedly modifying registry values could be suspicious. Registry modifications are often indicators of malicious activity because attackers might set persistence mechanisms there. If this happened once or a few times, it might not raise flags, but 17 instances in a row seem excessive and possibly indicative of something like a loop or automated process that shouldn't be happening during normal Excel usage.\n\nAnother point is the combination of these two processes. SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple files, which could be part of an Office package update, but paired with Excel making many registry changes, it might suggest some form of lateral movement or persistence setup by malware. Malware often uses legitimate tools and processes to hide its activities.\n\nI'm also considering whether the file paths are normal. The paths point to specific language resources within Office packages. If these files were created without user interaction, it could be part of a software update or installation. However, if this happens during a time when no updates are being applied, it might be suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while some events could be legitimate, the sheer number of repeated registry modifications by Excel is concerning. It's possible that this indicates malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or alter system configurations in a way that's not typical for normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe and repeated registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, the user provided four JSONL entries, each representing an event where a file was created by SDXHelper.exe. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the process name: SDXHelper.exe. That sounds familiar—maybe it's related to some Microsoft Office package? The paths in the files are all under \"Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages,\" which suggests these are legitimate parts of an Office installation or updates.\n\nEach event is a file creation task. The files have names like ml-in-ui-strings-json and mr-in-ui-strings-json, with different language codes (like 'ne-np' for Nepali). These seem to be resource files used by Office for localization or UI strings. Since these are being created under the OfflineFiles directory, it's likely part of an offline installation process where such resources are copied locally.\n\nI'm checking if there's anything malicious here. SDXHelper.exe is a known component in Microsoft Office, used for setup and updates. The files are standard resource files. No signs of unusual paths or indicators of compromise like executable files or writes to unexpected locations.\n\nConsidering all four events together, they all follow the same pattern—same process creating similar files in expected locations. This looks normal during an Office installation or update rather than malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch represents legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft Office-related process (SDXHelper.exe) during the setup or update of Office components. The files are localized resource strings stored in expected locations, indicating normal software operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
