Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so it can be tricky. The first few lines show powershell being accessed, which isn't too unusual on its own. But then I see a command line that includes creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to some exe file. That's interesting because creating services is often used in persistence mechanisms by attackers.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, which makes sense as powershell loads various DLLs when running scripts or commands. But the specific paths like clr.dll and mscoree.dll are normal for .NET related processes, so that's not a red flag yet.\n\nThen there's a FileDeleteDetected event where a temporary PS script is being deleted. That's suspicious because attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting logs or scripts they execute. The fact that it's a Powershell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... makes me think it might be related to some policy testing, but the deletion could indicate an attempt to hide something.\n\nLooking further, there are events from services.exe writing to the registry multiple times. Services.exe is part of Windows and handles service-related tasks, so it's legitimate, but repeated writes could be a sign of malicious activity trying to establish persistence or modify service configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows powershell being used to create a new service with a specific binary path, deletion of a script file, and multiple registry modifications. These actions collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, possibly related to creating persistent backdoors or installing malware components.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe events including process creation with suspicious command lines, file deletions, and registry modifications.

Let's break down what I see here.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from different processes. The first two events involve 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading some .NET framework DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. These seem normal because those DLLs are part of the .NET framework, which is legitimate software. So, their loading isn't inherently suspicious.\n\nThen, there's a series of events from powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be worth looking into. But on its own, creating a profile data file might not be malicious—it could just be a script running during startup.\n\nNext, I see several entries from services.exe and svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. Services.exe is part of Windows for managing services, so it's normal to see activity here. Svchost.exe is also a common process that hosts various services, including those from third-party applications. The fact that both are modifying the registry could be concerning because malicious actors often use registry modifications to persist in the system.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple repeated entries from svchost.exe performing Registry value sets. This repetition might indicate something unusual, like a script or process looping to make changes frequently. However, it's also possible that this is part of legitimate Windows operations or third-party service activity.\n\nThe last event involves MsMpEng.exe setting a registry value. MsMpEng.exe is related to Microsoft Monitoring Platform, which can be used for system monitoring and might not be malicious on its own unless it's being abused.\n\nConsidering all these events together, I don't see any clear indicators of immediate malicious behavior. The activities could be part of legitimate processes or normal system operations. However, the repetitive registry modifications by svchost.exe and services.exe might warrant closer inspection to ensure they aren't part of a larger compromise or persistence mechanism.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities, including legitimate processes loading necessary DLLs, PowerShell creating profile data, and services modifying the registry.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that there are multiple events from 'svchost.exe' where registry values are being set or objects modified. Svchost is a common process in Windows, often related to services, so these might be normal operations unless they're unusual.\n\nThen, there are several events from 'setup.exe'. These show file creation tasks pointing to various .exe files and batch scripts within the Microsoft Edge directory. Setup.exe is typically used for software installation, so creating these files could be part of installing or updating software. The paths look legitimate, related to Edge browser components.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created in 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe', which seems like a standard location for the Edge executable. This doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nI also see some events from 'services.exe' doing registry modifications, which again is typical for services running on Windows, so that's not suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to be part of a legitimate software installation or update process. The combination of setup.exe creating files and both svchost.exe and services.exe modifying the registry are common during such activities. There's no indication of malicious behavior like unusual file creation locations, unexpected processes accessing restricted areas, or repeated failed attempts that might suggest a breach.\n\nTherefore, while individual events might look suspicious on their own, when looked at as a whole, they form a coherent sequence of actions related to installing or updating software, which isn't concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate software installation activities by setup.exe and normal registry operations by svchost.exe and services.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, the user has given a series of JSONL events and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually to understand what's happening. The events involve processes like setup.exe, services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe. These are all common system processes, so that doesn't immediately raise any red flags.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, I see a lot of 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted'. Registry activities can be normal during software installations or updates, but excessive changes might indicate something malicious. However, in this case, setup.exe is doing these registry operations, which makes sense as it's part of the installation process for Microsoft Edge.\n\nThere are also some file creation events. Setup.exe is creating files like msedge_proxy.exe and a shortcut to Microsoft Edge.lnk. Svchost.exe, known for hosting system services, is creating temporary appx files in the Windows Temp directory. This aligns with typical Windows updates or installations where files are extracted temporarily.\n\nI notice that some events mention 'Pipe Created', which is another normal operation for processes to communicate over named pipes. No unusual patterns here.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem consistent with a legitimate software installation or update process. The combination of registry modifications, file creations in standard directories, and pipe creation are all typical during such operations. There's no evidence of unusual file paths or multiple suspicious activities that would suggest malicious behavior.\n\nThe confidence level is high because each individual event aligns with normal system behaviors, and there's nothing indicating an attack or unauthorized access. No signs of privilege escalation, encrypted communications, or known malicious process names beyond what's expected.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are consistent with legitimate software installation and system processes.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events where the process is svchost.exe creating files. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process that can be legitimate but also used by malware because it's a generic name. The files being created have paths like C:\\Windows\\Temp and C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness. Some of these file names look suspicious, especially the temporary file in the Temp directory and the ones with long GUID-like names in AppReadiness. I'm wondering if these could be part of malicious activities, maybe creating files to drop payloads or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, there are events where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Registry modifications can indicate both normal system operations and malicious activity since attackers often set registry keys for persistence or to modify system behavior. The fact that there are multiple such events makes me think something might be off, as legitimate processes usually don't make frequent registry changes unless installing software.\n\nNext, I see an event involving RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is related to Windows Store and app management, so this could be normal, but it's worth keeping an eye on because sometimes malware can misuse legitimate processes.\n\nThe big red flag here is the PowerShell activity. There's a process creation event for powershell.exe with a command line that runs Write-Host to output 'Final result: 1'. Using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted is unusual because that restricts script execution, which might be an attempt to hide malicious scripts by preventing them from running. The command itself seems benign, but the combination of using restricted policies and creating files in Temp could indicate script injection or testing for persistence.\n\nLooking deeper into the PowerShell events: it loads several .NET framework DLLs, which is normal, but then creates a file in Temp named __PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1. The '.dpa' extension isn't common and might be part of a script testing process or something more nefarious like dropping a malicious script. Additionally, the creation of a pipe (Pipe Created event) could indicate communication between processes, which is often used in command-and-control scenarios.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe creating multiple files with suspicious names, making registry changes, and PowerShell running with restricted execution policy plus file creation in Temp suggest potential malicious activity. These behaviors don't align with typical user actions or legitimate software operations. The repeated events could be part of a larger attack chain, like dropping malware components or establishing persistence.\n\nI'm confident enough to say that this batch is interesting because it combines multiple suspicious activities across different processes and types of log entries. Each event alone might not raise too many flags, but together they paint a concerning picture.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in unusual locations, modifying the registry, and PowerShell activity with restricted execution policy and file creation suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs from system activities. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is 'whoami.exe' being run with the command line pointing to its path. That seems normal; users often check their credentials, but sometimes malicious actors use it too. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process accessed. Then, another event where PowerShell creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Creating files in non-standard locations might be suspicious, especially under AppData. Maybe setting up persistence?\n\nLooking further, I see multiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell. It's loading various DLLs, which is normal for scripts but could indicate malicious activity if they're accessing known bad libraries.\n\nThere's a command line argument with some PowerShell code that checks INF files looking for specific patterns. That seems like it's trying to detect whether certain features are installed. Maybe attempting to disable something? Also, the script writes the result, so maybe trying to check if the environment is clean before executing further commands.\n\nThen, cmd.exe runs a Dism command to disable and remove Windows Defender with \"\/quiet\" flag. Disabling antivirus is a red flag because attackers often do this to avoid detection.\n\nDism.exe creates some temporary files in the user's AppData directory, which seems odd because it's usually run by admins for system changes. Creating files there might be an attempt to hide or inject malicious code.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell accessing and creating files, especially targeting Defender and using Dism to disable security features. These activities are often indicators of a potential attack, like disabling antivirus to prevent detection or installing malicious payloads. So, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution attempting to disable Windows Defender and file operations in temporary directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format with three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst off, the process name across all events is consistently \"Dism.exe\". I know that Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services, often used for deploying and configuring Windows images. It's a legitimate system process, so that doesn't immediately raise any red flags.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most of these events are marked as \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. This suggests that the system is monitoring file executions and flagging them for some reason. However, since Dism.exe is a standard Windows tool, it's normal for it to execute files during its operations.\n\nThe file paths in each event point to various .dll and .mui files located in temporary directories under \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\". The fact that these are temp files isn't concerning on its own because many legitimate applications use temporary storage. The naming conventions like DismCorePS.dll, DismHost.exe, and various language-specific .mui files (like en-US) seem related to deployment services.\n\nI also notice that the events include both creation and detection tasks. For example, one event shows \"File created\" while others are about detecting executables. This could be part of a normal installation or configuration process where multiple components are being loaded.\n\nNow, considering all these together: legitimate process name, standard file operations in temp directories, related to deployment services—nothing jumps out as malicious here. The repeated detection might just be due to the system monitoring known processes. There's no evidence of unusual file names, access patterns, or times that would suggest a breach or attack.\n\nSo, while each individual event could be worth noting, when viewed as a whole batch, there's no indication of suspicious behavior.

This is a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing operating system images. The winlog task mentions \"File Executable Detected,\" which sounds like it's monitoring executable files being created or modified.\n\nLooking at each file path, they all point to temporary directories under 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp' with various DLL files named Provider.dll.mui and one FfuProvider.dll. The paths include different language folders (en-US) and various provider names like ImagingProvider, IntlProvider, LogProvider, etc.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is used for tasks like adding or removing features from an OS image, updating drivers, etc. During such operations, it's normal for the system to create or copy several DLL files into temporary directories as part of the servicing process. These DLLs are likely part of the OS image being processed.\n\nThe fact that each event is generated by Dism.exe and all point to the same user directory suggests this is a single operation. The repetition of similar file paths indicates it's processing multiple components or languages as part of the image servicing task.\n\nSince Dism.exe is a standard system tool, and the activities described are typical during legitimate OS updates or image modifications, these events don't raise any red flags. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual process behavior, or signs of malware here.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs doesn't seem to indicate malicious activity.

So, it's not inherently malicious; in fact, it's part of the system.\n\nThen there's the \"winlog\" field indicating that a file executable was detected (rule: FileExecutableDetected). That sounds like a security event where something flagged an executable file. But I need to consider what the file is and its context.\n\nLooking at each file path: all these files are located under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by some GUID-like folder, and then various DLLs with names like FolderProvider.dll, GenericProvider.dll, etc. The naming seems consistent across different provider types, which suggests they might be part of a legitimate process.\n\nI recall that Dism.exe often works with temporary files when servicing images or performing updates. It's common for it to extract various .dll files into temp directories during its operations.

The next events are similar—same process name, same task in winlog about file deletion, but different file names. It looks like each event is another file being deleted by Dism.exe.\n\nWait, what's Dism.exe? I remember it's part of the Windows Deployment Services.

The user provided some logs with various keys like \"process,\" \"winlog,\" and \"file.\" Each entry seems to have different values under these keys.\n\nFirst off, the first log has a complex value for \"process\" that includes a long string of what looks like base64 encoding or maybe something else. It's all hexadecimal digits. The \"winlog\" field here mentions some task related to security events with a specific rule about process creation. That makes sense because it's likely capturing when a new process starts.\n\nThe second log shows \"svchost.exe\" under \"process,\" which is a common system process, but the winlog indicates a registry value being set. I know svchost can be used by malware to hide their processes, so that might be something to look into.\n\nThen there are several logs where both \"process\" and \"winlog\" have values indicating powershell commands being executed. Powershell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The command lines show creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an exe file in a specific path.\n\nI see multiple entries with the same powershell command, which suggests this script might be running several times or part of a loop. Also, there are some entries where the process is the same but the winlog task changes from \"Provider Lifecycle\" to \"Engine Lifecycle.\" I'm not entirely sure what that signifies, so maybe I should look up what those terms mean in the context of Windows logs.\n\nThe last few logs show powershell being run with a restricted execution policy and outputting a message. Restricted policies usually prevent scripts from running unless they're explicitly allowed, which could indicate an attempt to hide something or ensure commands are executed without much interference.\n\nLooking at the file field, it's mostly null, so no files are being logged here, but the process is creating new services, which might imply some persistence mechanism.\n\nI'm a bit confused about why there are multiple entries with similar processes and what each winlog task exactly represents. Also, I'm not sure if the base64-like string in the first entry is part of an exploit or just some encoding for legitimate purposes.\n\nTo make sense of this, maybe I should correlate these events over time, see how they interact, and check if there are any deviations from normal behavior patterns. It might also be helpful to analyze the file paths mentioned in the powershell commands to ensure they're legitimate and not part of a malicious payload.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs you provided contain information about processes, Windows log tasks, and files. Each entry is enclosed in curly braces and contains fields for \"process,\" \"winlog,\" and \"file.\" The entries seem to be related to process creation, registry events, and PowerShell commands.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the logs:\n\n1. **First Log:**\n   - `process`: Contains a long hexadecimal string.\n   - `winlog`: Indicates a security event with a specific rule about process creation.\n   - `file`: No file information.\n\n2. **Second Log:**\n   - `process`: `\"svchost.exe\"`\n   - `winlog`: Indicates a registry value set event.\n\n3. **Third Log:**\n   - All fields are `None`.\n\n4. **Fourth to Twelfth Logs:**\n   - `process`: Contains a command line for powershell.exe, including creating and starting a new service named `\"objeto_ativo\"`.\n   - `winlog`: Indicates events related to provider or engine lifecycle.\n\n13. **Thirteenth Log:**\n   - `process`: A powershell.exe command that writes a message.\n   - `winlog`: Provider lifecycle event.\n\nThis pattern suggests that the logs are part of a process monitoring system, possibly detecting malicious activities like service creation and PowerShell commands. The repeated PowerShell commands suggest an attempt to create or start a service, which could be part of a malware payload or legitimate administrative activity."}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events are related to PowerShell executions on Windows systems. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities. However, I know that many normal administrative tasks also use PowerShell, so context is important here.\n\nLooking at each event, the command lines vary slightly but generally involve using `Get-Item` to access files in specific directories like `C:\\Windows\\inf\\`, then reading their contents with `Get-Content`. The commands are checking if the content matches a specific pattern related to installation sections (`[defaultinstall.nt...]`). This seems to be a script that's scanning for certain types of INF files, which might indicate an attempt to detect or enumerate driver-related information.\n\nOne thing I notice is that the command line uses `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which means it's running under a restricted execution policy. While this can sometimes be a red flag because scripts might not run as expected, in this case, it's part of the script itself and doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity since the script isn't doing anything beyond reading files.\n\nThe `winlog` field shows tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are common Windows event log categories related to system service lifecycle events. They don't by themselves indicate any unusual behavior, but combined with the PowerShell command lines, they might suggest that these commands are part of system initialization or shutdown processes.\n\nAnother point is that multiple instances of similar commands are present across different events. This repetition could be normal if it's part of a routine check or script execution. However, repeated attempts to access certain files or directories can sometimes indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nI'm considering whether the script's purpose is legitimate. The script seems to be looking for specific patterns in INF files, which might be related to checking for device drivers or system configurations. If this is part of a legitimate process like hardware detection or system setup, it's probably not malicious. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI also note that the command doesn't seem to perform any actions beyond reading and writing; it just sets a variable based on whether certain patterns are found. The `Write-Host` commands outputting 'Final result: 1' or similar suggest that the script is checking for something, possibly as part of a larger process.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying these events as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because they appear to be part of normal system operations. However, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes attackers use legitimate tools in unexpected ways, and repeated scans could be part of data gathering for a future attack.\n\nI should also consider if there are any red flags specific to the command lines or execution context. The use of `powershell.exe` with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is standard for scripts that need to run without executing other scripts, which can sometimes be used by attackers to bypass certain restrictions. But in this case, since the script isn't doing anything malicious, just checking files, it's likely benign.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the fact that all events are from the same source and repeat similar commands, but no other indicators like privilege escalation, network communication, or file modifications are present, makes me more confident that these are not part of a malicious activity.\n\nIn conclusion, while PowerShell is a tool of interest in cybersecurity, without evidence of malicious actions or clear indicators of compromise (like writing to unexpected locations, encrypting files, etc.), I would classify these events as not interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves multiple instances of PowerShell commands executing scripts that check for specific patterns in INF files under the `C:\\Windows\\inf` directory. These commands are run with the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag, which is standard for scripts needing restricted execution. The tasks logged are typical Windows system processes, and there's no evidence of malicious actions such as file modifications or network communication. Given the lack of indicators of compromise and the repetitive nature suggesting a legitimate routine check, these events are classified as:\n\n**Classification: NOT INTERESTING**\n\nRationale:\n- Commands appear to be part of normal system operations.\n- No signs of malicious activity or privilege escalation.\n- Repetition could indicate routine checks rather than malicious intent."}
