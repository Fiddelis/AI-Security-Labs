Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nThe first few entries are about processes starting and accessing things. I notice that whoami.exe ran normally, so that seems okay. But then there are multiple PowerShell executions. Each time, the command line looks suspicious—it's using findstr to search for \"pass\" in various file types and then using select-string with a pattern for \"password.\" That sounds like it's looking for sensitive information.\n\nThe events also show PowerShell accessing registry values and loading images. These actions could be normal, but combined with the command-line arguments, they raise flags. Also, there are file creation and deletion events in a temporary directory, which might indicate that a script is being written and then deleted to avoid detection. This behavior is common in malware or scripts meant to hide their presence.\n\nAnother red flag is multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from PowerShell with the same command line. Repeated process creations and activity without clear justification could mean someone is trying to execute malicious code repeatedly, maybe attempting to bypass certain security measures or just testing different approaches.\n\nPutting it all together, these events suggest potential unauthorized access attempts using PowerShell for data extraction. The repeated patterns and file handling in temp directories are concerning signs of possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including searching for 'password' in various file types, repeated process creations with similar command lines, and file operations in a temporary directory suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal because it's part of the log shipping process. Then, notepad.exe setting a registry value—probably just configuration changes, nothing suspicious.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing processes and loading an image. I know that PowerShell can be used for both good and evil, so some actions might warrant closer look. There are multiple events from powershell.exe, including command lines with 'findstr' searching for 'pass' in various files. That seems like it's looking for passwords, which could be malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there's a process where conhost.exe and others set registry values—these might just be legitimate processes running, but seeing so many from chrome.exe setting registry values is odd. Typically, Chrome shouldn't need to modify the registry that much. Also, multiple events with the same task type from the same process could indicate automated or malicious behavior.\n\nThe repeated use of 'findstr' searching for sensitive terms and powershell.exe's command lines manipulating strings related to passwords raises red flags. Additionally, the Engine Lifecycle task in PowerShell might be part of script execution, which when combined with the other activities, suggests potential malicious scripting.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple registry modifications by different processes, especially Chrome, and the use of PowerShell for string manipulation and searching sensitive terms is concerning. This batch likely indicates suspicious or potentially malicious activity that deserves investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from powershell.exe with suspicious command lines involving search for 'pass' in files, as well as numerous registry modifications by various processes which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of logs. There are 20 events here, each from different processes. Most of them are from chrome.exe, which is doing various tasks like DNS queries, registry changes, and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot in the background.\n\nThen there are some events from winlogbeat.exe creating files, probably setting up or updating configuration files. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThe interesting parts come from powershell.exe. It's creating files with names like 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. That could be part of normal script execution, but I wonder what those filenames mean. They seem to suggest some structured or logical object, which might not be inherently malicious, but it's worth noting.\n\nThere's also a process access event on powershell.exe and a whoami.exe run. The whoami command is often used by scripts or tools to check permissions, which can be part of recon or privilege escalation. Combined with the file creations, this could indicate some level of activity that might be malicious.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear signs of an ongoing attack here, but the use of powershell.exe and the specific filenames along with process access and whoami could be red flags. It's possible that someone is using these tools for legitimate purposes, like script execution or debugging, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nSo overall, there are some elements that catch my attention, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from chrome.exe performing network connections and registry modifications, as well as powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple cmd.exe processes running schtasks commands with delete operations on task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\". Schtasks is a legitimate Windows command used for scheduling tasks, but deleting tasks can be part of malicious activity to remove traces or disrupt system functions. So that's a red flag.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands remotely. The fact that it's accessed several times without clear legitimate reason could indicate an attempt to run scripts for malicious purposes.\n\nThere are also instances where svchost.exe modifies the registry. SvcHost is a generic process name for services, but unusual registry modifications could be signs of malware installation or configuration changes to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking at WMIC.exe events, I notice it's being used with command-line arguments to delete notepad.exe processes and load various DLLs. WMIC can be misused for remote command execution and process management. The deletion of notepad.exe might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt normal operations.\n\nThe repeated use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks suggests someone is trying to remove scheduled tasks, possibly to cover their tracks or to prevent certain actions from being executed. This kind of activity can be a sign of a potential attack, like a cleanup phase after compromising the system.\n\nI also notice multiple registry modifications and image loads for DLLs like urlmon.dll, which are legitimate but could be part of malicious activities trying to load arbitrary modules or inject code into processes.\n\nTaking all these events together, they show a pattern of process creation, deletion of tasks and other processes (like notepad.exe), and registry changes. These behaviors can be indicative of malware attempting to execute commands, modify system configurations, and cover its tracks by deleting evidence. The repeated use of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, schtasks.exe, and WMIC.exe in suspicious ways adds up to a concerning pattern that's worth investigating further.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some individual events might be benign, the combination suggests malicious intent, such as persistence mechanisms or system disruption. Therefore, this batch should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including command execution, task deletion, and registry modifications indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are multiple entries showing the creation and access of various processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, etc. The repetition stands out—powershell is accessed several times, which could be normal but might also indicate something suspicious since attackers often use it for command execution or lateral movement.\n\nI notice that many events involve deleting user accounts via commands like 'net user \/del' and similar in cmd and net1.exe. Deleting user accounts can be part of system administration, but the volume here is quite high. The consistent targeting of specific Admin-suffixed usernames raises a red flag. It looks like someone might be trying to clean up traces or escalate privileges.\n\nMoreover, there are several instances where these processes modify registry values. Registry modifications can be malicious, especially if they're attempting persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations without proper authorization.\n\nThe combination of multiple process creations and deletions, along with registry changes, makes the entire batch concerning. It's possible that an attacker is using these tools to perform reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The fact that this activity isn't isolated but spans across many events suggests a coordinated effort rather than random legitimate actions.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence because the patterns and activities don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations and deletions, including powershell.exe accesses and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format with three fields: process, winlog, and file. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there's a cmd.exe process deleting something related to 'win32times'. That sounds suspicious because it's an unfamiliar service name. Then, I see multiple powershell.exe processes being accessed and interacting with the registry. Powershell can be a red flag if used in unusual ways since it's often associated with scripting and potential malicious activities.\n\nI notice several instances where services.exe is modifying registry values. Services.exe is legitimate, but repeated registry modifications could indicate tampering or installation of malware. There are also cmd.exe processes deleting files in the Temp directory, which might be trying to remove evidence or clean up after an attack.\n\nThe later events show conhost.exe and whoami.exe being run. Conhost is sometimes used by malicious scripts as a host process for other activities. Whoami is usually benign but could be part of privilege escalation attempts.\n\nMultiple powershell.exe entries with different command lines, including some with '& {}' which looks like an attempt to run arbitrary code or perhaps obfuscation techniques. The 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in the winlog might indicate that Powershell was used for something malicious, as those terms can relate to script execution.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's a pattern of system process creations, registry modifications, file deletions, and powershell activities which are often red flags. The combination suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes including cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and services.exe showing registry modifications and file deletions indicative of possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed. Some have command lines like \"&{}\", which is a bit unusual but could be part of normal scripting. Then, I notice that powershell.exe is accessing the registry and setting values. That's a common activity for scripts to do, so not sure if it's malicious yet.\n\nThere are also events where files are being created and deleted in temporary directories. For example, creating \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1\" and then deleting it. This could be part of testing script policies or perhaps trying to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself. But I'm not certain if that's a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the loading of various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. That seems normal for powershell.exe since it uses those libraries. However, the fact that they're being loaded multiple times might be worth looking into, but I don't think it's inherently suspicious.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This could be part of legitimate script execution or something more nefarious trying to persistence. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are events from whoami.exe being executed multiple times. Whoami is often used by scripts to check permissions and might not be malicious on its own, but repeated use could indicate probing the system for information.\n\nI also see winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log management, so that's probably benign unless it's being misused, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the powershell.exe activities include both normal and potentially suspicious actions. The repeated process creations, registry modifications, file operations, and the use of whoami could be part of a script trying to escalate privileges or gather information. However, without seeing actual malicious code execution or known bad indicators, it's hard to classify this as definitely malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards INTERESTING because while individually some events might not raise flags, together they suggest potentially exploratory or privilege-escalation activities that could warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including file creation\/deletion in temp directories, registry modifications, and repeated process creations with whoami.exe, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I'm looking at a batch of events from system logs, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. The first event is about 'whoami.exe' being created. That's a common tool used to get user information. It's usually innocent unless it's part of something else.\n2. Next, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is accessed. I know that PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, like executing scripts or commands. So repeated access could be suspicious.\n3. There's an entry about 'RuntimeBroker.exe' modifying the registry. That's normal for some Windows processes, but sometimes malware uses registry changes to persistence.\n4. Notepad accessing the registry also stands out a bit. While not impossible, it's less common and could indicate something fishy.\n5. Then there are events where 'calc.exe' loads a DLL (urlmon.dll). That seems odd because Calculator usually doesn't need that DLL for its function.\n6. 'svchost.exe' modifying the registry multiple times is another red flag. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be used by malware to hide malicious activities.\n7. There's an event where a file '.winlogbeat.yml.new' is created by 'winlogbeat.exe'. That seems related to log management, which might not be suspicious on its own unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n8. More PowerShell accesses follow, reinforcing the earlier thought about potential misuse.\n9. Entries like 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' and another Calculator accessing the registry continue the trend of unusual activities.\n10. Finally, Chrome has multiple DNS queries and network connections. While that can be normal browsing activity, frequent queries could indicate data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at all these together, I notice a pattern of processes associated with potential threats: repeated PowerShell accesses, registry modifications by non-standard processes, unusual DLL loads in benign apps like Calculator, and multiple Chrome activities which might be part of command and control communication. These collectively suggest that the batch might indicate malicious behavior. \n\nHowever, some events could be legitimate too, especially if it's a system with many services running or users accessing different applications. But considering the combination—especially the number of times processes associated with potential threats appear—it raises concerns about an attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including repeated PowerShell accesses and unusual process behaviors.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
