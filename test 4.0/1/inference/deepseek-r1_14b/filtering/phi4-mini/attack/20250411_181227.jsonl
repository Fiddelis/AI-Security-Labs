{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe' with command lines that create scheduled tasks. The commands are setting up new scheduled tasks using PowerShell. The actions are executing calc.exe at logon, and they're being registered under different names like 'unidade_ativo$object', 'registro_geral$object', etc. This immediately raises a red flag because creating multiple scheduled tasks with administrative privileges could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nNext, there are events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle'. I'm not exactly sure what that entails, but since it's paired with powershell.exe processes, it might relate to task registration or deactivation. Still, combined with the previous points, this adds to the suspicion.\n\nThen there are a few entries where the file path is null and other events involving registry value sets, process accesses, and image loads related to PowerShell and mscoree.dll, clr.dll. These could be indicators of malicious activities like loading certain libraries or modules which might be obfuscated or used for executing commands.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and sequence, there's a pattern where multiple scheduled tasks are being created in quick succession, each with similar but slightly different names. This kind of activity isn't typical user behavior; users usually don't create numerous scheduled tasks, especially ones that execute calc.exe on logon. Additionally, the fact that these tasks are targeting the BUILTIN\\Administrators group and set to run at the highest level suggests they're trying to maintain elevated privileges.\n\nThe presence of mscoree.dll and clr.dll being loaded by PowerShell could indicate an attempt to use .NET framework components for malicious purposes, like encoding or executing code. This adds another layer to the potential threat.\n\nAlso, there's a process where chrome.exe creates a pipe. While that's more common, combined with all the other PowerShell activities, it might be part of communication channels between different processes or malware components.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple scheduled tasks being created by PowerShell scripts, elevated privileges, and loading of specific DLLs makes this batch highly suspicious. It fits the profile of an attack where an adversary is establishing persistence and possibly dropping malicious code on the system. The repetitive nature of creating these tasks further supports the idea that this isn't accidental but a deliberate action.\n\nI'm pretty confident that this batch indicates malicious behavior, so I'd classify it as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks created by PowerShell scripts targeting elevated privileges and system components indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, several entries are from powershell.exe loading images and creating files. Notably, there's a file being created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. This is suspicious because temporary script files can be used for malicious activities. Moreover, the file is deleted shortly after, which might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, I see two events where powershell.exe is executing a command that creates scheduled tasks. The commands are trying to run calc.exe at logon with high privileges. This is concerning because it suggests someone is trying to create persistent malware that runs on user logon, often a tactic used in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where the process command line isn't specified for some entries, which could mean something was hidden or obfuscated. Also, multiple registry writes from chrome.exe are logged. While chrome can make registry changes normally, doing so repeatedly might be worth investigating if it's outside usual behavior.\n\nThe latter half of the logs show several \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks without any process information. This is alarming because executing remote commands without clear context could indicate unauthorized access or command-and-control activities. The repetition of these events suggests persistent attempts to execute commands remotely, which raises security concerns.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of potentially malicious activity involving powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks and hiding processes, along with multiple remote command executions. These indicators suggest a possible breach or attack attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including Powershell script execution attempts, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, scheduled task creations with calc.exe at logon, and repeated remote command executions. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything unusual.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object. The fields include process name, winlog task, and file path. I'll start by listing out all the events to get an overview.\n\n1. **WmiPrvSE.exe** loaded taskschd.dll. That seems normal since WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation.\n2. svchost.exe set a registry value multiple times—three times in a row. I know svchost can be malicious, but it's also a legitimate process for services. Without more context, this might just be normal activity.\n3. Another svchost.exe creating a file: C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. That path looks suspicious because \"unidade_comum\" translates to \"common unit,\" which doesn't ring a bell as a standard system folder. It's in the Tasks directory, but why would svchost create a new file there? Maybe it's trying to schedule a task.\n4. Next event has no process name, just an execute remote command action. That sounds concerning because executing commands remotely without proper context could indicate malicious activity. I need to pay attention here.\n5. **Powershell.exe** created a file in the user's AppData folder under a specific path. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks, so this could be suspicious, especially if it's creating files in non-standard locations.\n6. Again, powershell.exe setting a registry value—another red flag. Registry modifications are often part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n7. **Conhost.exe** also set a registry value. Conhost is usually related to command-line processing; I'm not sure why it would modify the registry here.\n8. **Chrome.exe** setting registry values multiple times, which seems unusual because Chrome shouldn't be modifying system-wide registry settings. This could indicate tampering or malicious activity.\n9. Chrome loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory. That might just be a legitimate action since it's part of the platform files, but I'm not entirely sure if this is normal.\n10. **Winlogbeat.exe** creating a file in its own directory—seems okay if winlogbeat is running as intended, perhaps for log file rotation.\n11. Powershell again creating another file in the user's Downloads folder: entrada_principal.txt. This could be part of data exfiltration or storing malicious scripts.\n12. Multiple more Chrome.exe events setting registry values—eight instances. This repetition makes me think something is off because legitimate processes usually don't do this repeatedly.\n13. Finally, a DNS query from Chrome and another powershell file creation.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are:\n- **svchost.exe** creating a file in an unusual location.\n- Multiple **Registry value set** tasks by various processes, especially svchost and chrome which aren't typically doing that.\n- Powershell.exe creating files in non-standard locations like AppData and Downloads.\n- The remote command execution event is a big red flag.\n\nThese activities could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms, file creation for payload storage, or unauthorized access. The combination of these events makes the batch interesting for investigation because they don't seem to be normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including svchost.exe creating a file in an unusual location, powershell.exe creating files in non-standard paths, and repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe which are concerning signs of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
