{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does need to connect to the internet for browsing and look up domains. I don't see any red flags here yet.\n\nNext, there's a process named powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. Powershell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so this catches my attention. The command lines in some of these events are more detailed. For example, one event shows a complex command line with paths like \"C:\\modulo_logico\\registro_base\\\" which I'm not familiar with. The fact that it's modifying LastWriteTimes to 01\/01\/1970 seems suspicious because that date is often used in file tampering or creating hidden files.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr*.dll. This could be normal if Powershell is running scripts that require .NET components, but combined with the previous activity, it raises a concern about potential code injection or execution of malicious scripts.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted in the same process. The path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1\". Temporary files are common, but the fact that it's created and deleted within the same session might be an attempt to avoid detection or leave less trace.\n\nAnother event shows a pipe being created by powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other activities, it could indicate a way to hide malicious behavior or exfiltrate data.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value set events from powershell.exe and another process RuntimeBroker.exe. Modifying registry values is common in legitimate software installations, but again, when combined with other suspicious activities like file manipulation and network connections, it increases the concern.\n\nI also notice that some of the command lines in the powershell.exe processes involve changing LastWriteTimes on multiple files across different directories. This activity stands out because attackers often manipulate timestamps to bypass certain security checks or to hide their tracks by making files appear older or newer than they are.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows a series of actions that could be part of legitimate script execution but also exhibit behaviors typical of malicious activities such as file tampering, registry modifications, and attempts to cover tracks. While it's not conclusive evidence of an attack, there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including Powershell command-line operations modifying file timestamps across different directories, network connections, and file creation\/deletion patterns indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, the initial events are from PowerShell processes. The command lines look like they're using Get-ChildItem on various file paths and then modifying the LastWriteTime to a date in 1970. That seems suspicious because changing timestamps is often a sign of tampering or trying to hide activity. These commands could be part of an attempt to cover tracks by altering file metadata.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, most of these PowerShell events are under tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. Those tasks don't immediately raise red flags, but the combination with modifying file times is concerning. Also, multiple similar commands across different paths might indicate a pattern or script running, which could be malicious.\n\nThen there's an event from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is commonly used by system services, so it's not inherently suspicious, but unusual activities from it can be. The fact that two events show registry changes here adds to the potential concern.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll. While Calculator is a benign app, loading URL-related DLLs could hint at some unexpected behavior, like an embedded script or potential file operations.\n\nAnother PowerShell event shows ImageLoad for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's normal since Defender uses such modules, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are several events where processes (like winlogbeat.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe) perform file creations or registry modifications. These could be legitimate actions if these are known good processes, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe batch also has multiple RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe. While Chrome is a common browser, repeated registry writes can indicate extensions or scripts modifying system settings, which might be suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting this all together: the recurring PowerShell commands changing file times across different files, combined with other process activities like svchost and Calculator making changes, could signal malicious activity. The use of multiple processes and repeated actions might indicate a script or tool trying to maintain persistence or hide its tracks. While some events aren't overtly suspicious on their own, the cluster of potentially manipulative actions across different processes suggests a higher likelihood of something being amiss.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to modify file timestamps and interact with system components, suggesting potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: Chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll from C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll. That seems normal because amsi is part of Windows and handles anti-malware scanning. No red flags here.\n\nSecond event: Chrome.exe set a registry value. Not sure which one, but it's possible Chrome makes changes to the registry for settings or extensions. I don't see anything suspicious yet.\n\nThird event: Winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own directory with .winlogbeat.yml.new. That sounds like part of its configuration process. Probably nothing wrong here.\n\nFourth event: Powershell.exe created a file named unidade_logico.txt in the user's downloads folder. Powershell is often used by attackers, but creating a file isn't suspicious on its own unless it's related to malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the next five events: All are Chrome.exe setting registry values again. This repetition might be a bit odd because why would Chrome set so many registry changes? Maybe it's installing multiple extensions or making several configuration tweaks. That could be normal, but excessive registry writes can sometimes indicate something more nefarious like persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: There are a few things to note. First, the repeated registry writes by Chrome.exe might be worth looking into. Even though each event itself isn't suspicious, multiple similar events in a short time span could suggest an issue. Also, the use of Powershell.exe is often a red flag because it's a common tool for attackers.\n\nSo overall, while individually these events seem benign or just normal system activity, the combination—especially the multiple registry changes and the use of Powershell—could be signs of potential malicious behavior. This batch should probably be classified as interesting for further investigation to ensure there's no underlying threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Chrome.exe modifying registry values and the creation of a file by Powershell.exe in user downloads suggest potential malicious activity or unusual behavior warranting investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
