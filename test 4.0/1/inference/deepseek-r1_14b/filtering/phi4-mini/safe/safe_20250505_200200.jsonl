{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Each event is a JSON object with details about processes, Windows logs, and file information. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few events: there's winlogbeat.exe creating files, powershell.exe accessing processes, and ssh.exe making network connections. These seem pretty normal. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so its activities are expected. SSH could be legitimate if it's part of remote access setup.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Powershell often uses these for execution, but doing this repeatedly might be a red flag. Also, there's a file created by powershell in the Temp directory with a random name __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1. This looks suspicious because it's creating a script file in an unusual location without a clear reason.\n\nThen there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe. These might be part of normal operations, but combined with the other actions, they could indicate something fishy. The pipe creation event is another point to note—powershell often uses pipes for communication, which can be malicious if not explained.\n\nThe last entry shows svchost.exe creating a file in an Xbox Live directory. Svchost is a common process that's part of Windows services, so this might be normal unless there's an unusual pattern or other signs of compromise.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances doing various actions, including loading unexpected DLLs and creating temporary scripts—this could indicate script injection or malicious activity. The repeated provider events and pipe creation also add to the suspicion. While not all events are necessarily bad on their own, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe loading DLLs and creating a script file in Temp directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
