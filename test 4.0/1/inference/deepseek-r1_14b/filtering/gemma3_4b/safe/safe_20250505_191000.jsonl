Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems normal because these are common system files. Then there are a couple of User Account Management events without any process info, which might be related to user logon\/logoff activitiesâ€”nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, I see \"rundll32.exe\" being used with a command line that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. Rundll32 is commonly used for running DLL functions, but the presence of a specific GUID could be a concern if it's associated with known malicious activities. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are several events from \"svchost.exe\" modifying registry values. Svchost is part of Windows services and often legitimate, so unless there's an unusual service name or behavior, this might not be suspicious. \n\nThe \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in its own directory looks like it's part of the log shipping process, which is expected behavior if Winlogbeat is installed on this system. So that's probably normal.\n\nExcel.exe launching and loading various DLLs is typical when opening files or accessing external data. The fact that it's loading several system DLLs isn't unusual unless there's an attempt to load malicious ones, but none of these seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where \"EXCEL.EXE\" loads different system DLLs, which again aligns with normal Excel operations, especially when dealing with data parsing or external libraries. \n\n\"WmiPrvSE.exe\" is another common process related to WMI services. Its command line and loaded DLL seem standard for its operation.\n\nThe events from \"services.exe\" and the logon-related tasks don't raise any red flags either; they're typical system processes.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, most of these events are normal system operations or legitimate application behaviors. There's no evidence of unusual file accesses, network communications, or known malicious process spawns. While there's a rundll32 call with a GUID, without additional context indicating malicious activity associated with that GUID, it's not enough to classify the batch as interesting.\n\nTherefore, considering all events together, I don't see sufficient indicators of malicious behavior. The batch doesn't warrant further investigation beyond routine monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system operations and legitimate application behaviors without signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are five events where the task is \"User Account Management.\" These are often related to user login or account changes. However, without specific details like success\/failure codes or account names, it's hard to tell if they're suspicious. They could just be normal user activity.\n\nThen, I notice an Excel process starting up. EXCEL.EXE is a common application, so that's not unusual on its own. But let's dig deeper into the events associated with this process.\n\nThe next event mentions \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" for coml2.dll in System32. This DLL could be part of legitimate Windows operations or might be malicious if it's a known exploit. I'm not sure yet, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nFollowing that, there are multiple DNS query events from Excel. Repeated DNS queries can sometimes indicate data exfiltration or communication with external servers. But again, Excel does make legitimate DNS calls when accessing online resources, so this isn't conclusive.\n\nLooking at the file events, Excel creates a shortcut to real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder. This seems like standard behavior for an application trying to access or save files. It doesn't raise any red flags unless the file path is pointing to something unusual.\n\nPutting it all together: There's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The events seem consistent with a user opening Excel and interacting normally, possibly saving or accessing files, and making necessary DNS queries. The repeated User Account Management tasks could be part of the system logging in or out users, which is routine.\n\nI don't see any unusual file accesses, failed logins, or other signs that would suggest this batch is suspicious. Therefore, I classify it as \"NOT INTERESTING.\"\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal user account management and Excel processes without indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
