Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems pretty normal; it's a standard tool used to identify the user. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye on how it's being used here. The command line in the fourth event is interesting: it's using findstr to search for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc., and then using select-string with a pattern for \"password\". That sounds like someone is trying to look for password information.\n\nLooking at the subsequent events, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware, so that's another red flag.\n\nThen, I notice several Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various .NET and native images. While this is normal for Powershell scripts to load these components, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me cautious.\n\nThe file creation and deletion in the temp directory is concerning. Creating a script test file and then deleting it might be an attempt to avoid detection or part of some malicious payload execution process.\n\nThere are also multiple Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe, which could indicate that it's being used as part of a larger script or module loading process. The repeated command lines with the findstr and select-string commands suggest automation or script execution, possibly searching for sensitive information.\n\nPutting all this together: the batch shows multiple actions by Powershell that are indicative of potential data exfiltration or credential harvesting. The repeated patterns in command lines and file operations are signs that something malicious might be happening.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command-line arguments searching for sensitive information, along with attempts to create and delete files, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see several entries where the process is powershell.exe with a specific command line that includes searching for \"pass\" in various file types. That command looks like it's trying to find sensitive information, which could be malicious. PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities and how it can execute commands without being easily detected.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where svchost.exe is involved with registry changes. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but when it's making registry modifications, especially without clear justification, it might be suspicious. Attackers sometimes use svchost as a hiding spot for their malicious activities.\n\nI also notice that conhost.exe and other system-related processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe are modifying the registry. While these are standard system processes, any unexpected registry changes could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms set by malware.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity from OfficeClickToRun.exe making DNS queries. Although this might seem normal for software updates or checking licenses, it could also be a way for malicious code to communicate with command and control servers.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but I can see that many of these events involve registry modifications, process creations, and file accesses without clear context. This kind of activity is often seen during an attack where an adversary is establishing persistence or attempting to cover their tracks.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious commands, along with multiple system processes making unusual changes, raises red flags. These could be indicators of a possible breach or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including potential credential harvesting using powershell.exe and registry modifications by various processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, a lot of them are from chrome.exe performing various tasks. There are multiple entries where chrome.exe sets registry values. That seems normal because Chrome might be adjusting settings during operation.\n\nThen there are DNS queries and network connections detected. Again, these could be part of standard browsing activity. Chrome would need to resolve domain names and establish connections to websites, so this isn't unusual on its own.\n\nThere's one event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so it's expected for it to create or update configuration files. That doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nAnother event involves powershell.exe creating a new file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. Powershell can be used maliciously, but it's also commonly used for legitimate tasks like script execution. The filename doesn't suggest anything harmful immediately, but I should consider whether the creation of this file is part of normal operations or could indicate something suspicious.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are multiple events, none of them by themselves indicate malicious behavior. Chrome's actions and winlogbeat creating files are typical. The powershell.exe event is a bit more notable, but without additional context like unusual command-line arguments or file content analysis, it's hard to say if it's suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear indication of malicious activity when looking at the entire set.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist primarily of normal user activities such as Chrome setting registry values, DNS queries, network connections, and Winlogbeat creating log files.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously, so I should keep an eye on that. Then, there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be related to log shipping or monitoringâ€”seems benign, but could be part of some larger activity.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run from the system32 directory, which is normal for such utilities, but it's worth noting as sometimes info gathering tools are used early in attacks. There are several instances where powershell.exe accesses processes, which could indicate script execution or lateral movement if combined with other actions.\n\nLooking further, cmd.exe is used to delete scheduled tasks using schtasks. This is a bit concerning because deleting tasks without proper authorization can be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. The command lines show specific task names being deleted, which might suggest targeted removal of certain tasks, possibly malicious ones.\n\nThere are multiple instances where svchost.exe interacts with the registry. Svchost is a legitimate process but often used by malware to hide activities. Registry changes could indicate installation or removal of software components, so this might be worth investigating further.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. Notepad isn't typically malicious, but deleting processes via wmic can be a way to cover tracks or disrupt operations. This adds to the suspicion that something is amiss.\n\nConhost.exe modifying registry values is another red flag. Conhost is associated with console windows and might not have direct malicious uses on its own, but any unexpected registry changes could indicate tampering.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several signs of process creation, deletion of scheduled tasks, powershell activity, and registry modifications. These activities don't necessarily point to a confirmed breach yet, but they do show behavior that's worth looking into more closely. The confidence level is moderate because while the actions could be malicious, they might also be part of legitimate system administration or cleanup processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation and deletion, powershell.exe activity, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to process creation and deletion. For example, WMIC.exe is used with commands like deleting notepad.exe. That's a bit concerning because using administrative tools like WMIC for process deletion can be legitimate but might also indicate malicious activity. It depends on the context, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe entries, both for ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks. Powershell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and persistence. The fact that it's accessed multiple times without clear justification could raise a red flag. However, it's also widely used legitimately, so I can't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLooking further, there are commands like net.exe and cmd.exe with user deletion commands. Specifically, 'net user \/del' suggests someone is trying to delete user accounts. If these aren't authorized actions, that could be malicious. But again, it's possible for admins to perform such tasks during cleanup or account management.\n\nThere are also entries where conhost.exe and whoami.exe are used. Conhost is often related to PowerShell and can be used in attacks for persistence or as part of a malicious script execution. Whoami.exe is typically benign but could be misused to gather system information for later attacks.\n\nThe last few events don't have process or file info, just user account management and security group changes. These alone might not indicate anything suspicious, but when combined with the other entries, they add to the overall context.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accesses, WMIC commands deleting processes, net.exe deleting users, and tools like conhost and whoami being used. This combination looks like a potential attack chain. It could be someone trying to escalate privileges, delete accounts (maybe to cover their tracks), or establish persistence using Powershell.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern suggests possible malicious activity rather than normal system operations. The confidence is high but not certain since some of these commands can be part of legitimate admin tasks. However, the volume and combination make it more likely to be suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity including process deletions, user account management with net.exe, and powershell.exe accesses, suggesting a possible attack chain.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a bunch of log events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: It's a user account management task. That could be normal admin work, like creating or deleting users.\n\nSecond event: PowerShell is being used, specifically setting a registry value. Not sure if that's bad yet, but it's something to note.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe running a command to delete a user from the domain. The command line shows \"\/del \/domain\". That seems suspicious because deleting a user via command prompt could be part of an attack.\n\nFourth and fifth events: More PowerShell activity and another registry change. Still not conclusive, but combined with previous events, it's getting concerning.\n\nSixth event: net.exe used to delete another admin account. This is similar to the third event, suggesting repeated attempts to remove users.\n\nSeventh event: net1.exe deleting a user. I'm not familiar with net1.exe; maybe it's a typo or a different tool. Either way, another deletion attempt.\n\nEighth and ninth events: cmd.exe and conhost.exe making registry changes. These could be part of setting up persistence for malware or trying to hide traces.\n\nTenth through twelfth events: More PowerShell accesses and registry modifications. This repetition makes me think someone is trying to do something malicious with elevated privileges.\n\nThirteenth event: cmd.exe deleting a service (sc delete). Deleting services can disrupt system operations, which might be part of an attack.\n\nFourteenth and fifteenth events: sc.exe and services.exe making changes. These are legitimate system tools but used here in ways that don't seem standard. Services.exe modifying registry could be for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nSixteenth event: cmd.exe again with another registry change. The pattern continues, so maybe it's an automated script trying to remove users and disable services.\n\nSeventeenth event: whoami.exe run without arguments. This is often used by attackers to check the current user context. If it's part of a larger sequence, it could be for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are multiple attempts to delete admin accounts using various tools (cmd.exe, net.exe, net1.exe), repeated registry modifications which might be covering tracks, and use of PowerShell and whoami.exe which can be signs of malicious activity. The combination suggests a potential attack where someone is trying to remove user accounts possibly to erase evidence or gain unauthorized access.\n\nI'm pretty confident that this batch is interesting because it shows several red flags: multiple deletions of admin accounts, unusual tool usage, registry edits, and process accesses. These activities together are more concerning than isolated events.

The user is a cybersecurity expert looking at system logs to spot malicious activities. They provided a batch of events in JSONL format and want me to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: cmd.exe is deleting files in the temp directory. This could be suspicious because deleting temporary files might be part of malicious activity to cover tracks.\n2. **Event 2**: powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, so this alone isn't conclusive but raises an eyebrow.\n3. **Event 3**: cmd.exe modifying the registry. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're not part of normal operations.\n4. **Event 4**: cmd.exe deleting a specific file in Temp. The filename seems encoded or related to some calculation, which might indicate it's part of malicious scripts trying to erase evidence.\n5. **Events 5-7**: More cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities without files involved. These could be normal operations but combined with others, they become more concerning.\n6. **Event 8**: whoami.exe is run, which typically retrieves user information. While innocent on its own, it's often used by attackers to gather system details.\n7. **Events 9-15**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed, along with provider and engine lifecycle events. This could indicate script execution or attempts to load malicious modules.\n8. **Events 16-20**: Powershell.exe loading various .NET files. While normal for PowerShell's operation, the volume might suggest something is amiss.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple cmd.exe processes deleting files and modifying the registry, which could be signs of a script trying to clean up after itself or modify system configurations. The extensive use of powershell.exe, especially with provider lifecycle events, suggests potential scripting activityâ€”either legitimate admin work or malicious code execution.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of file deletions, registry modifications, and excessive PowerShell usage could indicate malicious behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The confidence isn't too high (maybe 0.6) because while these activities are suspicious, they might also be part of a legitimate script or routine system maintenance.\n\nSo, the batch is worth investigating further, but there's no concrete evidence yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory and modifying registry values, which could indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. First off, I'm noticing a lot of PowerShell activity. The user is running `powershell.exe` multiple times with different command lines and file operations.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's an ImageLoad for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate since it's part of Microsoft Defender. But then, a FileCreate event creates a temp script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. The fact that it's created and then immediately deleted in the next event makes me suspicious. Why create a script only to delete it? Maybe it's trying to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself.\n\nNext, there are several Registry value sets and Process accesses related to PowerShell. These could be normal operations, but paired with the temp file activity, they might indicate some scripting or persistence mechanisms being established.\n\nI see `whoami.exe` is executed a few times. That's typically used to check user permissions or gather information about the current user. While not inherently malicious on its own, repeated use without a clear purpose could be part of reconnaissance activities.\n\nThere are also instances where winlogbeat.exe creates files in its data directory. That seems like it's just logging and shouldn't raise flags unless there's something wrong with how it's being used.\n\nConsidering the overall patternâ€”repeated PowerShell executions, temp file creation\/deletion, registry modificationsâ€”it looks like someone is testing or attempting to run scripts that might be malicious. The frequent use of ProcessAccess events on PowerShell could indicate attempts to inject code or manipulate processes, which are common in malware behavior.\n\nWhile some activities could be benign, the combination points towards potential malicious intent. There's also a possible persistence mechanism with the script file and registry changes, which is a red flag for long-term compromise attempts.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of the suspicious patterns, but I need to balance that with not jumping to conclusions without more evidence. The confidence level is medium since while there are signs, they could be part of legitimate system administration tasks or automated processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, along with repeated whoami.exe executions, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually and then see if there's a pattern or something unusual when considering all of them together.\n\n1. **whoami.exe**: This process is typically used to determine the user's identity. Running it without any flags seems normal unless it's part of a larger activity. It appears twice in the logs, which might just be regular usage.\n\n2. **powershell.exe**: PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious since it has powerful scripting capabilities. The events show 'Process accessed' tasks, which could mean scripts are being run or modules loaded. However, without seeing actual command execution or evidence of malicious script content, this alone isn't conclusive.\n\n3. **RuntimeBroker.exe** and **svchost.exe**: These are both known to be legitimate Windows processes. RuntimeBroker handles background tasks, and svchost is a common host process for various services. Their activity here doesn't raise flags unless they're doing something outside their usual operations.\n\n4. **notepad.exe**: Simple text editor used here. The event mentions registry changes, which could be part of configuration but seems normal unless it's modifying sensitive areas without reason.\n\n5. **calc.exe** and **Calculator.exe**: These are standard system tools. Their activity with URLMON.DLL loading is interesting because that DLL handles URL parsing. It might indicate they're accessing or processing URLs, possibly fetching something from the internet. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\n6. **winlogbeat.exe**: This is likely an agent for log management, creating files as part of its operation. The file path seems legitimate, so no red flags here.\n\n7. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe** and **chrome.exe**: These are standard processes for the application framework and the Chrome browser respectively. Their activities like registry changes and DNS queries are within expected behavior unless there's unusual frequency or destinations, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nLooking at all events together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. Most processes are standard system tools or legitimate applications. While PowerShell is a higher-risk process, there's no evidence in these logs of it executing commands that would indicate malicious behavior, like downloading files or accessing restricted areas.\n\nThe repeated registry changes by svchost and other processes might seem suspicious, but they could just be normal operations, especially if they're part of system updates or legitimate software installations. The DNS queries from Chrome are also common for a browser accessing websites.\n\nWithout any events showing failed attempts, known malicious file paths, or unusual behavior like writing to unexpected locations, this batch doesn't seem concerning. Therefore, it's probably not interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system processes and activities without evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
