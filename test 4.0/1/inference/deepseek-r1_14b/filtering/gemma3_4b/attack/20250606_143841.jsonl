{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I see a lot of PowerShell processes here. That's already a bit concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is accessing files and registry values. For example, there's an event where it creates a file in the Temp directory, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1. Then, just after creating it, it deletes that same file. That seems odd—why create and then immediately delete a script? Maybe trying to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those might be normal for PowerShell execution, but the combination with other activities could indicate something's up.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'whoami.exe' being spawned by PowerShell. I'm not sure if that's part of legitimate activity or if it's trying to gather system information as a precursor to an attack.\n\nThere are a few RegistryEvent tasks where PowerShell accesses or modifies registry values. That can be tricky because it's possible but might also be a sign of persistence mechanisms, like adding registry keys to run malicious scripts on startup.\n\nThe command line for one of the PowerShell processes looks a bit suspicious: \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". That seems like it's trying to create a new drive mapping to another system (maybe a remote machine) using G:. This could be an attempt to access files on another computer, which is something an attacker might do during lateral movement in a network.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell activities, file creation\/deletion, registry accesses, and the command-line arguments suggest possible malicious behavior.

My goal is to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. It can execute scripts, access the registry, create files, and more. So any unusual activity with it could be red flags.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. There's a pattern of 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe. This might indicate that the process is being monitored or perhaps there's some interaction happening with it.\n2. There are several instances where powershell.exe creates temporary files, like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1'. Temporary script files can be a sign of testing or potentially malicious scripts trying to bypass certain policies.\n3. I see a file creation and then deletion of that same temporary PowerShell script. This might suggest an attempt to test if the script is allowed, possibly trying to create and delete it without being detected, which could be part of a larger attack strategy.\n4. There's also a 'File Delete logged' event for the created script. This could indicate either cleanup after testing or maybe even an attempt to remove evidence, though in this case, since it's logged, it might not be effective at hiding.\n5. Registry access and image loading events are present. These can be normal for PowerShell scripts, but combined with other actions, they might be suspicious. Malware often uses legitimate tools like PowerShell to hide its activities.\n6. The creation of a startup profile data file in the user's AppData directory is another point to consider. This could allow an attacker to persistence, where malicious code is run at each login or startup.\n\nOn the other hand, some events might not be suspicious on their own, like the use of cmd.exe or whoami.exe. These are common utilities and often used in scripts for various purposes. The 'Process Create' tasks don't necessarily indicate malicious activity unless they're part of a chain of suspicious events.\n\nHowever, considering all these events together: multiple powershell instances, temporary file creation\/deletion, registry interactions, image loading, and startup profile modifications – this combination seems concerning. It suggests possible scripting or automated processes that could be testing system boundaries or attempting to hide activities.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of behaviors points to potential malicious activity, even if individual events aren't suspicious on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with file creation\/deletion and registry access suggest potential malicious activity or testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. That's a common tool but can be used maliciously. The tasks include Registry value sets, Process accesses, and Image loads. These actions could indicate legitimate activity or potentially suspicious behavior because scripts often interact with the registry and load various modules.\n\nI see several \"RegistryEvent\" tasks where PowerShell is setting registry values. This is concerning because attackers often modify the registry to persistence their malware. Then there are multiple instances of \"ProcessAccess\" which might be exploring other processes, another red flag. The \"ImageLoad\" events loading different DLLs could be part of normal operations, but some like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll are related to .NET runtime, which is typical for PowerShell scripts.\n\nThere's also a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1. The script is created and then deleted quickly, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by security tools. This behavior raises suspicion because attackers might use such techniques to test malicious scripts or delete evidence after execution.\n\nAdditionally, there's a \"FileCreate\" event in the PowerShell StartupProfileData folder, which could be part of legitimate scripting but could also be used for persistence if the script runs on startup.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry modifications, process accesses, quick file creation and deletion by PowerShell. These behaviors are often indicative of malicious activities, such as script testing or establishing persistence. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications, process access, and file operations in the Temp directory, suggest potential malicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities like executing scripts or command-line tools. \n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events: \"& {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This script checks if a specific file exists. If it does, it exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. That's unusual behavior because typically, scripts would do more than just an exit check unless they're trying to avoid detection or set up some conditional logic for further actions.\n\nThere are also several ImageLoad events from different DLL files when powershell.exe runs. This is normal as PowerShell loads various components, but the combination of multiple such events along with file creation and deletion might indicate that it's executing a script that modifies the system.\n\nAnother event shows a FileCreate action by svchost.exe creating a specific key-value file. Svchost.exe is typically associated with legitimate services, but sometimes malware can abuse it. This particular path seems arbitrary and possibly used for storing malicious configurations or data.\n\nThe fact that powershell.exe creates a temporary script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1), then immediately deletes it suggests an attempt to avoid detection. Malicious scripts often delete their traces after execution, so this behavior is suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell.exe activity with checks for specific files, creation and deletion of temporary files, and unusual registry or file operations. These patterns are consistent with potential malicious activities like script execution, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including file checks, creation\/deletion of temporary files, and image loads suggest potential malicious behavior such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. One stands out where it's loading MpClient.dll from a Windows Defender directory. That's suspicious because legitimate scripts usually don't need to load DLLs like that. Then, another event shows a file being created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. Creating files here could be a sign of persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there are several Registry-related tasks from powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities, especially if they're setting or deleting values without clear justification. The repeated registry events with different types (value set, object added\/deleted) suggest someone is trying to cover their tracks or modify system configurations.\n\nLooking further down, there are process creations for whoami.exe and cmd.exe. Using whoami to check user privileges is common but when combined with other suspicious activities, it raises a red flag. The cmd.exe command runs \"netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\", which disables Windows Firewall. That's a classic indicator of malicious activity because attackers often disable firewalls to establish persistence.\n\nAnother process creation for netsh.exe directly modifying the firewall settings again points towards an attacker trying to turn it off, ensuring no network-level protection. The svchost.exe processes are making multiple registry changes, which could be part of installing a backdoor or altering system behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell and cmd usage with netsh, combined with registry modifications, file creations in non-standard locations, and disabling security features like the firewall—these are strong signs of potential malicious activity. The consistent use of legitimate tools for illegitimate purposes is a common tactic in cyberattacks to avoid detection.\n\nSo, considering all these events collectively, it's clear there's some suspicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including Powershell executions, file creations, registry modifications, and disabling of firewall through netsh.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, all the events are similar. Each one has \"svchost.exe\" as the process name. I remember that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by services, so by itself, it's not malicious. But sometimes malware can hide under this name because it's common and gets less scrutiny.\n\nEach event also mentions a windows log task: 'Registry object added or deleted'. That means something in the registry was changed. Registry modifications are common for legitimate software installations or configuration changes, but they're also a red flag for malware since attackers often drop persistence mechanisms there.\n\nNow, considering each individual event might not be suspicious, but seeing so many of them together could raise an eyebrow. Why is svchost.exe making multiple registry changes? Legitimate processes usually don't do that unless something's wrong or it's part of a bulk update.\n\nBut wait, there are 25 events here. That seems like a lot. I wonder if this is normal behavior for the system. If multiple services were being updated at once, maybe, but 25 instances of registry changes from svchost.exe feels unusual. It could indicate some kind of script or tool running multiple commands.\n\nI also notice that none of the events have file information—probably because they're focused on process and registry activity. So if this were a real attack, it's possible they're trying to avoid detection by using common processes and only modifying the registry.\n\nPutting it all together, while each event alone isn't alarming, the volume and repetition might suggest something more is going on. Maybe an attacker is testing the system or deploying malicious software that's making multiple changes without a clear purpose. Or perhaps it's a legitimate process gone rogue, but without more context, I can't be certain.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, this batch is definitely worth looking into further. The repetition and high number of events make me confident enough to classify them as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe could indicate malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

The associated task is about registry changes, which isn't inherently suspicious but can be if it's happening unusually or in combination with other actions.\n\nThen there are several events where the command line points to powershell.exe executing a script that creates a new PS drive mapped to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". This caught my attention because using Powershell for administrative tasks is common, but creating a remote drive like this might indicate potential malicious activity. Especially if \"Target\" isn't a recognized or legitimate hostname in the environment.\n\nLooking further, these powershell.exe events have different winlog tasks: some are 'Provider Lifecycle' and one is 'Engine Lifecycle'. This variety might suggest different stages of script execution, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of registry modifications followed by Powershell commands that attempt to interact with remote systems. These behaviors could be indicators of potential malicious activity, such as setting up a backdoor or lateral movement within a network.

Each event is in JSONL format with process, winlog, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all involve powershell.exe being executed. The command lines are either empty or contain some PowerShell commands. The tasks under winlog vary between 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'.\n\nThe initial events show a mix of Provider and Engine Lifecycle tasks. Then, towards the middle, there's a change in the command line: it starts checking if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a specific path. This is interesting because procdump is often used for dumping process memory, which can be malicious.\n\nI notice that after this point, multiple events repeat the same command checking for procdump.exe. This repetition could indicate an attempt to verify or ensure the presence of procdump.exe, possibly before using it in a larger script or payload.\n\nThe fact that the majority of these events are from powershell.exe and involve either establishing drives (like creating a G:\\ drive pointing to \\\\Target\\C$) or checking for specific files suggests potential malicious activity. Such behavior could be part of an attack chain, like initial access or lateral movement.\n\nWhile individual events might not seem suspicious on their own, the combination—especially multiple checks for procdump.exe and the earlier attempt to create a network drive—raises concerns.

The script checks if a file named procdump.exe exists in a specific path, exits with 0 if it does, else 1. The winlog task is 'Engine Lifecycle'.\n\nI know that checking for the existence of files can be part of malicious activity to ensure certain tools are present before proceeding. If this script is running multiple times or across different systems, it might indicate an attempt to spread malware or prepare for further actions.\n\nSince both events are identical, they might be part of a larger campaign. It's possible that this is reconnaissance, where the attacker is verifying if procdump.exe is present, perhaps to dump process memory or extract information. The use of a specific path and the fact that it's using powershell suggests it could be evading detection.\n\nGiven all this, there's a reasonable chance this activity is malicious.
