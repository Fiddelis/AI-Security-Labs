{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries where 'chrome.exe' is involved. The tasks associated with these are Dns query and Network connection detected. While Chrome doing DNS queries and connecting to networks isn't unusual, especially for a browser, repeated network connections might be worth looking into if they're not related to legitimate browsing activity.\n\nThen, the events switch to 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but also frequently abused by attackers for command-line execution and script running. The first event with powershell shows a Process Create task. That's normal when starting a new process. But what catches my attention is the command line argument in one of the events where it's using Powershell to perform some operations, including XOR encoding.\n\nWait, that part looks suspicious. The command line has a script that encodes something using XOR with a key and then sends it via an HTTP POST request. XOR encoding isn't very sophisticated, but its use here could indicate an attempt to obfuscate data being sent out, possibly exfiltrating information. That's a red flag because data exfiltration is often part of an attack chain—like stealing credentials or sensitive info.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple Process Access and Registry value set events for powershell.exe. Accessing the registry can be normal for certain operations, but combined with other activities, it might indicate malicious behavior. The Image Load events for various DLLs in Powershell's process could be part of legitimate operations, especially since they're related to .NET framework components, which Powershell relies on.\n\nThe File Create and Delete events are interesting too. The script creates a temporary file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1 and then deletes it. Temporary files created and immediately deleted might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace on the filesystem, which is common in malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of Powershell executing a script with XOR encoding for data transmission, creating and deleting temporary files, and accessing system components (registry, images). These behaviors are not typical user activity. They point towards potential malicious code execution, possibly part of an attack or unauthorized access attempt.\n\nI'm also noting that while Chrome's activities might seem normal, the combination of Powershell's actions could be indicative of a broader attack vector where an initial compromise is being weaponized. The fact that this batch has several events tied to Powershell with concerning command-line arguments and file operations makes me lean towards classifying it as interesting.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors—suspicious script execution, data encoding for exfiltration, temporary file handling—the overall pattern suggests malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including XOR encoding of plaintext to create ciphertext, creating and deleting a temporary PowerShell script file, and accessing system components.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let me see what each event is showing.\n\nThe first event has a process named powershell.exe and the Windows log task says \"Pipe Created\". That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for scripting, including malicious activities. A pipe created might mean some form of communication or maybe persistence.\n\nLooking at the next few events, they all have similar command lines in PowerShell. Each one is executing a script that encodes some plaintext using XOR encryption with a simple key. The plaintext includes a path and a username, which seems suspicious because it's including user-specific info like \"C:\\Users\\ victim\". Then it sends this encrypted data via an HTTP POST request to example.com.\n\nI notice that the same command line appears multiple times across several events. That repetition could indicate automated activity or part of a larger script execution, maybe even a loop. The use of XOR cipher isn't very sophisticated and might be an attempt to obscure data being sent out, which is a common tactic in exfiltration activities.\n\nAlso, the URL example.com is hardcoded. If this were legitimate, I'd expect it to point to a specific server or service, but example.com is a generic domain, often used in examples, so that raises suspicion. The POST method sending the cyphertext suggests data is being sent out, possibly exfiltrating information.\n\nThe process events are all powershell.exe with similar command lines, which could be part of a script trying to execute multiple times or different instances of the same malicious activity. Multiple occurrences might indicate an attempt to bypass detection by spreading the traffic across several requests.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated use of PowerShell to encode and send data to a suspicious domain. This looks like possible data exfiltration, which is a key indicator of potential malicious activity. The encryption with a simple XOR cipher is a red flag for obfuscation techniques used in attacks.\n\nSo, the batch as a whole shows signs that could be related to malicious behavior. The combination of using powershell.exe, XOR encoding, sending data to an unusual domain, and repeated events makes it interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing a script that performs XOR encryption on user-specific information and sends it via HTTP POST to example.com.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve encoding plaintext into ciphertext using XOR encryption. The key here is \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\", which seems a bit simplistic. This suggests some sort of data obfuscation or perhaps an attempt to hide information before sending it over the network, as there's an Invoke-WebRequest call to example.com. That immediately raises a red flag because unusual PowerShell activity, especially involving encryption and external web requests, can be indicative of malicious behavior.\n\nLooking further, I notice multiple events where powershell.exe is loading different DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While these are legitimate Windows files, the repeated loading could indicate that the script is trying to establish persistence or interact with various system components in a way that's not typical for standard usage.\n\nThere are also several registry value sets by processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and others. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities, such as creating persistent backdoors or altering system configurations to maintain access. The fact that multiple processes are making these changes adds to the suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, there's a DNS query event for an external domain (example.com). While this could be normal web traffic, coupled with the other events, it might indicate that the malicious script is attempting to communicate with a command-and-control server or exfiltrate data.\n\nI also see entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, but in some cases, especially if it's part of an attack chain, it could be involved in moving logs (potentially containing sensitive information) to an external location. The fact that the same file path is referenced twice makes me think this might not just be log rotation.\n\nMoreover, there are other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe making registry changes. These are system processes but can sometimes be exploited by malware to gain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of XOR encryption in PowerShell scripts, multiple system process interactions, registry modifications, DNS queries, and external file creations—it's clear that this batch of events indicates potential malicious activity. The combination suggests a possible script trying to hide its communication, establish persistence, and potentially exfiltrate data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing encoded scripts with XOR encryption and making external HTTP requests, along with unusual file creations and registry modifications by various processes, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I've got a batch of system log events in JSONL format that I need to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first few entries show processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe all setting registry values. That seems a bit unusual because while some of these are legitimate system processes, others like Calculator.exe typically don't interact with the registry in normal operations.\n\n2. There's a process involving chrome.exe creating pipes and accessing the registry multiple times. While Chrome is a common application, frequent registry accesses could be a red flag, especially if they're not related to its usual operations. However, I know that some legitimate activities do involve registry access, so I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\n3. Then there's an event where whoami.exe is run from the command line. Using whoami without any unusual flags might seem normal, but sometimes it's used in scripts to check user permissions or for lateral movement in attacks. The fact that it's executed in a script context could be suspicious.\n\n4. I notice multiple powershell.exe processes with different command lines, including one that deletes a specific file in the background. Deleting files can be part of legitimate operations, but using \"& {Remove-Item...}\" without user interaction might indicate malicious activity like cleaning up traces after an attack or deleting system files to cause instability.\n\nPutting all these together, I'm concerned because there are multiple instances where processes like powershell.exe and chrome.exe are accessing the registry and performing actions that don't align with their usual behaviors. The repeated registry writes could be part of a persistence mechanism used by malware. Additionally, the deletion script in PowerShell might be attempting to remove critical files, which is a common tactic in ransomware or other malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the number of events involving these processes. While each event on its own might not be alarming, the combination suggests a pattern that's potentially malicious. For example, multiple registry writes from different processes could be setting up persistence points for an attacker to maintain access to the system. The use of whoami.exe in a script context might be probing user permissions or trying to escalate privileges.\n\nI also consider the possibility of false positives. Some of these actions could be part of legitimate software updates or background processes, but given the volume and specific nature of the events (like file deletions via PowerShell), it's more likely indicative of malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows a series of activities that, when considered together, point towards potential malicious behavior. The use of multiple tools in a way that's inconsistent with normal operations, coupled with actions like registry modifications and file deletions, suggests that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (powershell.exe, chrome.exe) performing suspicious activities including registry writes, file deletion attempts, and potential persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are all from powershell.exe with tasks indicating image loads. They're loading different .DLL files, which seems normal because PowerShell often uses these libraries. The file paths look legitimate, pointing to Microsoft.NET and other system directories, so I'm not too concerned about these yet.\n\nNext, there's a file creation event by powershell.exe in the user's Downloads folder. It's creating a temporary structure file. That could be part of normal operations, especially if the script is generating or processing something temporarily. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I see multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. Chrome often does this during updates or configuration changes, so unless there's an unusual pattern, it might not be a red flag. There are seven such events; seems like too many but could be related to some extension or update process.\n\nLooking further down, more powershell.exe events: image loads and then file creation followed by deletion of a temporary .ps1 script. The path is in the user's AppData folder under Temp, which is common for scripts. However, deleting the script after execution might indicate an attempt to remove evidence. That makes me raise an eyebrow—malicious scripts often clean up their traces.\n\nThe last few events are powershell.exe command lines with specific Remove-Item commands targeting various .bat files in different paths. Each command is trying to delete a batch file using -Force and ignoring errors, which suggests the script is attempting to remove multiple files without user interaction. This behavior could be part of legitimate cleanup processes, but it's also a tactic used by malware to delete logs or other evidence after compromising a system.\n\nPutting all this together: there are several indicators that might suggest malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell with file deletions and removal of batch scripts is concerning. Also, the pattern of creating and immediately deleting temporary PowerShell scripts could be an attempt to avoid detection. While some events are normal, the combination of multiple suspicious actions by powershell.exe, including deletion of files in a way that removes evidence, raises the possibility of malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely certain without more context. It's possible that these actions are part of a legitimate automated process or script execution. But given the nature of the commands and the repeated attempts to delete various files across different directories, the risk is higher. The confidence level isn't too high because it's possible these could be innocent scripts, but there are enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe including file deletions and attempts to remove evidence of script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being used with specific command lines. Each time, it's trying to remove files using the Remove-Item cmdlet, and some are pointing to different paths like \"C:\\tarefa_geral\\...\" and \"C:\\elemento_ativo\\...\". That seems suspicious because deleting files in a non-standard way could be an attempt at hiding or removing evidence.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is involved in other activities. For example, one event shows that a file was created in the Windows PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Creating files here might be a way to persistence or run scripts at startup without being noticed easily.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances of Registry value sets and Process accesses involving powershell.exe, conhost.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and services.exe. These activities could indicate attempts to modify system configurations, potentially for malicious purposes like creating backdoors or altering system behavior.\n\nAlso, the use of sc.exe commands to stop and delete services (like \"objeto_temporario\" and \"estrutura_secundario\") stands out. Deleting services can disrupt normal operations and might be a tactic used by attackers to remove monitoring tools or disable security features.\n\nAnother point is the repeated Process Create events for various executables, which could indicate script execution or multiple steps in a malicious process. The combination of these activities over several logs suggests a possible attack chain—reconnaissance, credential access, defense evasion, etc.—which makes the entire batch concerning.\n\nI'm also considering the types of tasks logged: Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, File created, Registry events, and Process accesses. These are common in legitimate system operations but when combined with the specific commands used (like removing files and modifying services), they raise red flags for potential malicious activity.\n\nWhile some individual actions could be benign, the overall pattern—multiple deletions, registry modifications, service manipulations—is too consistent to ignore. It's unlikely that a user would perform all these actions manually; instead, it suggests automated or script-based behavior, which is often associated with malware.\n\nTaking into account the variety and frequency of these events, along with their potential impact on system integrity, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING. The confidence level isn't 100% because there might be legitimate reasons for such activities (like cleanup scripts or administrative tasks), but the risk indicators are strong enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Remove-Item commands, deletion of services via sc.exe, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell process being created with the task 'Process Create'. Not too unusual on its own since PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe are being created. These tools can be innocent or part of an attack chain. For example, cmd.exe is often used in scripts, but it's also a favorite for attackers to execute commands.\n\nI notice several Registry value sets from different processes, especially PowerShell and cmd.exe. This could indicate configuration changes on the system, which might be malicious if they're altering security settings or creating persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some of them look suspicious. The cmd.exe has a command line with 'del \/A:H %%temp%%\\\\tarefa_logico.txt' which seems like it's trying to delete a file in the Temp directory. The use of %%temp%% might be an attempt to obfuscate or avoid detection.\n\nThere are also instances where PowerShell is being run with '& {}', which can sometimes be used to execute code without being easily detected by simple monitoring tools.\n\nA key point is the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script file in the Temp directory. The file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1' is created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior is red flags because creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection, such as cleaning up traces of malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, the events show multiple Image Load tasks from PowerShell loading various DLLs. While this isn't inherently suspicious, it could indicate that PowerShell is executing code that relies on these libraries, which might be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines, combined with registry modifications and file deletions in the Temp directory, suggests possible malicious activity.

I'll go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line representing a separate incident. The fields include process details, winlog tasks, and file information where applicable.\n\nStarting with the first event: It's from `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file. That's normal since it's likely part of the log shipping process.\n\nNext, I see several events involving `powershell.exe`. Some are pipe creation and provider\/engine lifecycle events, which can be typical for PowerShell starting up or running scripts. However, there's one event where PowerShell loads a DLL from the Windows Defender directory, which might be suspicious since it's unexpected. Additionally, there are file creation events in user directories that could indicate malicious activity, like creating files in places they shouldn't.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` accessing processes and registry values. This behavior can be normal for scripts but could also signal unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms. The fact that these activities are repeated might raise an eyebrow.\n\nThen, I notice a process creation event for `whoami.exe`. While this is a legitimate command used to check user information, in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThe next few events involve `cmd.exe`, including deleting a file and accessing registry values. The deletion of a file named `modulo_base.exe` from the Temp directory could indicate that malicious software is being cleaned up to avoid detection. Using `del \/f \/q \/s` suggests a forceful, quiet delete, which is common in scripts meant to erase evidence.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd commands, file deletions, process creations, and registry modifications without clear legitimate context—especially the repeated use of powershell.exe and the deletion of a potentially malicious file. These signs could indicate command-and-control activities or malware attempting persistence and cleanup.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if each individual action is malicious, but the combination raises enough red flags to merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell execution, file deletions, and registry modifications which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be malicious.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is executing commands to remove files in the TEMP directory. Specifically, the command {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore} stands out. This seems suspicious because deleting a file named key.log might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or logs that could be tracked.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is being executed with this command line, which suggests repeated attempts to delete the same file. The fact that it's using ErrorAction Ignore means any errors during deletion won't be shown, which can help hide activity from detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events associated with these processes. These types of events often occur when a process initializes or terminates, but combined with the repeated deletions, they might indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or evade detection by cleaning up traces.\n\nAnother point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1. This looks like it could be part of a script that's testing permissions or trying to execute code without being detected. The quick creation and deletion might be an attempt to avoid logging or leave minimal trace.\n\nLooking at the image loads, powershell.exe is loading various DLLs which is normal, but the combination with the file deletions makes me more cautious. It doesn't seem like there's any malicious payload being executed here, but the repeated attempts to delete a specific file and the script activity in the Temp directory are concerning.\n\nOverall, while each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the pattern of behavior across all these events raises flags.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries related to PowerShell execution. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any unusual usage could be a red flag. The command lines show things like deleting a file (key.log) and creating temporary files, which might be part of an attacker's cleanup process or persistence mechanism.\n\nI notice several events where registry values are being set. This is concerning because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. Additionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs, which could indicate that PowerShell is loading malicious libraries or modules.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe execution, which might be part of reconnaissance activities to gather user information. Also, the repeated ProcessAccess and PipeCreated events suggest potential communication between processes, possibly command-and-control activity or lateral movement within the network.\n\nThe file operations include creating and deleting temporary files quickly, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by security tools.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first six entries all show processes named \"powershell.exe\" with tasks related to Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle. This seems normal because PowerShell is a common tool used in various legitimate activities, including script execution and system management. However, repeated executions could be suspicious, but I'll need more context on whether this activity is usual for the user.\n\nThe seventh entry again has \"powershell.exe\" but with an Image Load task pointing to MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That's expected behavior when using security tools, so nothing odd there.\n\nNext, there's a File Create event in the PowerShell startup profile directory. This might be part of normal script execution, storing configuration data. Not immediately suspicious unless it's accessing known malicious paths or unusual times.\n\nThen I see Registry value sets and Process accesses related to \"powershell.exe\". These could be standard operations for scripts accessing system information or modifying settings. Again, not inherently malicious without additional indicators.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances of \"whoami.exe\" being executed via command line. This tool is typically used to determine user identity and can be part of legitimate troubleshooting or script execution. However, repeated use might suggest an attempt to gather system information, which could be a precursor to more malicious activities like privilege escalation.\n\nThere's also an event involving \"winlogbeat.exe\", which is likely a log management tool. The file created seems benign, part of its configuration process.\n\nThroughout the logs, there are multiple Process Create events for both PowerShell and whoami.exe. This repetition stands out because it suggests automated or script-driven activity. While not conclusive on its own, combined with the other indicators, it raises some flags.\n\nI'm considering if this could be part of a normal user's activity, perhaps running scripts or tools frequently. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions and whoami.exe might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system, which is often seen in early stages of attacks like reconnoissance.\n\nBut without seeing actual malicious commands or evidence of data exfiltration, it's hard to say definitively. The events are on the edge—could be normal sysadmin tasks or could be part of a larger attack chain.

Each entry has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\n1. The first few events mention \"powershell.exe\" being accessed under the ProcessAccess rule. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it can execute scripts and commands. Repeated access could be normal or suspicious depending on context.\n2. Then there's \"whoami.exe\" running with a command line pointing to the system32 directory. Whoami is typically benign, but if it's executed in an unusual way or multiple times, it might indicate something malicious like privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n3. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses process and registry events. Registry modifications can be concerning because attackers often use them to maintain persistence.\n4. Towards the end, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is an EDR tool, so this seems legitimate.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here since they're not included, but I notice that powershell.exe and whoami.exe are executed multiple times. The repetition could be a sign of automated malicious activity trying to stay under the radar by breaking down actions into smaller steps. Alternatively, it might just be normal system operations, especially if this is part of some script running periodically.\n\nThe combination of using PowerShell (which can execute commands) and whoami.exe (which gets user info) multiple times could indicate an attacker gathering information or attempting to run scripts. The registry access in one event stands out because attackers often use the Windows Registry for persistence.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps showing close proximity, or evidence of actual malicious activity beyond process creation and access, it's hard to say definitively. It could be a false positive if these are legitimate processes.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the repeated use of PowerShell and whoami.exe along with registry modification is concerning.
