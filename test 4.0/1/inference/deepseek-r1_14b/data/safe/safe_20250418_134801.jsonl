Then, CompatTelRunner.exe loading some DLLs—that seems standard too.\n\nNext, setup.exe creating a pipe. That could be part of the update process as well. Services.exe logon events are common for system services. The special logon and user account management tasks don't stand out as unusual on their own.\n\nThere's an event where taskhostw.exe loads taskschd.dll again—this is typical since Task Scheduler uses this DLL. Svchost.exe making registry changes is normal as it interacts with several system services.\n\nThen I see a PowerShell command being executed with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That catches my attention because even though the policy restricts scripts, sometimes attackers use this for lateral movement or persistence. The command checks INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns, which could be trying to detect certain installations. It might indicate reconnaissance or an attempt to gather information about the system.\n\nThe last events are Chrome DNS queries and another PowerShell file creation.

Next, two events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so these could be standard operations.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—nothing suspicious there. The next event is svchost.exe starting with a specific command line for BthAvctpSvc, which sounds like a legitimate service.\n\nChrome.exe modifying the registry again; not unusual. MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll—that seems related to task scheduling, which is normal. Another winlogbeat file creation—still part of data collection.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again; this is common for compatibility features. Now, multiple svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization directory. This might be a bit odd because I don't recallsvchost.exe typically handling file operations there. It could be legitimate Windows updates but worth noting.\n\nThen there's MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe both creating and deleting files. Edge updates are expected to download and remove old files, so that seems okay. MpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related DLLs—normal for malware scanning.\n\nA file delete by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe in the Temp folder is standard during updates. Another MpCmdRun.exe file creation with a lock file name—it's part of normal operations to prevent concurrent access.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe modifying registry values. Conhost is used for console windows, and mintty is a terminal emulator; their actions here don't raise flags immediately.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events are standard system processes doing their jobs—loading DLLs, creating\/ deleting files, registry changes. However, the svchost.exe creating multiple files in DeliveryOptimization might be worth investigating because it's an unusual action for svchost.

Git is commonly used for version control and is often involved when developers are working on projects, especially with Node.js modules given the presence of 'node_modules' in the file paths.\n\nThe tasks logged are all related to creating files (FileCreate). The files being created include standard ones like LICENSE, README.md, package.json, etc., which are typical for a node_modules directory as it's part of a software project structure. These are usually set up when installing or initializing npm packages.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to specific modules such as 'serialize-javascript', 'set-blocking', and 'set-function-length'. These module names seem legitimate and are often used in Node.js applications for tasks like data serialization, asynchronous blocking operations, and function length checks. This suggests that this is part of a normal development environment where someone is setting up or updating their project dependencies.\n\nThe repetition of the same process name and similar task descriptions indicates that these events are likely occurring during a single operation, such as cloning a repository, installing dependencies, or initializing a project with npm. Such activities are standard in a developer's workflow and don't raise any red flags related to malicious behavior.\n\nMoreover, there's no indication of unusual file creation patterns. For instance, creating files in unexpected locations, attempts to modify system files, or the absence of user interaction (like running an installer) isn't present here. The files are all within a project-specific directory ('C:\\Users\\...'), which is a common place for development work.\n\nAnother point to consider is that git.exe could be part of legitimate operations like fetching updates, switching branches, or merging code changes. These actions often involve creating new files or directories as part of the version control process.\n\nGiven all these factors—the consistent and expected use of git.exe, the creation of standard project files within a node_modules directory, and the lack of any indicators of suspicious activity—it's reasonable to classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" from a cybersecurity perspective.

Since each event shows that git.exe is creating files in a typical node_modules folder, which is standard in JavaScript\/Node.js projects, these activities seem normal. Node modules are usually downloaded and installed when running npm commands, especially during the setup or update of dependencies.\n\nI should consider whether \"git.exe\" typically performs file creation tasks. Git can execute shell commands via hooks or scripts, but in this case, since all events are about creating files in a node_modules directory, it's more likely that these are part of a build process or dependency installation rather than malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all within a structured directory related to SSH key management (sshpk), which is a legitimate library.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each one is a JSON object representing an event. All the events have the same process name: \"git.exe\". The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means a file was created on the system. The paths all point to files within a directory structure under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" followed by various package names like \"sshpk\", \"string-width\", etc.\n\nHmm, so what's going on here? Well, Git is being used here. Typically, when someone uses Git, especially in the context of Node.js modules (since node_modules is a standard directory for npm packages), it makes me think this is part of a software development environment. The user might be cloning a repository or installing dependencies using npm, which would involve creating files and directories.\n\nEach event shows that a file was created by git.exe. That's normal when you're working with version control systems because Git needs to create its own metadata files (like .gitignore, etc.) and also when checking out new versions of the repository, it creates new files as needed.\n\nLooking at the specific paths, they all seem to be within a node_modules directory, which is common in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. The package names like \"string-width\" and \"strip-ansi\" are typical npm packages used for string manipulation and ANSI escape code handling, respectively. These packages are often dependencies of other libraries or applications.\n\nSo why would these events be interesting? Well, sometimes when you see a lot of file creation events from Git in the same directory, it could indicate a data exfiltration or file installation activity. But in this case, since they're under node_modules and the package names are standard, it's more likely that someone is just working on a Node.js project.\n\nHowever, I should also consider whether there's anything unusual here. Are these files being created at an odd time? Is there any indication of malicious behavior elsewhere? From what I can see in the logs provided, each event is standalone and doesn't indicate any signs of compromise beyond normal development activities.\n\nAnother angle: could Git activity be used as a vector for attacks? While Git itself isn't inherently malicious, it's possible that an attacker might abuse it. For example, if someone checks out files from a compromised repository, they might inadvertently install malware. But again, the package names here don't suggest anything malicious.\n\nThe paths also don't seem to indicate any unusual locations beyond what you'd expect in a development setup. They're all within the user's downloads directory but inside a project folder that seems legitimate.\n\nSo putting it all together: these logs show normal Git activity associated with Node.js module installations.

The files listed are typical Node.js module components like .js, .d.ts, package.json, and documentation files like README.md and LICENSE. \n\nSince all these events show the creation of expected files during a git operation, there doesn't seem to be any unusual activity here.

Let's look at the events given.\n\nAll these JSON objects have similar structures. Each one has a \"process\" field where the name is \"git.exe\". Then there's a \"winlog\" indicating that a file was created, with a specific rule mentioned. The \"file\" path varies but seems to be under the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\. Each event corresponds to a different file being created.\n\nHmm, so what's happening here? Git.exe is typically associated with version control systems. When you clone a repository or update files using Git, it sometimes creates new files in the node_modules directory if you're working on a project that uses Node.js. The tcomb library is a type checker for JavaScript\/TypeScript, commonly used in projects where strict type checking is necessary.\n\nLooking at all these file creations, they seem to be part of the normal setup when a developer sets up or updates their environment. Each of these files (like Nil.js, Number.js, etc.) are standard parts of the tcomb library. So it makes sense that Git would create them as part of pulling down the repository or installing dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, no execution logs, nothing out of place in terms of the files being created under a legitimate directory structure.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this batch of events to see if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. So, I have multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event. They all seem to follow the same structure, so first, I'll try to understand what each part means.\n\nLooking at one line: {\"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\tcomb\\\\lib\\\\fromJSON.js\"}}\nOkay, so the process name is git.exe. That makes me think it's related to Git, which is a version control system used for software development. The winlog task says \"File created,\" with a specific rule called FileCreate. The file path points to a .js file inside a node_modules directory.\n\nI remember that node_modules is a folder in JavaScript projects where all the dependencies are stored. Tcomb seems like a library or module, possibly related to type checking or something similar. So, it looks like Git is creating files within a project's node_modules. That makes sense if someone is working on a Node.js project and using Git for version control.\n\nSince there are multiple events here—each one creating a different .js file in the same directory—it seems consistent with normal development activities. When you install dependencies or run certain commands, especially with npm (Node Package Manager), it's common to see files being created or modified in node_modules. Git might be tracking these changes as part of version control.\n\nNow, thinking about whether this is interesting for cybersecurity: Are there any red flags here? Let me check the file paths again. They're all within a user's Downloads folder under \"inatel\" which I assume is an institution or organization name, followed by a course on Software Quality. The path structure doesn't seem suspicious; it's a typical project setup.\n\nThe process name git.exe is standard for Git operations. If there were something malicious, like an unusual file being created outside the expected directories or with unexpected permissions, that would be more concerning. But here, all events are within node_modules and related to creating JavaScript files, which aligns with normal development behavior.\n\nAlso, considering the volume—there are 14 such events in this batch. It's possible that during a bulk operation, like installing multiple dependencies or cloning a repository, Git might create several files at once. This isn't an unusual number for someone working on a project with many modules or files.\n\nI should also think about whether creating these files could be part of a malicious activity. Maybe if these files were executing code upon creation or had suspicious content, it would raise concerns. But without additional information about the file contents or other indicators of compromise (like writes to unexpected locations, network connections, etc.), there's no evidence here that these events are malicious.\n\nAnother angle is checking for consistency in timestamps and process activities. If all these file creations happened within a very short timeframe and involved multiple processes, it could be suspicious. But since they're all from the same Git process and sequential, it seems legitimate.\n\nIn summary, while each event is a file creation, the context provided (process name, file paths) doesn't indicate any malicious behavior. They fit a standard scenario of someone working on a software project using Git and Node.js.

Git is often used for version control, especially in development environments. The node_modules directory is where Node.js packages are stored. So it seems like someone is working on a project that uses Node.js and git. The creation of multiple files under node_modules might be part of installing or updating dependencies.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is normal or if it's something suspicious. Since these are file creation events during development, they're expected when packages are installed. Git could be involved in checking out a repository or managing the project structure. There's no indication of unusual behavior like access to sensitive files, multiple failed login attempts, or any signs of malware activity.\n\nI should also think about confidence levels. Since all events are consistent and relate to normal development activities, I don't see any red flags. The confidence level would be high that this isn't malicious.\n\nSo putting it together, the batch doesn't seem interesting for investigation because these are typical actions during software development.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate normal file creation activities by a git process in a node_modules directory, likely related to software development. No signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
