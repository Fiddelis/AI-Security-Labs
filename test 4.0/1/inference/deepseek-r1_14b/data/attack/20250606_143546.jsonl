{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of events and decide if they're interesting or not. The user provided several JSONL entries, each with process info, winlog task, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. Looking deeper, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing files and registry values, which might indicate someone trying to gather info or make changes.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line that includes importing a script from 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That's a long path. I'm not sure if those folders are legitimate, but it seems suspicious. The script is then trying to run with some error handling and a sleep command at the end.\n\nThere are file creation and deletion events too. Powershell creates a temp file named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1', then deletes it shortly after. This might be an attempt to bypass certain script policies or leave less evidence, which is something attackers often do.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity from 'svchost.exe' creating a log file and modifying the registry. Svchost is a common system process but can also be used maliciously if it's running unexpected services or scripts.\n\nPutting this together, the repeated powershell activities with script execution and temp file handling are concerning. The combination of process creations, registry accesses, file operations, and the specific script path make me think there's potential malicious behavior here. I'm not 100% certain without more context, but the indicators point towards something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts and accessing system resources, including file creation\/deletion in temp directory and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is from RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Runtime Broker handles runtime aspects of Windows services. Next, HxTsr.exe also sets a registry value. I'm not familiar with that process, but it might be legitimate depending on the context.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe, which is known for hosting various system services, setting registry values isn't unusual. Then there's sppsvc.exe creating a file in the cache directoryâ€”that sounds routine too, possibly related to software protection.\n\nPowershell.exe shows up twice: once creating a profile data file and another time setting a registry value. Powershell can be used maliciously, but without more context, these actions might be part of normal operations or user scripts.\n\nMultiple events from svchost.exe are creating files in the Windows SoftwareDistribution Download folder. This is where Windows Update downloads packages, so creating files here could be part of update processes. However, multiple file creations in this directory by svchost.exe might indicate something unusual because typically, these files would be created by known update services.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll across different processes. These DLLs are standard Windows components, so their loading isn't inherently suspicious unless the context suggests misuse.\n\nPutting it all together: most of these activities align with normal system operations. However, the multiple file creations in the SoftwareDistribution Download folder by svchost.exe could be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses this directory to drop files, mimicking update processes. While I'm not certain, there's enough here to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events in the Windows SoftwareDistribution Download directory by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity or anomalies requiring investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these entries are from svchost.exe. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by various services, but sometimes malware can hide under this name. So, the repeated use of svchost.exe could be suspicious, especially if there's unusual activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks: most events are either \"Registry value set\" or \"File created\". Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms, where attackers set registry values to ensure their malware runs on startup. The file creation events point to specific paths. For example, 'C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic\\...' and 'C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\Logs\\edbtmp.log' don't ring any immediate bells as standard Windows files. Also, the path 'C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\3d2d4f109832e8e4a9776db11ac71c44' seems arbitrary and possibly a download location for something malicious.\n\nAnother thing is that some events don't have a process name, like the one where \"process\":\"None\". That could indicate another process creating files without being tied to svchost.exe, which might be worth looking into if it's an unexpected process.\n\nI also see multiple instances of the same file paths being created. This repetition could suggest that something is trying to write data repeatedly to specific locations, possibly exfiltrating data or setting up a communication channel.\n\nConsidering all these points together: repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, creation of files in non-standard directories, and some events without process context. These patterns are not typical of normal system operations. Malware often uses svchost.exe as a dropper and manipulates the registry for persistence or writes to logs to hide its activities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch shows signs that might indicate malicious behavior. The combination of registry changes, file creations in unusual paths, and multiple events under svchost.exe makes it relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creation activities by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious behavior or unusual system activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe and MpSigStub.exe. Svchost is a common system process, often used by services, so seeing it in the logs isn't unusual. It created files in \"C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install\", which looks like standard Windows update stuff because SoftwareDistribution is where updates are stored.\n\nThen there's MpSigStub.exe, which I recognize as part of Microsoft Defender. It creates several files in a temp directory with long GUID-like names. These seem to be related to file updates or patches since they include terms like \"Delta_Patch\" and version numbers. This activity is normal for antivirus software updating.\n\nLooking at setup.exe entries, they're creating various .exe files under the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. Setup.exe is commonly used during software installations or updates. The paths mentioned are standard locations for installed programs, so this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThere's also RuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values and powershell.exe being accessed via ProcessAccess. While PowerShell can be a concern because it's often used by attackers, in this case, the event is just about process access without any signs of malicious commands or scripts.\n\nOverall, all these events are typical for system processes handling updates, antivirus activities, and software installations. There's no indication of unusual behavior, such as accessing unauthorized files, multiple failed attempts, or known malicious patterns. So, I don't think this batch is particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes handling updates and installations, including Microsoft Defender activities and EdgeCore setup tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a whoami.exe process running. That doesn't seem too suspicious on its own because it's often used just to check user information. But then I see powershell.exe showing up multiple times with different tasks. Powershell can be legitimate but is also commonly used in attacks because of its scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking closer, one of the powershell.exe entries has a command line that looks like it's creating a new service and starting it. The command includes 'New-Service' which creates a new Windows service, and then 'Start-Service'. This could be a sign of an attacker trying to install a persistent backdoor or malicious service on the system.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various image files. While Powershell does load many DLLs during normal operation, the specific files being accessed might need closer look. However, in this case, most of them are standard .NET framework components and Windows Defender stuff, which doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nThere's also a file creation and deletion happening in the user's temporary directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. Temporary files created by Powershell scripts aren't unusual, but the fact that it's being deleted shortly after might be suspicious. Attackers often clean up their traces quickly.\n\nAdditionally, services.exe is modifying registry values multiple times. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but frequent changes to the registry could indicate configuration of malicious services or attempts to hide processes.\n\nPutting all this together: there are several red flags here. The use of Powershell to create and start a new service, coupled with temporary file creation and deletion, suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated registry modifications by both powershell.exe and services.exe could be part of an attack chain setting up persistence or installing malware.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including creating a new service, temporary file operations, and frequent registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process name is 'tarefa_logico.exe'. Each of these seems to be loading different DLL files related to .NET Framework and mscoree.dll. This could be normal if this process is part of legitimate operations, but it's something to keep an eye on since unusual DLL loads can sometimes indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are several events involving 'powershell.exe'. Some of these show file creation in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory, which isn't a common location. More concerning is that some logs mention remote command execution and importing modules from specific paths like 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. Using PowerShell to execute scripts from arbitrary locations, especially with commands like Invoke-entrada_principal, raises red flags because attackers often use such techniques for lateral movement or executing malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, multiple entries show the same command line being executed repeatedly. This repetition could be a sign of scripting or automated behavior, which might not be suspicious in some contexts but combined with the remote execution and unknown scripts, it increases the concern level.\n\nThere are also events where both 'process' and 'winlog' tasks are marked as None, which is unusual. Such null values might indicate incomplete logging or potential obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this all together, while some of these activities could be part of normal operations (like legitimate script execution), the combination of multiple PowerShell invocations with specific modules from non-standard paths, repeated command lines, and DLL loading from .NET components suggests a higher likelihood of malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe executing scripts from unusual paths and invoking remote commands, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, the first event shows a PowerShell command running `import-module` and then invoking `entrada_principal`. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when importing modules from non-standard paths.\n\nLooking at the subsequent events, I notice several instances where `New-Service` is called to create a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path. This repetition makes me think it's part of an automated process or script. Creating multiple services could be a sign of persistence mechanisms in malware, allowing malicious code to run on startup.\n\nThen there are events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file path points to `componente_auxiliar.ps1`. The fact that this script is being executed remotely and appears multiple times suggests it's central to whatever process is happening. Malware often drops scripts or executes them from remote locations to avoid detection.\n\nThe combination of these eventsâ€”using PowerShell, creating new services, executing a script multiple timesâ€”raises red flags. Such behavior could be indicative of an attack where the script is being run repeatedly to establish persistence or perform malicious tasks like data exfiltration or system compromise.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events have 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks in winlog. These might indicate the creation or modification of services or drivers, which is another common tactic in attacks to maintain control over a system.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of PowerShell with these specific commands, combined with remote script execution, points towards potentially malicious activity. The consistency across events suggests it's not just random processes but part of a coordinated attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts from non-standard paths and creating new services, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see entries where \"winlog\" has a task of \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That seems suspicious because executing remote commands can be a common indicator of malicious activity, like command-line attacks or remote execution exploits. The file path mentioned is \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\"â€”I notice it's a PowerShell script, which is often used by attackers for various malicious tasks due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nThe events where \"process\" is null and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any associated file might indicate attempts to run scripts or commands without necessarily having an active process, perhaps because they're executed from another context. But then there are other entries where \"process\" is listed as \"services.exe,\" which is a legitimate Windows process related to services management. These have tasks like \"Logon\" and \"Special Logon.\" I know that services.exe can be involved in user logon processes, so these might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nHowever, the overwhelming majority of events are the ones with \"Execute a Remote Command,\" especially pointing to the same PowerShell script path each time. Repeating the same file path multiple times could indicate an attempt at persistence or repeated attacks trying the same method. This repetition raises concerns because attackers often test multiple times or use different methods to execute their payload.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some events have \"Special Logon\" tasks, which in Windows usually refers to logons from network shares or remote desktops, but these are less frequent in this batch. The majority is still the remote command executions pointing to the same script path, which makes me think about possible fileless attacks or attempts to run malicious scripts.\n\nI'm also considering whether \"Execute a Remote Command\" is a common event or if it's something unusual. In normal operations, especially on systems without remote command execution as part of routine tasks, such events would stand out. Since this script path isn't a known legitimate one, it's more likely to be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that all these \"Execute a Remote Command\" events are pointing to the same file path suggests coordinated behavior, possibly from an attacker trying different entry points or multiple attempts to execute the same payload. This repetition could indicate failed attempts being retried or part of a broader attack campaign.\n\nI'm also thinking about the possibility of this being a data dump with some normal and some suspicious events, but given that the majority are the same type pointing to the same file, it's more likely indicative of malicious activity rather than just noise. The presence of legitimate processes like \"services.exe\" might be part of the environment, but they don't outweigh the numerous potential attack attempts.\n\nConsidering all these factors togetherâ€”the repeated execution of a PowerShell script associated with remote commands and the high volume of such eventsâ€”it seems highly relevant for investigation. This batch could indicate a potential breach or an ongoing attack attempt that needs to be looked into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of 'Execute a Remote Command' events targeting the same PowerShell script, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this cybersecurity analysis. I have a batch of JSONL events to evaluate. My goal is to determine if these events collectively indicate something interesting that requires investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each line starts with \"process\":\"None\", which suggests there was no process created or involved in the activity logged. The \"winlog\" field contains different tasks: most are \"Execute a Remote Command\", some are \"Windows Update Agent\", and one has \"task\": \"None\". \n\nThe file paths provided point to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\" in multiple events. This path looks unusual, possibly containing non-English characters which might be a red flag for potential malicious activities, as attackers sometimes use such names to avoid detection.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch: there are 18 events. The first 14 are all \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks accessing the same PowerShell script file. This repetition is concerning because repeated attempts to execute scripts might indicate automated or malicious behavior, especially if it's the same script each time.\n\nThe next event has \"task\": \"None\", which doesn't provide much detail but could be an anomaly. Then there are two events with \"Windows Update Agent\" tasks without a file path. While legitimate Windows update activities can use such logs, the combination of these with the previous high volume of remote command executions raises suspicion.\n\nThe fact that all suspicious events involve the same script file is significant. It's possible that an attacker is trying to execute malicious code repeatedly. The lack of process information might be a tactic to evade detection by not creating new processes that could be monitored.\n\nI also need to consider if these activities are within normal operational parameters. For instance, legitimate scripts might run periodically, but the high frequency and specific file path suggest they're out of the ordinary. Additionally, \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks are often associated with remote administration tools or malicious actors trying to execute commands on a system.\n\nThe confidence level is high because multiple identical events with potentially malicious characteristics indicate possible coordinated activity rather than random anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated attempts to execute the same remote command involving a PowerShell script file may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
