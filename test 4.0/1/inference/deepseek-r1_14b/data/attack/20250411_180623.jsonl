{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a Chrome process doing a DNS query. That seems normal because browsers do that all the time when navigating. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext up are multiple PowerShell.exe entries. I notice several tasks related to registry changes and image loading. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks, but it can also be abused by attackers. The file paths loaded in these events look like standard system files, which might not be unusual, but repeated Registry writes could indicate something fishy.\n\nThen there are two events where a file was created and immediately deleted. Creating temporary files is common, especially in scripts, but deleting them right after might be an attempt to erase evidence. This could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from the same command line. These seem repetitive, which makes me wonder if it's part of a script loop or something more malicious like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are also pipe creation events and references to Defender files being loaded. While Defender is legitimate, seeing too many such events might suggest an attempt to evade detection or interact with system services in an unusual way.\n\nConsidering all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell, especially with registry modifications and file deletions, stands out. These actions are often part of attack chains—like lateral movement, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with unusual file operations and registry modifications, including a temporary file creation and deletion, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is from powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. That seems a bit fishy because PowerShell scripts are often used for malicious activities, and writing to startup folders could mean persistence.\n\nNext, there's another powershell.exe event where it sets a registry value. Registry changes can be part of installing malware or configuring persistence mechanisms. So that's something to note.\n\nThen, conhost.exe is setting a registry value too. I'm not sure what conhost.exe does off the top of my head, but if it's doing registry modifications without a clear reason, it might be suspicious.\n\nThe fourth event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own data directory. Winlogbeat is legitimate software for log management, so this seems normal unless there's something wrong with how it's being used here.\n\nBack to powershell.exe again, this time creating a file named estrutura_logico.txt. The name suggests some kind of logical structure or maybe logging. But without context, it's hard to say if that's normal. Also, the path is in Downloads, which could be expected for user-generated files but might not always be safe.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing a process. Process access events can be part of legitimate activities like debugging, but they can also indicate malicious behavior such as creating child processes or injecting code.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creates the same file again, which seems repetitive and possibly unnecessary unless there's an issue with how winlogbeat is handling its configuration files.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple events from powershell.exe performing various actions—file creation, registry modifications, process access. These are red flags because they can be indicators of malicious scripts trying to establish persistence or perform other malicious activities. Conhost.exe also doing a registry set adds more concern. Winlogbeat's activity seems normal but the repetition might warrant a closer look.\n\nThe confidence is high because while some events could be benign, the combination of several suspicious actions by powershell.exe and conhost.exe suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file creation and registry modifications, along with conhost.exe modifying the registry. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
