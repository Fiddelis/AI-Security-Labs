{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are all from chrome.exe, which is just a regular browser process doing DNS queries and network connections. That's pretty normal, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen I notice powershell.exe showing up multiple times. Powershell can be legitimate but it's often used in attacks because of its scripting capabilities. Looking closer, one event shows that powershell accessed some registry values (RegistryEvent) which could indicate malicious activity trying to change system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are several ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe, which is concerning because attackers might use this to execute scripts. The command line in one of these events has a long string with some XOR operations and a POST request to example.com. This looks like an attempt to encode data (probably stolen information) and send it over the network. Using XOR isn't very sophisticated but could be part of an obfuscation technique.\n\nI also see multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various .NET DLLs which is normal, but sometimes attackers load malicious modules or legitimate ones in a way that's unusual. The fact that several different files are being loaded might just be how Powershell operates, but it's worth noting.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory with a name that includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\". This is suspicious because creating and deleting temporary files can be part of malicious scripts trying to avoid detection or to test script execution policies. The filename seems crafted to imply it's a policy test, which could be a red flag.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of Powershell with registry modifications, network activity (like the POST request), and file operations in the Temp directory suggests potential malicious behavior. However, without seeing more context or actual malicious code execution, it's hard to be certain. Still, these activities are unusual enough that they merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe indicate potential malicious activity, including registry access and network communication.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with a specific command line. Each command seems to be encoding plaintext data using XOR cipher and sending it via HTTP POST to example.com.\n\nThe first event shows that the process is powershell.exe creating a pipe. The subsequent events all have similar command lines, suggesting repeated attempts or part of a script execution. The use of a simple XOR cipher might indicate obfuscation techniques to hide data being exfiltrated.\n\nThe fact that the same command appears multiple times could mean either an automated script running or a malicious process trying different ways to send data. The target URL is example.com, which is generic, making it harder to pinpoint without more context. However, the pattern of repeated attempts and encoding suggests potential malicious activity, like data exfiltration.\n\nI should also consider if this behavior is normal for the system. If powershell.exe with such commands isn't typical, it could be suspicious. The combination of encryption-like steps (even though XOR is basic) and network communication makes me lean towards 'INTERESTING' as there's a possible security event here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing similar encoded command lines, potentially indicating malicious activity such as data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The command line in some of these events looks suspicious because it's encoding plaintext data and sending it via HTTP POST to example.com. This could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data or establish communication with a remote server, which are red flags for potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value sets and process accesses related to powershell.exe. These activities might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure the payload runs on subsequent system restarts. Additionally, the use of xor cipher (as seen in the command line) suggests an attempt to obfuscate data, which is commonly used to avoid detection.\n\nI also see that some events are related to legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and notepad.exe accessing registry values or files. However, these aren't unusual on their own. The high volume of powershell activities stands out more, especially since they involve multiple potentially malicious actions across different log entries.\n\nWhile there's no direct evidence of harmful outcomes like file deletions or system modifications in these logs, the combination of suspicious command-line arguments, encoding for data transmission, and repeated registry modifications raises concerns about possible malicious intent. \n\nConsidering all these factors together, it seems plausible that this batch could indicate a security incident, making it worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious powershell.exe activities including data encoding and exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe are setting registry values. That seems a bit normal since some applications do write to the registry during operation. But then I notice that powershell.exe is also doing the same thing—setting registry values. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can be abused by attackers, so that's something to note.\n\nThere's an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe. Pipes are used for interprocess communication, which could be normal, especially for applications like Chrome that might need to communicate with other processes or plugins.\n\nLooking at the file events, most don't have a specific file associated, but some do. For instance, when chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll—those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so nothing suspicious there. There's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new config file; that makes sense if it's running for the first time or updating its configuration.\n\nNow, I see several whoami.exe processes being created. Whoami is typically used to display user information and isn't inherently malicious, but in some contexts, it might be part of privilege escalation attempts. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThe powershell.exe events catch my attention again. There's a command line that shows it executing a script: Remove-Item with a specific path. The path has backslashes and some encoded names which could be an attempt to hide the actual file being deleted. Also, using -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the user is trying to remove files without any confirmation or error messages, which might indicate they don't want any prompts.\n\nPutting this together: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values and running scripts that delete specific files. The fact that one of the commands uses a script with encoded paths (like \"objeto_temporario\" which translates to temporary object in Portuguese) might be an attempt to hide malicious activity, possibly deleting logs or evidence of previous actions.\n\nWhile some events could be benign, the combination of repeated powershell.exe activities, especially script execution and file deletion, along with potential encoding in filenames, raises red flags. It's possible that this batch indicates a potential attack where the attacker is trying to cover their tracks by deleting log files or other traces.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values and executing scripts, particularly one script attempting to delete specific files with encoded paths, suggest potential malicious activity aiming to remove logs or evidence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system events. I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell activity here, which immediately raises some red flags because it's commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. \n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where PowerShell is loading various .NET framework DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, andclrjit.dll. These aren't unusual in themselves, but the repeated ImageLoad events could indicate that something is trying to load these modules multiple times, which might be a sign of suspicious activity.\n\nNext, there are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected tasks related to temporary files created by PowerShell. The file paths like __PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1 seem auto-generated, which makes me think that these could be part of some automated process or potentially malicious script trying to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several Remove-Item commands being executed via PowerShell, each targeting specific batch files. These deletions occur across different paths, suggesting a concerted effort to remove multiple files. The use of \"-Force\" and \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" in the command lines stands out because these parameters suppress errors and force deletion without confirmation, which is often a tactic used by malware to delete logs or other evidence.\n\nThe fact that both PowerShell and Chrome are showing registry changes (RegistryEvent) might not be directly malicious on their own, but when combined with the high volume of PowerShell activity, it adds to the suspicion. Malicious actors often use multiple tools to cover their tracks or carry out different stages of an attack.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern here that suggests potentially malicious behavior: repeated loading of modules, creation and deletion of temporary files, and forced deletions of specific files across various paths. These actions could be part of an attempt to remove evidence or execute harmful scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events including file deletions, image loads, and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process with a command line that deletes a .bat file using Remove-Item. That seems suspicious because deleting files can be part of malicious activity. The task is 'Provider Lifecycle', which might relate to service changes but combined with the command, I should note this.\n\nThe next few events are also PowerShell instances. Some have similar command lines deleting other .bat files in different paths. These repeated deletions look intentional and possibly malicious since they're targeting specific scripts that might be part of a system's configuration or security mechanisms.\n\nI notice several events where PowerShell is accessing processes, setting registry values, and creating files. For example, there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That location isn't typically associated with normal user activities, which could indicate an attempt to persist across reboots—a common tactic for malware.\n\nThere are also cmd.exe processes executing SC commands to stop and delete services like 'objeto_temporario' and 'estrutura_secundario'. Using sc.exe is a way to manage services, but doing this without legitimate cause might be part of a service disruption or removal. Malware often stops services to disable security features.\n\nLooking at other events, conhost.exe and whoami.exe are running. Conhost is usually used for console applications, and while it's not inherently malicious, its use alongside other suspicious activities could be a red flag. The whoami command is typically harmless on its own but when combined with deletion scripts, it might be part of information gathering.\n\nThe services.exe processes modifying the registry might be trying to hide their presence or alter system configurations. Registry modifications are common in attacks to achieve persistence or modify security settings.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they show a series of actions that could be part of an attack chain: deleting files, stopping and removing services, accessing processes, and modifying the registry. These activities don't seem to be normal user operations and are more indicative of potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm also noticing that the same commands appear multiple times, which suggests automation or scripting—a technique often used by attackers to execute multiple steps efficiently. The combination of different tools (Powershell, cmd.exe, whoami) being used in quick succession is another red flag, as it's uncommon for legitimate processes to chain these together.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows a sequence of events that are unusual and potentially malicious, involving file deletions, service management, registry changes, and process accesses. The repetition and combination of tools make me confident that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated deletion of .bat files using PowerShell, stopping and deleting services via cmd.exe, and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a batch of JSONL events and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each event without assigning a classification per line but considering all together. Looking through the events, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with different command lines. Powershell is commonly associated with both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated usage could be suspicious.\n\nThere are several registry value sets from cmd.exe and other processes. Registry modifications can indicate malware trying to persist on a system or change system configurations. This adds more concern as such activity isn't typical in benign scenarios.\n\nI also see file creation and deletion events involving temporary files created by powershell.exe. The fact that a script is being written and then immediately deleted could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies, like script execution restrictions. This behavior might indicate the use of PowerShell for malicious scripting.\n\nThe combination of multiple process creations (Process Create), registry accesses (RegistryEvent), file operations (FileCreate, FileDeleteDetected), and image loading events from powershell.exe is notable. These activities together suggest a potential attack chain, possibly involving reconnaissance, credential access, or lateral movement.\n\nMoreover, the use of command-line arguments in processes like cmd.exe for deleting files could be part of an attempt to erase traces or disrupt normal operations. The specific paths mentioned, such as deleting from the temp directory, might point towards data exfiltration or destruction attempts.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the batch shows a pattern that is consistent with potential malicious activities. While it's possible some actions are legitimate, the volume and nature of these events raise red flags. Therefore, this batch merits further investigation to assess the risk and determine if an actual breach has occurred.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe process creations and activities, including file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and potential script execution.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple events involving `powershell.exe`. Powershell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command line in some of these powershell processes seems suspicious: `'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {}'` – that doesn't look like a typical legitimate use of Powershell. Empty curly braces might indicate that something was redacted or removed, which is a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where `powershell.exe` loads `MpClient.dll`, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal, but it's worth noting as sometimes malware can hide within legitimate processes. Then, there are several registry value sets by powershell and other processes like `cmd.exe`. Registry changes are often used in persistence mechanisms by attackers to maintain access.\n\nAnother point is the deletion of a file using cmd.exe: `'command_line': 'del \/f \/q \/s %TEMP%\\\\unidade_auxiliar.exe'`. Deleting files, especially with switches for force and quiet operation, could be an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where processes access other processes, like `ProcessAccess` tasks. This can indicate potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. The repeated occurrence of these events is concerning as it suggests a pattern rather than isolated incidents.\n\nThe use of `whoami.exe` and the creation of various files under user directories (like `AppData`) also stands out. These could be part of reconnaissance activities to gather system information or to create configuration files for further attacks.\n\nConsidering all these together – multiple powershell instances with odd command lines, file deletions, registry modifications, process access events, and file creations – it paints a picture that's more than just normal system activity.

The user wants me to analyze all the events together, considering their combination, and decide whether it's worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep in mind. Let's go through each event.\n\nThe first few logs show 'powershell.exe' accessing processes and files. For example, there are events where it accesses (ProcessAccess) and creates a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\tarefa_comum.txt. Then, there are multiple instances of commands running in PowerShell that try to remove a log file in the TEMP directory with -ErrorAction Ignore. This command is repeated several times, which stands out because it's attempting the same action multiple times.\n\nLooking at other events, I see tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, which might be normal for script execution but could also indicate some level of scripting activity. There are also Image Load events where PowerShell is loading various DLLs, which is typical as PowerShell uses .NET components.\n\nAnother point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1. The fact that it's created and then deleted might be part of a script checking permissions or trying to avoid detection, which raises some flags.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated attempts to delete key.log with ErrorAction Ignore suggest someone is trying to remove logs without wanting any errors to show up, possibly to cover their tracks. The creation and deletion of the temporary PowerShell script file could be part of a larger malicious process, maybe testing if certain actions are allowed or just cleaning up after themselves.\n\nWhile some of these actions might seem innocent, especially since they're all from powershell.exe, the combination—especially the repeated delete commands and the file operations in TEMP—is concerning. It feels like it could be indicative of malicious activity, such as a script trying to remove logs or files without user knowledge.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events show attempts to delete a log file and create\/execute scripts in the TEMP directory, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event from some logs. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few events, I see several instances where powershell.exe is being executed with different command lines. For example, one has \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}\", which seems like it's trying to delete a file in the TEMP directory named key.log. That might be suspicious because deleting log files could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe is creating or accessing files and registry values. I notice that some of these involve loading various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell scripts, but it's worth keeping an eye on how many different modules are being loaded. Also, there's a file created in the TEMP directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1, and then immediately after, that same file is deleted. Creating and then deleting a script file quickly could be a tactic to avoid detection or to execute malicious code temporarily.\n\nLooking further down, there are events involving conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost.exe is often used by PowerShell to host console applications, so it's not inherently suspicious, but combined with the other activities, it might be part of a larger script execution. The whoami.exe command itself isn't malicious, but if it's being executed in an environment where such commands are unexpected, it could raise flags.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that many events involve registry value changes. Modifying the Windows Registry can be legitimate for configuration purposes, but certain patterns might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThe fact that so many events relate to PowerShell activity is concerning because PowerShell is a powerful tool often abused by attackers for execution and lateral movement. The combination of deleting files, creating\/ deleting script files in TEMP, accessing processes, and registry modifications could all be signs of malicious activity.\n\nI also see that the same process names and command lines are repeated multiple times, which might suggest some form of looping or repeated commands within a script, possibly to avoid detection by varying the timing or parameters each time.\n\nGiven all these points together, it seems like there's a high probability that this batch of events is indicative of malicious behavior.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting, but it can also be a red flag because attackers might use it for malicious activities like command execution or lateral movement. There are multiple entries where powershell is being executed with an empty command line, which might mean they're using it to run other scripts or commands later.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe being called several times. Whoami is usually used to get user information, so seeing it multiple times could be normal in some environments, but if it's part of a larger script or attack chain, it might indicate an attempt to gather system information for further exploitation.\n\nLooking at the event types, there are tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', and various file operations. Some events show files being created or accessed, such as MpClient.dll which is related to Windows Defender, so that seems legitimate. But then there's a new .winlogbeat.yml file being created, which might be from the winlogbeat tool itself, so I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nThe combination of multiple powershell.exe processes and whoami.exe executions stands out. Especially since they're appearing in quick succession and with empty command lines, it makes me think there's some automated process or script running. Maybe a legitimate script doing system checks, but without more context, I can't be certain.\n\nI also see that several events are marked as 'Process Create' for both powershell.exe and whoami.exe. This could indicate process spawning which is normal in scripts, but it might also be part of an attack chain where malicious processes are being created.\n\nThe file paths seem a bit concerning too. For example, the MpClient.dll is loaded by powershell, which I think is legitimate because Defender might integrate with system tools. However, other files like the winlogbeat.yml could be from log management software, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some red flags like multiple powershell executions and whoami calls, without more context about what these processes are doing or if they're part of a known malicious pattern, I'm leaning towards this being 'NOT INTERESTING'.

Whoami is usually harmless as it just displays user information, but it can sometimes be part of recon scripts. The command line seems normal, pointing to the system32 directory.\n\nLooking further, another powershell.exe event shows a registry value being set. That's concerning because attackers often modify the registry to persistence or change system configurations. This adds more weight to the possibility of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so unless it's behaving unusually, this might not be suspicious on its own.
