{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome often makes DNS queries and connects to networks as part of its operation. Nothing suspicious here at first glance.\n\nNext, I notice some powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also commonly abused in attacks. The events show 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set.' Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often tweak system settings to maintain persistence. So this might be worth looking into more.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That command is usually harmless as it just returns user information, but sometimes it's used in scripts or attacks to gather info, so maybe something to keep an eye on.\n\nThe cmd.exe entries stand out because they have complex command lines involving sc.exe and creating tasks with specific commands. SC.exe is used for managing services, and seeing it create a service like \"modulo_geral\\bin\\uunidaded_base.exe\" seems unusual unless it's part of legitimate setup. But the use of 'create' and 'start=auto' could indicate an attempt to make something run at startup without user consent.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks from services.exe. Modifying the registry repeatedly can be a sign of malicious activity trying to establish persistence or alter system configurations inappropriately.\n\nLastly, the ImageLoad events show various .NET framework components being loaded by different processes. This is normal for many applications that use .NET, so probably not suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell and cmd.exe commands with potential service creation and registry modifications are concerning. The repeated registry writes from services.exe could indicate an attempt to install a persistent backdoor or malicious service. Additionally, the sc.exe commands creating auto-starting services might be part of a persistence mechanism. These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior and could be signs of a potential attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple process creations, registry modifications, and network activities involving potentially malicious tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me try to make sense of them.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where different processes like 'tarefa_logico.exe' and 'estrutura_principal.exe' are loading image files. That's normal for applications starting up, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, I see multiple instances of processes setting registry values. The processes involved include 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', 'elemento_ativo.exe', and others. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations, especially during software installations or configurations. But seeing a variety of different processes doing this might raise an eyebrow. However, without more context on what exactly is being changed, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nLooking at the file events, 'winlogbeat.exe' created a new configuration file. That makes sense if winlogbeat is being set up or updated. No red flags there.\n\nThere are a couple of entries involving 'powershell.exe', both accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused for malicious activities. The fact that it's accessed twice might indicate some script execution, which could be either legitimate admin work or part of an attack. However, without seeing the exact commands run, I can't confirm anything.\n\nOther entries like 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and 'svchost.exe' modifying registry values are less concerning. These are common system processes, so their activity is usually benign unless they're involved in known malicious behaviors.\n\nThe events seem to cover a range of normal activities—process starts, file creations, and registry changes—which could be part of regular operations or updates. There's no clear indication of an active attack or unauthorized access based on the information provided. \n\nWhile I'm not ruling out the possibility of something amiss, there's insufficient evidence in this batch alone to classify it as definitely malicious. It might just be normal system activity with some variations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show a variety of processes performing normal operations such as loading images, accessing registries, and creating files, without evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
