{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events describes a malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown of the actions and a possible threat assessment:\n\n**Summary of Actions**\n\n1. **Task Scheduler Execution:** A scheduled task (likely a rogue one) runs `services.exe`.\n2. **Image Loading:** The process `sppsvc.exe` loads an image file, `taskschd.dll`. This is related to task scheduling.\n3. **Registry Modification:** `svchost.exe` modifies a registry value. This could be part of the malicious script's setup or cleanup.\n4. **PowerShell Invocation:** `powershell.exe` is executed. This is a critical point â€“ PowerShell is the likely carrier of the malicious script.\n5. **`whoami.exe` Execution:**  The script executes `whoami.exe` to determine the user running the script. This is common for reconnaissance purposes.\n6. **PowerShell Script Deletion:** The script deletes a file from the temporary directory (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`).\n7. **File Deletion Attempt\/Success:** A Powershell script deletes a file. The exact behavior depends on permissions, but the intent is to remove traces of the script's execution.\n8. **PowerShell Deletion:** The script attempts to delete another file named `entrada_principal.zip`.\n9. **DLL Loading:** Multiple .NET framework DLLs are loaded by Powershell, which suggests that the script requires .NET capabilities.\n\n**Detailed Analysis & Threat Assessment**\n\n*   **Initial Infection Vector:** The scheduled task execution is the likely entry point. It's highly probable that this scheduled task was created or modified by malware.\n*   **PowerShell as a Delivery Mechanism:** PowerShell is being leveraged to run malicious code. This is a common tactic because PowerShell is a legitimate system tool, making malicious use harder to detect.\n*   **File Deletion:**  The repeated file deletion attempts (first a \"test\" script and then `entrada_principal.zip`) is a very strong indicator of malicious intent. Malware often attempts to remove its traces to avoid detection. The deletion of `entrada_principal.zip` suggest that this could be the original downloaded payload.\n*   **.NET Dependency:** The loading of multiple .NET framework DLLs strongly indicates that the malicious PowerShell script utilizes .NET functionality, making its analysis and remediation a bit more involved.\n*   **Reconnaissance:** The execution of `whoami.exe` suggests reconnaissance before proceeding with the malicious actions.\n*   **Persistence:** While the script is deleting files, it may be setting up persistence through other means (e.g., creating a new scheduled task or modifying registry keys).  This requires further investigation.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n*   **Scheduled Task:** Investigate the scheduled task that launched `services.exe`. Look for unusual names, unexpected triggers, or modification dates.\n*   **PowerShell Executions:** Examine PowerShell execution logs for suspicious commands.\n*   **File Deletions:**  The files being deleted (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`, `entrada_principal.zip`) are key evidence.\n*   **Registry Modifications:**  Look for unusual registry changes related to PowerShell or scheduled tasks.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Machine:** Immediately disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent the malware from spreading.\n2.  **Malware Scan:** Run a full system scan with an updated antivirus and anti-malware solution.\n3.  **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a detailed forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise.\n4.  **Scheduled Task Review:** Carefully review all scheduled tasks and remove any suspicious ones.\n5.  **PowerShell Execution Policy:**  Enforce a stricter PowerShell execution policy to limit the ability of malicious scripts to run.\n6.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  Implement an EDR solution to provide better threat detection and response capabilities.\n7.  **User Training:**  Educate users about phishing and other social engineering attacks that could lead to malware infections.\n\n**To assist in further analysis, please provide:**\n\n*   **The full content of the scheduled task.**\n*   **Any other relevant logs or system information.**\n*   **Any available hash values for any files involved.**"}
