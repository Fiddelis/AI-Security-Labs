{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The logs indicate a series of events related to a PowerShell script that creates and starts a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".  Here's a breakdown and analysis:\n\n**1. Initial Process Creation & Registry Modification (services.exe):**\n\n*   `{'process': {'name': 'services.exe'}}`: The \"services.exe\" process (Windows Service Manager) is involved. This is common during service-related activities.\n*   `{'winlog': {'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}}`:  A registry value is modified. This likely part of the initial setup, potentially related to the environment being prepared for the new service.\n\n**2. Image Loading (sppsvc.exe and taskschd.dll):**\n\n*   `{'process': {'name': 'sppsvc.exe'}}`: This is the Software Protection Pre-installation Service, typically associated with Windows activation. Its presence here is unexpected, and warrants further investigation to understand its role in the observed behaviour.\n*   `{'winlog': {'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}}`: An image (file) is loaded into memory, specifically `taskschd.dll` (Task Scheduler DLL). The link between `sppsvc.exe` and loading `taskschd.dll` may point to a manipulation of the task scheduler.\n\n**3.  PowerShell Script Execution (Key Activity):**\n\n*   `{'process': {'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}'}`: This is the core of the activity. A PowerShell script is being executed using `powershell.exe`.  The script performs two actions:\n    *   `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`:  Creates a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo.\" The service's executable is `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  This is a critical detail: you need to examine this file (`tarefa_logico.exe`) *immediately* to determine its purpose and origin.  Malware often disguises itself as legitimate services.  The path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin` also looks suspicious and not a typical Windows path.\n    *   `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`:  Starts the newly created service.\n\n**4. Service Lifecycle Events:**\n\n*  Multiple lines repeating the same PowerShell command, each with different lifecycle stages ('Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle').  This suggests a cycle of creation, modification, or attempted restarts of the service.  This repetition is very concerning.\n\n**Key Concerns & Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n*   **Suspicious Path:**  `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin`. This is not a standard Windows directory. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n*   **`tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is the most crucial file. **You must analyze this file with an antivirus scanner, a sandbox, and potentially reverse engineering techniques.** Determine its origin, its purpose, and what it does when executed.  It is highly likely this file is malicious.\n*   **`sppsvc.exe` and `taskschd.dll` connection:** The involvement of the Software Protection Pre-installation Service is unusual and requires investigation. It may be used to evade detection or manipulate the task scheduler.\n*  **Repetitive PowerShell Commands:**  The multiple identical PowerShell commands (with slightly varying lifecycle stages) indicate that the process is being restarted or repeatedly attempted, which is characteristic of malicious activity trying to persist and evade removal.\n*   **Service Name (\"objeto_ativo\"):** While not inherently malicious, the name is somewhat generic.  Malware often uses nondescript service names to blend in.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the system from the network to prevent potential spread of malware.\n2.  **Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is the top priority. Use a reputable antivirus scanner, a sandbox environment (like Any.Run or Hybrid Analysis), and consider reverse engineering it if you have the expertise.\n3.  **Review Task Scheduler:** Check the Task Scheduler for any suspicious tasks that might be related to this service or the PowerShell script. Delete any suspicious tasks.\n4.  **Check Registry:** Look for any registry entries related to the \"objeto_ativo\" service or the path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin`.\n5.  **Scan for Rootkits:** Run a rootkit scanner to check for any hidden malware components.\n6.  **Full System Scan:** Perform a full system scan with an up-to-date antivirus solution.\n7.  **Consider Reimaging:**  Depending on the severity of the findings, reimaging the system might be the safest option.\n8.  **Investigate the Source:** Try to determine how this PowerShell script and the `tarefa_logico.exe` file were introduced onto the system.\n\n\n\n**Important:**  The provided logs strongly suggest a potential malware infection. Treat this situation with the highest level of caution.  Seek professional help from a cybersecurity expert if you are not comfortable handling this yourself."}
