{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided data indicates a malicious PowerShell script is being executed. Here's a breakdown of the events and potential severity:\n\n**1. Initial Infection\/Execution (sppsvc.exe, taskschd.dll):**\n\n*   **`sppsvc.exe`:**  This is often associated with Software Protection Services, but can be abused in attacks.  Its presence is an indicator of potential compromise.\n*   **`taskschd.dll`:** Loaded by `sppsvc.exe`.  This suggests a scheduled task is involved, likely used to persistently execute malicious code.  `Task Scheduler` is a common entry point for attackers to execute code after initial compromise.\n\n**2. PowerShell Activity (Primary Concern):**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe`:** This is the key indicator.  PowerShell is being used to perform actions.\n*   **`whoami.exe`:** Used to check the current user's identity. This is often done by attackers to understand permissions and privileges.\n*   **`powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`:** This is the most significant command. It uses the PowerShell `Remove-Item` cmdlet to delete a ZIP file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory (`$env:Temp`). The `-Force` parameter bypasses confirmation prompts. This deletion might be part of cleanup, indicating that the attackers don't want evidence of their activity to remain. This is a *very* concerning action.\n\n**3. .NET Framework Loading (mscoree.dll, clr.dll):**\n\n*   These files, part of the .NET Framework, are loaded by PowerShell. This implies the PowerShell script might be using .NET objects or functions, often for obfuscation or to perform more complex actions.\n\n**Summary & Severity:**\n\n*   **Severity:** High.  The presence of malicious PowerShell activity, particularly the deliberate deletion of a file named `entrada_principal.zip` using `Remove-Item -Force`, points to a potentially serious compromise.\n*   **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n    *   `sppsvc.exe` (potentially malicious usage)\n    *   `powershell.exe` commands\n    *   `entrada_principal.zip` (the deleted file - further investigation needed to determine its purpose)\n    *   `$env:Temp` (temporary directory targeted)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately disconnect the system from the network to prevent further spread.\n2.  **Identify the Purpose of `entrada_principal.zip`:** Try to recover the file from shadow copies (if enabled) or other backup sources to understand its contents and functionality.\n3.  **Examine Scheduled Tasks:** Thoroughly review all scheduled tasks, especially those related to `sppsvc.exe` or `powershell.exe`, to identify and disable the malicious task.\n4.  **Analyze PowerShell History:** Check PowerShell history files (if enabled) to reconstruct the complete PowerShell commands executed.\n5.  **Scan with Updated Antivirus\/EDR:** Perform a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools.\n6.  **Review System Logs:** Examine system logs for other suspicious activity.\n7.  **Investigate Lateral Movement:** Determine if the attacker has gained access to other systems on the network.\n8.  **Rebuild the System:** The most secure option is often to completely wipe and rebuild the affected system from a known good source.\n9.  **Implement Least Privilege:** Ensure users only have the minimum necessary permissions to prevent future compromise.\n\n\n\nThis is a complex situation. It's recommended to consult with a cybersecurity professional to assist with the investigation and remediation."}
