Multiple instances of `csc.exe` compiling and executing, coupled with subsequent process creation (`unidade_logico.exe`, `componente_comum.exe`, etc.) and registry modifications, strongly suggests potential malicious code compilation and execution. The execution of compiled components is concerning, and the use of temporary directories for these activities further raises suspicion. Calculator using URLMON.DLL is also a possible sign of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
