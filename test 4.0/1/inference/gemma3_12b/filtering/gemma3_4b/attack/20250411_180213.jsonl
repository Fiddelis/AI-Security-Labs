This action is a known persistence technique used by attackers to execute commands with SYSTEM privileges when the user presses Shift+F10 at the login screen. The command sequence involves copying the original `sethc.exe`, potentially modifying permissions, and then replacing it with a malicious `cmd.exe` executable. The inclusion of `powershell.exe` and multiple registry modifications further suggests potentially malicious behavior. The `winlogbeat` file creation is likely benign, but doesn't detract from the severity of the other events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
