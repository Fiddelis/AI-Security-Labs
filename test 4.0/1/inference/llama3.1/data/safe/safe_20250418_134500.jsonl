{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log of Windows event logs, specifically the \"Windows Security\" events, in JSON format. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n**Event Structure**\n\nEach event is represented as a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"process_name\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"event_task\"\n  },\n  \"file\": {\n    \"path\": \"file_path\"\n  }\n}\n```\n**Fields**\n\nThe log contains the following fields:\n\n* `process`: The process that triggered the event, with attributes:\n\t+ `name`: The name of the process (e.g., \"svchost.exe\")\n* `winlog`: The Windows Security event details, with attributes:\n\t+ `task`: The task or action that was performed (e.g., \"Process Create\", \"File Delete logged\")\n* `file`: Information about a file related to the event, with attributes:\n\t+ `path`: The full path of the file (e.g., \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download\\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}\\135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\")\n\n**Event Examples**\n\nHere are a few examples of events:\n\n1. **Process Create**\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"notepad.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"Process Create\"\n  }\n}\n```\n2. **File Delete logged**\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"File Delete logged\"\n  },\n  \"file\": {\n    \"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe\"\n  }\n}\n```\n3. **Dns query**\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"CompatTelRunner.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"Dns query\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese events appear to be related to various system activities, such as process creation, file deletion, and DNS queries."}
