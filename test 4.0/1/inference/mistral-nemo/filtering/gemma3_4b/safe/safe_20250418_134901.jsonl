Further investigation is needed to determine if these modifications are legitimate.\n\nTo investigate further, you should review the full event details and consider enabling more granular logging to gain deeper insights into these events. It's also recommended to monitor the behaviors of setup.exe, svchost.exe, and chrome.exe processes for any additional suspicious activities."}
