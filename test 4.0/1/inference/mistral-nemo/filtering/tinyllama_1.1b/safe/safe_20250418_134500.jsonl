This could indicate instability or unusual behavior.\n- Winlogbeat, a tool for shipping logs to Elasticsearch or Logstash, was run and created log files. This suggests that someone was actively monitoring or collecting system events.\n\nTo better understand the context, you might want to look at the timestamps of these activities, check if any security software or updates were running during this time, and review the contents of the created winlogbeat logs for more insights."}
