The DLL loading events could indicate that the threat is attempting to evade detection or load additional functionality.\n\nGiven these events, it's recommended to:\n\n1. Isolate the affected system.\n2. Run a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus\/antimalware software.\n3. Consider employing advanced endpoint protection and behavior monitoring tools for better detection of such threats in the future.\n4. Update all systems and applications to their latest versions to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.\n5. Review user permissions and enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize potential damage from future threats."}
