The `tasklist.exe` events combined with DLL loads from Windows Defender and AMSI also warrant further scrutiny, as they could indicate attempts to evade detection. The multiple `winlogbeat.exe` file creation events might be related to legitimate monitoring, but the other activities increase suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
