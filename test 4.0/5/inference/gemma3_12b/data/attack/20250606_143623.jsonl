{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This log data indicates a potential malicious PowerShell script execution followed by service creation and startup. Here's a breakdown of the events and potential concerns:\n\n**1. Initial Events:**\n\n*   **`services.exe` - Registry Value Set:**  This is normal behavior for many Windows services, indicating configuration changes, but it's a detail for context.\n*   **`sppsvc.exe` - Image Loaded:**  The System Preparation Service is loading `taskschd.dll`. This can be part of legitimate system activity, but its appearance alongside other suspicious activities warrants careful attention.\n*   **`svchost.exe` - Registry Value Set:**  Another common and expected Windows event, similar to the `services.exe` registry change.\n\n**2. The Key Suspicious Event:  Repeated PowerShell Execution**\n\nThe most concerning events are the repeated execution of this PowerShell command:\n\n```powershell\npowershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n```\n\nLet's break down what this command does:\n\n*   **`powershell.exe`**: This indicates a PowerShell script is being executed.\n*   **`New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`**: This command attempts to create a new Windows service named \"objeto\\_ativo\". The crucial part here is the `-BinaryPathName`. It specifies the executable that will run when this service starts:  `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  **This is the most important piece of information!** You need to investigate this file immediately.\n*   **`Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`**: This command immediately starts the newly created service.\n\n**3. Service Lifecycle Events:**\n\nThe final events confirm that the service creation and startup was successful, shown by \"Engine Lifecycle\".\n\n**Analysis and Potential Risks**\n\n*   **Unusual Path:** The path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` is highly suspicious.  It is not a standard Windows path.  This strongly suggests a malicious actor attempting to hide their code.  `unidade_logico` likely translates to \"logical drive\" and is likely a drive other than C:.\n*   **Service Name:**  The service name \"objeto\\_ativo\" (Portuguese for \"active object\") is also suspicious.  Malicious actors often choose names that try to blend in but also might be related to their operation.\n*   **Hidden Malware:** The file `tarefa_logico.exe` is almost certainly malicious code. It's being executed as a Windows service, which means it will run silently in the background, even when the user is not logged in. It could perform a variety of malicious actions, such as:\n    *   Data theft\n    *   Ransomware encryption\n    *   Remote access and control\n    *   Lateral movement within the network\n* **Repeated Execution**: The repeated execution of this command suggests an attempt to ensure the service is created and started reliably, potentially to persist through reboots or system changes.\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:**  Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of the malware.\n2.  **Investigate `tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is the **highest priority**.  Scan the file with multiple antivirus engines (VirusTotal is a good resource).  Determine its purpose and origin.\n3.  **Delete the Service:**  Use the `sc delete objeto_ativo` command in an elevated command prompt to remove the malicious service.\n4.  **Scan the System:**  Perform a full system scan with reputable antivirus and anti-malware software.  Consider using a bootable rescue disk for a more thorough scan.\n5.  **Review PowerShell Execution History:**  Check the PowerShell execution history to see if there are other suspicious commands that were executed.\n6.  **Review User Activity:** Examine user activity logs to identify any unusual logins or actions.\n7. **Hunt for Lateral Movement**:  Search other machines on the network for signs of the same file or PowerShell command.\n\n**Prevention:**\n\n*   **Application Whitelisting:**  Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized executables from running.\n*   **PowerShell Restriction:**  Restrict PowerShell execution policies and script signing.\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Deploy EDR solutions to detect and respond to malicious activity.\n*   **User Education:** Train users to recognize and avoid phishing emails and other social engineering attacks.\n\n\n\nThis is a serious situation, and immediate and thorough action is crucial to mitigate the damage. I strongly advise engaging a cybersecurity professional to assist with the investigation and remediation."}
