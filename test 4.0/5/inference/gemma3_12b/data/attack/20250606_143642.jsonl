{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The script executed a series of PowerShell commands, demonstrating several malicious activities. Here's a breakdown of the events:\n\n**Initial Compromise & Download (Likely Preceding Events - Not in Log, but inferred):**\n\n* **`services.exe` Registry Value Set:**  This could be a component of the initial installation or setup phase, potentially modifying system services.\n* **`sppsvc.exe` Image Loaded & `taskschd.dll` File Loaded:** These suggest a potential use of the System Preparation Service (`sppsvc.exe`) to launch a scheduled task potentially to execute malicious code at a later time. This also indicates Task Scheduler has been leveraged.\n\n**Malicious Activities:**\n\n1. **`whoami.exe` Execution:**  The attacker executed `whoami.exe`, likely to gather information about the current user and their privileges.\n2. **`powershell.exe` - First Stage - File Removal:** The primary attack vector involved `powershell.exe`.  It immediately used `Remove-Item` to delete a file named `$env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory. This suggests the attacker downloaded a ZIP archive (`entrada_principal.zip`) previously and is now removing it, possibly to cover their tracks.  The `-Force` parameter removes the file(s) without prompting.\n3. **`powershell.exe` - Script Execution and Policy Test:**  After deletion, a new PowerShell script was executed (though the actual commands inside are hidden in the redacted parts).  The script wrote a temporary file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` to the user's temporary directory. This is a technique often used to bypass PowerShell script execution policies. The name strongly suggests it's testing the PowerShell execution policy to determine what's allowed and how to bypass restrictions.  The file was then immediately deleted, further indicating an attempt to evade detection.\n\n**Key Indicators of Compromise:**\n\n* **PowerShell Use:**  The attacker heavily relies on PowerShell, a common tool for malicious actors due to its flexibility and ability to bypass security measures.\n* **File Deletion:** The deletion of `entrada_principal.zip` and the temporary policy test script highlights attempts to remove traces of the attack.\n* **Temporary Directory Abuse:** The attacker leverages the user's temporary directory for both downloaded files and temporary scripts, making it a prime location for hiding malicious activity.\n* **PowerShell Execution Policy Test:** The creation and immediate deletion of a temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) indicates that the attacker is probing the system's PowerShell execution policies to determine how to execute further malicious commands.  This is a significant red flag.\n* **Leveraging System DLLs:** The numerous DLL loads within PowerShell executions (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) confirm the script is dependent on the .NET framework and may be employing advanced techniques.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* **Review Scheduled Tasks:**  Thoroughly inspect the scheduled tasks on the system to identify any suspicious entries created by the attacker.  Look for tasks related to `sppsvc.exe`.\n* **Check PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Review the PowerShell execution policies and ensure they are configured to prevent unauthorized script execution.\n* **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement PowerShell logging and auditing to track PowerShell commands and scripts executed on the system.\n* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Implement an EDR solution to detect and respond to malicious activity in real-time.\n* **Network Traffic Analysis:**  Analyze network traffic for any communication with suspicious IP addresses or domains.\n* **File Integrity Monitoring:**  Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to critical system files.\n\n\n\nThe attack is actively trying to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself. This points to a sophisticated attacker. Further investigation is highly recommended to determine the full extent of the compromise and prevent future attacks."}
