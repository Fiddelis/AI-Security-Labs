{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events describes a malicious PowerShell script execution and cleanup. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, with potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) and suggested next steps:\n\n**1. Initial Execution & Task Scheduler:**\n\n*   **`services.exe`** is present which is a benign process on Windows.\n*   **`taskschd.dll`** is loaded by `sppsvc.exe`. Task Scheduler is likely being manipulated.  This suggests the attacker might have used a scheduled task to initially trigger the script or subsequent actions.\n\n**2. PowerShell Execution & Deletion:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe`** is launched.  This is the main execution point for the malicious script.\n*   **`whoami.exe`**:  The script is first checking the current user.\n*   **`powershell.exe`**:  Malicious commands are executed.  The most critical line is:\n    *   `\"powershell.exe\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`: This command uses PowerShell's \"call operator\" (`&`) to execute another command.  The core action is `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`.  This is attempting to delete a ZIP file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory (`$env:Temp`).  The `-Force` parameter bypasses any confirmation prompts. **This is a strong indicator of cleanup activity. The attacker is trying to erase their tracks.**\n*   `Mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and other .NET related DLLs are loaded - The code uses the .NET Framework.\n*   `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` is loaded - related to PowerShell.\n*   A temporary PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted.  This likely helps to bypass PowerShell execution policies or to perform some other transient action.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **File Name:** `entrada_principal.zip` -  This file name is key to identifying potential malware samples.\n*   **Temporary File:** `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` â€“  The name suggests a PowerShell policy test, but is being used maliciously.\n*   **Registry Changes:**  The `taskschd.dll` and other registry event suggests Task Scheduler is being abused.\n*   **User Agent\/Hostname:**  The username `fiddelis`  needs to be checked against other logs and systems.\n*   **Process Lineage:**  Trace the parent processes of `powershell.exe` to see how it was initially launched.  Look for unusual or unexpected parent processes.\n\n**Possible Attack Scenario:**\n\n1.  **Initial Access:** The attacker likely gained initial access through a phishing email, exploit, or credential theft.\n2.  **Scheduled Task Creation:** The attacker created a scheduled task to automatically execute the PowerShell script.\n3.  **Payload Download\/Extraction (Likely Prior to Logs):**  The `entrada_principal.zip` file *likely* contained the payload of the attack.  The logs show an attempt to delete this file, indicating that the malicious code may have already been extracted and executed before the cleanup.\n4.  **Cleanup:** The attacker deleted the ZIP archive to remove traces of the download, showing clear evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendations & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Affected System:** Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further propagation.\n2.  **Analyze `entrada_principal.zip`:**  If possible, recover the deleted `entrada_principal.zip` file (if shadow copies or data recovery tools are available).  Analyze the contents to identify the specific malware.\n3.  **Review Scheduled Tasks:**  Thoroughly review all scheduled tasks on the affected system and other systems in the environment.  Look for suspicious or unexpected tasks.\n4.  **Check Task Scheduler History:** Examine the history of Task Scheduler to identify when suspicious tasks were created or modified.\n5.  **Forensic Analysis:**  Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system's hard drive.\n6.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Deploy or improve EDR capabilities to detect and respond to similar attacks in the future.\n7.  **User Education:** Educate users about phishing and other social engineering tactics.\n8.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Enforce strict PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n9.  **Monitor for Similar Activity:**  Monitor network traffic and system logs for similar activity on other systems in the environment."}
