This pattern is highly indicative of malicious activity such as malware installation or execution, potentially using `certutil` to obfuscate payloads. The presence of `powershell` and `cmd.exe` alongside `certutil` further supports this concern. The use of SDXHelper.exe also warrants closer inspection as it appears to be loading system DLLs.
