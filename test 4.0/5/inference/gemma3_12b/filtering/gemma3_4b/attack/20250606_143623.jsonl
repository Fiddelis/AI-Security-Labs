{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The logs indicate suspicious activity involving the creation and execution of a PowerShell script that creates and starts a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\". This service is linked to an executable file located at `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the significant events and why they are concerning:\n\n* **PowerShell Script Execution:** The core activity is the execution of a PowerShell script. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used for legitimate administrative tasks.  However, it's also a frequent tool for attackers due to its flexibility and ability to perform complex actions. The `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag attempts to limit script execution, but it can often be bypassed.\n\n* **Service Creation (\"objeto_ativo\"):**  The script creates a new Windows service. Services run in the background and have elevated privileges.  Malicious actors can create services to maintain persistence, hide malicious code, and perform actions with higher system access.\n\n* **Executable Link (`tarefa_logico.exe`):** The service's binary path (`tarefa_logico.exe`) is key. **This is the most critical element.**  It's unknown what `tarefa_logico.exe` does. The file path is also suspicious - it's not a standard Windows system file.  Its contents need to be examined *immediately*.\n\n* **Service Startup:** The script starts the newly created service, enabling it to run and execute whatever code is contained in `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n* **Final Result Output:** The repeated output of `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` suggests a check or confirmation stage within the execution process.\n\n**Severity: Critical**\n\n**Recommendations & Immediate Actions:**\n\n1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately disconnect the system from the network to prevent further communication and potential spread of the threat.\n2. **Identify `tarefa_logico.exe`:**\n   * **Locate the File:**  Find the `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` file.\n   * **Static Analysis:**  Submit the file to a reputable online virus scanning service (VirusTotal) and perform static analysis using tools like PEiD or strings.  Look for signs of packing, obfuscation, or unusual strings.\n   * **Dynamic Analysis (Sandbox):**  If safe, execute the file in a controlled sandbox environment to observe its behavior and identify any malicious actions.\n3. **Examine PowerShell Script:**  Analyze the original PowerShell script to understand the full scope of the actions being performed.\n4. **Check for Persistence:**  Look for other indicators of persistence beyond the service creation. Check scheduled tasks, registry keys (especially under `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`), startup folders, etc.\n5. **Review System Logs:**  Examine the Windows Event Logs (System, Application, Security) for any other related events, especially around the time of the script execution.  Look for unusual processes, network connections, or registry modifications.\n6. **Incident Response Plan:**  Activate your organization's incident response plan.\n7. **Determine Root Cause:**  How did this PowerShell script get executed? Was it a phishing attack, a compromised software installation, or a vulnerability in a system component?  Addressing the root cause is essential to prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nThis is a very serious situation that requires prompt and thorough investigation. The creation of a service linked to an unknown executable is a strong indicator of malware or unauthorized system modification."}
