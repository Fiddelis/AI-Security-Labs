Additionally, there's process creation involving cmd.exe using 'sc.exe' to create and start services, potentially indicative of persistence mechanisms or malware installation. The repeated registry value set events further suggest malicious modifications. The inclusion of .NET framework DLL loading also hints at potential exploitation or use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
