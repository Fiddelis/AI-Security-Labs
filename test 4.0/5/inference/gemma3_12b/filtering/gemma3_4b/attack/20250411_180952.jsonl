The addition of new users to the Domain Admins group and use of unusual names such as 'pacote_principal_Admin' are highly suspicious.  Several processes (chrome, powershell, cmd) have multiple network connections detected, which, while not inherently malicious, warrants further investigation in conjunction with the user creation events.
