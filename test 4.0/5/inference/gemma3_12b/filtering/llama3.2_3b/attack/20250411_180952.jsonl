The repeated usage of 'registro_temporario', 'unidade_temporario', and 'pacote_principal', 'unidade_comum', 'modulo_comum', 'modulo_logico' hints at a possible naming convention used by the attacker. Powershell is also frequently accessed. While `winlogbeat` and `svchost` are normal processes, their context alongside the other events warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
