These actions, combined with several other PowerShell events (image loading, file deletion, registry modifications), suggest potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or execution of a complex attack chain.  The naming convention of the zipped files (containing terms like 'pacote', 'objeto', 'tarefa') seems deliberate, potentially obfuscating the files' true purpose. The inclusion of `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` is suspicious as it indicates potential usage for downloading\/accessing web content.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
