{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log sequence indicates a potential malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown and assessment:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nA PowerShell script is executed.  It appears to be trying to remove a file named \"entrada_principal.zip\" from the temporary directory. It also uses .NET libraries. This script execution follows a period of other activity.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n1. **Initial Activity:**\n   - **`sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `taskschd.dll`**: These are legitimate Windows processes and DLLs. `sppsvc.exe` is related to Software Protection Service, `svchost.exe` hosts Windows services, and `taskschd.dll` is part of the Task Scheduler. This is normal Windows activity. The association with Task Scheduler is noteworthy because attackers often use the Task Scheduler to schedule malicious PowerShell scripts.\n   - **PowerShell Access:**  `powershell.exe` is accessed. This alone isn't malicious, as PowerShell is a legitimate tool for administration.\n\n2. **Malicious Command Execution:**\n   - **`whoami.exe`**:  This command is used to identify the current user. While not inherently malicious, it's often used by attackers to understand their foothold.\n   - **`powershell.exe` with `Remove-Item`**: This is the *key* malicious activity.\n     - **`powershell.exe`**: Invokes the PowerShell interpreter.\n     - **`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`**: This command attempts to delete a ZIP file named \"entrada_principal.zip\" from the user's temporary directory (`$env:Temp`). The `-Force` parameter suppresses confirmation prompts.\n       - **Suspicious File Name:** The file name \"entrada_principal.zip\" is *highly* suspicious.  \"Entrada\" means \"entry\" or \"input\" in Spanish. It suggests the file might be involved in an initial compromise stage (perhaps a dropper or an initial payload).\n       - **Temp Directory:**  Attempting to delete files from the temp directory is a common tactic of malware to clean up traces of its activity.  This suggests a deliberate attempt to evade detection.\n\n**Assessment & Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **File Name:** `entrada_principal.zip` - This file name is a strong indicator of malicious activity. Monitor for the presence of this file on other systems.\n*   **Command Line:** `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` - The exact command used to delete the file.\n*   **Temporary Directory Access:**  Malware often attempts to clean up after itself by deleting files from the temporary directory.\n*   **PowerShell Usage**: PowerShell is a common tool for attackers, and its use should be carefully scrutinized.  The complex command line usage is another sign of potential malicious activity.\n*   **.NET usage:** The use of `mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll` indicates the script is utilizing .NET functionality, which can be used for a wide range of activities, including obfuscation and exploitation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the affected system:**  Disconnect the system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by the malware.\n2.  **Scan with updated antivirus\/EDR:** Run a full system scan with an up-to-date antivirus or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution.\n3.  **Investigate the source of the PowerShell script:** Determine how the script was executed (e.g., Task Scheduler, email attachment, malicious website).\n4.  **Examine the contents of \"entrada_principal.zip\" (if possible):**  If the file is recoverable, analyze its contents to understand its purpose. **Do this in a safe, isolated environment.**\n5.  **Review Task Scheduler:**  Check the Task Scheduler for any suspicious tasks that may have been created or modified.\n6.  **Monitor Network Traffic:** Analyze network traffic for any unusual connections.\n7.  **Implement PowerShell Restrictions:**  Consider implementing PowerShell restrictions (e.g., AppLocker, Constrained Language Mode) to limit PowerShell's capabilities.\n8.  **User Education:**  Educate users about the risks of opening suspicious email attachments and visiting unknown websites.\n9.  **SIEM Correlation:**  Correlate this event with other events in your SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to identify potential patterns.\n\n\n\n**This log sequence strongly suggests a potential compromise. Immediate investigation and remediation are necessary.**"}
