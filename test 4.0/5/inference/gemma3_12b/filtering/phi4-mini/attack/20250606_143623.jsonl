{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The logs indicate a series of actions taken, primarily involving PowerShell scripting and service management. Here's a breakdown of the significant events:\n\n**1. Initial HTML\/XML Data (First Entry):**\n\n*   **Likely Source:** This appears to be some kind of formatted data (HTML\/XML, as indicated by the complex structure). It's not a traditional process execution. It's likely related to some reporting or configuration generation. It's too complex to fully parse without more context.  The presence of UUIDs and base64-encoded data suggests this is machine-generated and not easily human-readable. The `winlog` tag suggests it originated from a Windows system.\n*   **Key Takeaway:** This initial entry is an anomaly â€“ not a typical process execution, but a data transmission.\n\n**2. Service Creation & Startup (Multiple Entries):**\n\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe`\n*   **Command Line:** `powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}`\n*   **Description:** This sequence of commands creates a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" and immediately starts it.  The service's executable is located at `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  This is a *very* important sequence of events.  The name of the service and path to its executable are critical for further investigation.\n*   **`winlog` Tags:** These confirm these are lifecycle events (creation\/startup) within the Windows environment.\n\n**3. Final PowerShell Echo (Multiple Entries):**\n\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe`\n*   **Command Line:** `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`\n*   **Description:** This PowerShell command writes \"Final result: 1\" to the console.  The `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` indicates that the PowerShell execution policy is enforcing restrictions, but the command is still allowed to run. This suggests that the script has been authorized to bypass these restrictions.\n* **`winlog` Tags:** These confirm the event occurred within the Windows environment.\n\n**Overall Assessment & Potential Concerns:**\n\n* **Malicious Activity Indicator:** The creation and immediate startup of a service (`objeto_ativo`) with a custom executable (`tarefa_logico.exe`) is a *significant* red flag.  This is a common tactic used by malware to establish persistence.  Malware often creates services that run in the background and automatically restart if terminated.\n* **Persistence Mechanism:** The created service provides a mechanism for the malicious code to automatically launch on system startup, ensuring it remains active even after system reboots.\n* **Unknown Executable:**  The file `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` is the most critical piece of information.  It *must* be analyzed to determine its purpose.  It's highly likely to be malicious.  Upload it to a sandbox like VirusTotal.\n* **Bypass of Execution Policy:** The PowerShell commands bypassing the `Restricted` execution policy is a further indication of potentially unauthorized activity.\n* **\"Final result: 1\":** This could be a simple test result or some sort of reporting mechanism.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is the *highest* priority.  Upload it to VirusTotal and use other sandbox environments to thoroughly analyze its behavior.  Determine what it does and what resources it accesses.\n2.  **Disable or Delete the Service:** If `tarefa_logico.exe` is confirmed to be malicious, immediately disable and delete the \"objeto\\_ativo\" service.\n3.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:** Examine how the PowerShell execution policy was bypassed.  Look for any changes to the execution policy itself or for policies allowing execution of unsigned scripts.\n4.  **Investigate \"unidade\\_logico\":** The drive \"unidade\\_logico\" is worth examining. Determine the purpose of this drive.\n5.  **Scan the System:** Perform a full system scan with updated anti-malware software.\n6.  **Monitor for Similar Activity:** Implement monitoring to detect any further attempts to create or modify services.\n7. **Examine the source of the initial HTML data:** This might give clues as to the larger campaign involved.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based on the provided log data.  A full and accurate determination of malicious activity requires a more complete picture of the system and network environment.  Treat this assessment as a starting point for further investigation."}
