The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script file ('__PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1') is suspicious, often indicative of script execution attempts followed by cleanup to avoid detection. The repeated provider lifecycle events also warrant closer inspection, potentially signaling script execution or other PowerShell-related activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
