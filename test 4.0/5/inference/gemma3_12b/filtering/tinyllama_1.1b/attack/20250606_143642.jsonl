{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data indicates a PowerShell script execution chain, likely related to a security assessment or software installation check. Here's a breakdown of what the logs tell us, along with potential implications and areas for further investigation:\n\n**1. Initial PowerShell Execution (First Entry):**\n\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe`\n*   **Winlog Task:**  Process Create\n*   **Command Line:** A command line is provided including `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`\n*   **Implication:** The script started with a restricted execution policy.  The `Write-Host` indicates a deliberate output was generated. The \"Final Result: 1\" is a key piece of information - it suggests a test or condition was met.\n\n**2.  .NET Framework Loading:**\n\n*   Several entries indicate loading of .NET Framework DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`).\n*   **Implication:**  The PowerShell script is leveraging .NET Framework functionality. This is common, but increases the attack surface if vulnerabilities exist in the .NET runtime.\n\n**3. Temporary File Deletion:**\n\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe`\n*   **Winlog Task:** File Delete logged\n*   **File:** `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`\n*   **Implication:** This is *very* important. The script created a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) and then immediately deleted it. This is a common tactic to hide malicious activity by reducing the available evidence.  The name suggests a PowerShell Policy test was performed.\n\n**4. Second Script Execution:**\n\n*   **Process:** `powershell.exe`\n*   **Winlog Task:** Provider Lifecycle (repeated)\n*   **Command Line:** A significantly more complex PowerShell command line.\n    *   `$Res = 0;` Initializes a variable to 0\n    *   `$Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf');` Gets all `.inf` files in the Windows `inf` directory.  `.inf` files are often used for driver installation and other system configurations.\n    *   `foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { ... }` Loops through each `.inf` file.\n    *   `$Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName;`  Reads the contents of the current `.inf` file.\n    *   `if ($Data -match '\\\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]') { $Res = 1; break; }` This is the core logic. It searches the contents of each `.inf` file for a specific string (`\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]`).  If it finds that string, it sets `$Res` to 1 and exits the loop.\n    *   `Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`  Outputs the final value of `$Res`.\n\n**Interpretation and Potential Risks:**\n\n*   **System Information Gathering:** The second PowerShell script appears to be probing the system's `.inf` files to determine if certain installation features or architecture types are present.  This could be:\n    *   **Legitimate Software Installation Check:**  A legitimate software installer might check `.inf` files to ensure compatibility with the system.\n    *   **Reconnaissance:**  A malicious actor could be gathering information about the system's configuration to identify vulnerabilities or plan an attack.  They may be checking for drivers, architecture, or specific installation patterns.\n*   **Obfuscation:**  The use of temporary files and a complex command line is an attempt to obfuscate the script's purpose.\n*   **PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass:** The initial execution policy was set to restricted. This may indicate an attempt to execute code that would normally be blocked. The initial command `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` could be a simple test to confirm PowerShell is able to run with restricted policy.\n\n**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Contents of the `.inf` files:**  Analyze the contents of the `.inf` files in `C:\\Windows\\inf` to understand why the script is searching for the specific string.\n2.  **Determine the Source of the PowerShell Script:**  How did the PowerShell script originate? Was it downloaded from a website, received as an email attachment, or created by a user?\n3.  **Analyze Network Connections:**  Check for any unusual network connections made by `powershell.exe` around the time of the script execution.\n4.  **Monitor PowerShell Activity:**  Implement PowerShell logging and monitoring to detect future suspicious activity.\n5.  **Scan for Malware:** Perform a full system scan with a reputable antivirus\/anti-malware program.\n6.  **Review User Activity:** Examine the user's (fiddelis) activity around the time of the script execution.\n\n\n\n**Crucially, the deletion of a temporary PowerShell script is a significant red flag and should be investigated thoroughly.**  It's highly probable that this script is related to a reconnaissance or potential attack."}
