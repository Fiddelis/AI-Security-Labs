The use of `sc.exe` to create a service with a custom executable, along with subsequent registry modifications and image loads for .NET related DLLs, strongly indicates possible persistence mechanisms or malicious code execution.  While some events appear benign (notepad.exe, winlogbeat), the overall pattern warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
