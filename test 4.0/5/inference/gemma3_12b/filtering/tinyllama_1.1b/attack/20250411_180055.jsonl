The compressed files use consistent naming conventions ('elemento_temporario.zip', 'modulo_comum.zip', etc.) across different paths, which is suspicious.  The repeated use of `Compress-Archive` coupled with file deletion events, and the presence of a RuntimeBroker event point towards potential data exfiltration or malicious activity using PowerShell.  The loading of PowerShell modules ('Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive.psm1') supports the use of archive functionality.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
