The script includes the `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms` command which is often used for screen capture and UI automation. The creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1`) alongside events like 'Pipe Created' and 'Remote Command Execution' further suggest potential malicious activity, such as reconnaissance or data exfiltration.  The 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks indicate the script is actively running and potentially manipulating system components.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
