{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. The goal is to determine if the entire set is interesting or not for investigation. I'll start by going through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to system processes and normal activities. For example, there's a lot about files being created or loaded, services logging on, and user account management tasks. These types of events are common in Windows logs and usually don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nOne event that caught my attention is the use of `powershell.exe` with an Execution Policy set to Restricted. The command line shows it's checking for specific .inf files and looking for a particular pattern. This could be indicative of malicious activity, as PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting tasks. However, in this case, the script seems to be checking for certain INF files that might relate to drivers or other system components. While unusual, it's not immediately clear if this is malicious.\n\nAnother point is the repeated events from `services.exe` and `taskhostw.exe`. These are legitimate Windows processes, so their activity alone isn't concerning unless they're doing something out of the ordinary. There's also a lot of User Account Management tasks, which again are normal for system operations like logins or profile updates.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created under the EdgeUpdate directory, specifically `setup.exe`. This might be part of an update process, but sometimes malicious software uses legitimate processes to execute harmful code. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this setup.exe is malicious.\n\nLooking at all these events together, while there are a few that could potentially be suspicious on their own, the overall batch doesn't present a clear pattern of malicious activity. The PowerShell command might warrant closer look but without additional indicators like network traffic or known malicious file hashes, it's hard to classify this batch as definitely interesting.\n\nI also notice that some events have null process names, which is normal for certain types of logs and doesn't add any concern here.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'd say the batch is somewhat on the edge but not definitively concerning. Therefore, I would classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no strong evidence of malicious behavior when looking at the entire set.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system processes and activities, such as file creation, image loading, and user account management. While some entries like PowerShell commands could be suspicious, there's insufficient evidence to suggest malicious behavior in the given batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything unusual. The user provided 19 JSON events, each representing a log entry. My task is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating further.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since winlogbeat is likely an agent that logs system activities. The next events are from svchost.exe setting registry values, which is standard because svchost runs various services and often interacts with the registry.\n\nThe fourth event is Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon is a common DLL for URL handling, so that doesn't raise flags. Next, another svchost process creates something related to Delivery Optimization; I've heard that's part of Windows Update, so it's expected.\n\nThen there are events from MsMpEng.exe and other processes like CompatTelRunner loading taskschd.dll. Those seem normal too—taskschd is for task scheduling. \n\nI notice multiple instances where svchost.exe creates files in the NetworkService profile. That could be concerning because svchost running as LocalSystem shouldn't typically access user profiles, especially under NetworkService. Maybe it's related to some service configuration or a potential exploit.\n\nLooking at MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a file: usually updates download and then install, so deleting might not be malicious. However, the path seems long, which could indicate an update package being handled correctly.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe events are from Windows Defender. They create temp files and load DLLs, which is normal for scans. The last few events involve conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values—those are terminal emulators, so their activity doesn't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events are standard system activities. However, the multiple svchost.exe file creations under NetworkService might be a red flag. If svchost is acting异常ly here, especially creating files in user profiles, it could indicate malware or unauthorized access. The repeated actions from the same process might warrant closer inspection.\n\nSo, considering all events, there's at least one area that stands out—svchost.exe activity—which makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in user profiles may indicate potential unauthorized access or suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple JSON objects, each representing an event. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file information. \n\nLooking at the first two events:\n- The process name is \"MpCmdRun.exe\", which is associated with Microsoft's Defender Antivirus. The task is about an image being loaded, specifically MpClient.dll and MpCommu.dll. These are legitimate files part of Windows Defender, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThe third event has nulls in all fields, which might be a system log entry that doesn't capture any specific action—probably not relevant for our analysis.\n\nNow, the majority of the events (from the fourth onwards) involve \"git.exe\" creating various files. The paths are all within a user's directory, specifically under \"node_modules\/semver\". This looks like someone is working on a Node.js project, possibly installing or updating dependencies using npm. The creation of multiple .js files in the semver package suggests normal development activity.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes normal system processes (Windows Defender) and typical user activities related to software development. There's no indication of unusual behavior, such as unauthorized access, unknown executables, or signs of malware. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem to require further investigation from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate system processes and user activities related to software development with git.exe and Node.js packages.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of log events where the process name is git.exe each time, and the task is a File Created event. The file paths all point to different JavaScript files under node_modules\/semver on a user's system.\n\nFirst, I recognize that semver is a popular npm package used for semantic versioning. Node_modules is the standard directory in Node.js projects where third-party packages are stored. Git.exe is typically used for version control, so it makes sense when cloning or updating repositories that it would interact with files in node_modules as part of the installation process.\n\nEach event creates a file like major.js, minor.js, etc., which are all parts of the semver package. This looks normal because when you install or update packages using npm, git might clone the repository and create these files. The internal files like constants.js also seem typical for a well-structured Node module.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, locations outside node_modules, or indicators like deleted\/renamed system files. All paths are within the expected structure for a development environment using Node.js and npm.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, they fit the pattern of standard npm package installation via git. There's no reason to suspect anything out of place here. It doesn't raise any red flags related to security incidents or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal file creation activities by the git process during npm package handling, indicating standard development operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is something I should be interested in. So, looking at each event, they all have the same process name: git.exe. The task is a \"File created\" event under the rule FileCreate. Each event points to a different file within the node_modules\/semver directory.\n\nHmm, okay, so semver is a package related to semantic versioning in Node.js. I know that when you install npm packages, especially globally or if you're working on a project, the files get downloaded and extracted into the node_modules folder. So these events look like they're part of normal npm operations—installing dependencies, perhaps.\n\nEach file path is specific to semver's internal modules. The filenames like parse-options.js, re.js, package.json, etc., are standard for JavaScript packages. They include various utility files and configuration, which makes sense during an install or update process.\n\nConsidering the user context, the path is under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads... That suggests it's a local development environment, maybe someone working on their S206 - Qualidade de Software project. So this seems like routine file creation by git.exe as part of npm package setup.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here—nothing related to known malware processes, unusual file paths, or suspicious tasks. It's all within expected behavior for a development environment using Node.js and Git.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events are probably just normal operations during the setup or update of npm packages. No red flags or indicators of compromise detected.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation activities by git.exe during normal Node.js package setup, which is typical and expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nAll the events have the same process name: git.exe. The task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means it's about a file being created. The file paths all point to different locations under node_modules in a directory named S206 - Qualidade de Software, which seems to be a course or project folder.\n\nLooking at the files being created, I see node_modules with packages like serialize-javascript, set-blocking, and set-function-length. These are all npm packages, so it looks like someone is installing Node.js modules. The files include standard package files (like package.json), READMEs, licenses, and some configuration files like .eslintrc and .nycrc.\n\nSince git.exe is involved in file creation, maybe this is part of a Git repository setup or during a clone operation where files are being created locally. The directory structure under node_modules suggests that these could be dependencies for a project, possibly related to software development quality tools given the course name.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. All the file creations are typical when setting up a Node.js project or installing dependencies. There's nothing like access to restricted files, unusual process names, or unexpected locations that would raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, while the events are normal for someone working on a software project using Git and npm, they don't indicate any suspicious behavior. So, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard file creation activities related to Node.js module installations during project setup, which is normal and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. All these events are in JSONL format, meaning each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" \n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of these events. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file-related data.\n\nThe process name in all cases is \"git.exe,\" which tells me that Git is being executed on the system. The Windows task is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate),\" indicating that a file was created. This rule might be part of some monitoring or security tool's configuration to track file creation events.\n\nLooking at the files being created, all paths start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\...\\...\". The directory structure suggests that this is related to a course on software quality. The specific files are various node modules like \"set-function-length\" and \"shebang-command,\" along with their associated package.json, README.md, LICENSE, etc.\n\nI notice that each event corresponds to the creation of a different file within these node_modules directories. For example, Git is creating multiple files under \"node_modules\/set-function-length\" such as index.js, package.json, etc., and similarly for other modules like shebang-command and shebang-regex. \n\nGiven that all these events involve the same process (git.exe) creating standard files associated with Node.js modules, it seems like this could be part of a normal software development workflow. When someone is using Git to clone or initialize a repository, especially within a project directory, Git might create these files as part of the repository setup or during an npm install operation.\n\nThe user's directory path includes \"node_modules,\" which is typical in Node.js projects where dependencies are stored. The presence of package.json and README.md files further supports this as they're standard in such projects. Since all events involve creating files under a user's Downloads folder, it doesn't seem unusual unless there's specific context about the user's activity that I'm missing.\n\nI should consider whether these activities could indicate malicious behavior. Malware or attackers often create or modify files in unexpected locations or use certain processes to hide their tracks. However, Git is a legitimate tool used for version control, and creating node_modules is part of installing dependencies, which is common in development environments.\n\nAnother angle is the frequency and volume of these events. If this were a single event, it might not raise flags, but having multiple consecutive file creations under the same directory could be concerning. However, in this case, all events are part of the same process (git.exe) creating necessary files for a project setup. There's no indication of unusual file paths or access times that would suggest an anomaly.\n\nI also think about whether these actions fall outside normal user behavior. If \"fiddelis\" is a legitimate user and this activity is happening during their work on software quality projects, then it's entirely expected. Without signs of privilege escalation, writes to system directories, or other red flags, there's little reason to suspect foul play.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows Git creating multiple files in what appears to be a standard Node.js project setup. This doesn't deviate from normal user activity, especially if the user is a developer working on their projects. Therefore, while it's good to log such activities for auditing purposes, there's no evidence of malicious intent or security incidents here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activity by Git during a Node.js project setup.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, looking at each JSON object, they all have the same process name: git.exe. The task in winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the files being created are various .json, .md, .js, and other extension files within a node_modules directory.\n\nFirst, I remember that when developers work with Node.js, they often use git for version control. So it's common to see git.exe creating files in the repository. The paths like \"node_modules\" indicate this is part of a JavaScript project setup.\n\nThe files being created include package.json and readme.md, which are standard in npm packages. There are also test directories and configuration files like .eslintrc and .nycrc, which are typical for development projects to manage linters and coverage tools. The presence of multiple files with different extensions suggests a normal setup process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, paths that seem suspicious, or activities outside the norm for someone setting up or updating a Node.js project. All these events look like part of a git repository being cloned or updated, which is a regular occurrence in development environments.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch of logs doesn't raise any red flags.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object with information about a file creation by the git.exe process. The paths all lead to different files and subdirectories within \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\".\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events are from the same process, git.exe, which is commonly used for version control in software development. The task being logged is \"File created\", so each event represents a file or directory being created on the filesystem.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under node_modules, which is typical when someone is working with Node.js packages. Each entry seems to be part of different modules: signal-exit, slice-ansi, sshpk, etc. These are likely dependencies of a project that's being set up or updated using npm.\n\nThe events include the creation of standard files like package.json, README.md, LICENSE.txt, index.js, and also some development-related files like .travis.yml and Jenkinsfile. The presence of these files suggests that this is part of a normal software development workflow—maybe someone is cloning a repository, initializing it, or installing dependencies.\n\nI'm wondering if there's anything unusual here. Since all events are related to the same process creating standard project files in a typical location (node_modules), it doesn't seem suspicious. There's no indication of any malicious activity like access to unexpected files, attempts to execute binaries outside the expected scope, or signs of data exfiltration.\n\nAnother thing I consider is the frequency and number of events. While there are several file creations listed, they're all part of the same operation (installing node modules), which is a common occurrence during development. If this were a one-time event for a user who's not typically using git or npm, it might be more interesting, but given the context provided, it seems routine.\n\nI also think about possible false positives. Sometimes, legitimate activities can look suspicious if they occur outside of normal patterns, but in this case, everything aligns with expected behavior when setting up or managing a Node.js project.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no evidence of malicious intent here.

Each one has a \"process\" field where the name is \"git.exe\". Then there's a \"winlog\" field indicating that a file was created, with the rule being \"FileCreate\". The \"file\" field shows different paths, but they all point to various locations within a folder structure related to Node.js modules. For example, one path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\strip-final-newline\\readme.md\", and others are similar but different files in the same directory.\n\nHmm, so I'm noticing a pattern here. All events involve git.exe creating files. The paths all lead to node_modules, which is a standard folder in Node.js projects where third-party libraries are stored. Each event corresponds to a file being created, like package.json, index.js, license, etc. These are typical files you'd expect to find when installing modules using npm or yarn.\n\nNow, considering the context of git.exe creating these files: Git is often used for version control, but in this case, it's part of the process for setting up a Node.js project. When someone clones a repository that includes node_modules, sometimes the files are created as part of the setup. Alternatively, if someone is installing dependencies using npm within a git repository, these events would naturally occur.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The activities described are normal when working with Node.js modules and version control systems. There's no indication of unusual file creation times, access to restricted files, or attempts to execute code that doesn't fit the standard workflow. All the paths are within a user's Downloads folder, which is a common location for projects.\n\nIt's also possible that these events are part of an automated process, like a CI\/CD pipeline setting up dependencies in a new environment. Such processes would create multiple files in node_modules as they install each package and its associated files.\n\nSince all the events fit within normal project setup activities and there's no evidence of any malicious behavior or anomalies, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\".

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, the user has given a batch of JSONL events and wants me to determine if they're interesting or not based on the entire batch.\n\nLooking at the events, each one has three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which makes sense because Git is often used for version control and can create files when cloning repositories or during operations like fetch or pull.\n\nThe task in the winlog is consistently \"File created\" with a specific rule mentioned. That tells me these are file creation events, nothing malicious at first glance since it's standard for Git to create files during its operations.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, they all point to node_modules directories, specifically under \"inatel\/S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Node modules are where npm packages and their dependencies are stored. The files include .js, .d.ts (TypeScript definition), package.json, README.md, etc., which are typical for a node_modules structure.\n\nI'm noticing that each event is creating a different file within the same directory. For example, one creates index.d.ts, another index.js, and so on. This pattern suggests that Git is cloning or updating a repository, and as part of that process, it's extracting these files into the correct location.\n\nSince all events are related to file creation by git.exe in a node_modules folder, which is standard for npm packages, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious activity here. There's no unusual process names or file paths that stand out as suspicious.\n\nHowever, I should consider if such a batch could indicate something else. For instance, sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools like Git for lateral movement or data exfiltration. But in this case, the files being created are all standard npm packages and their associated files. There's no execution happening here; it's purely file creation.\n\nAlso, considering the number of events—15 lines—all related to the same operation (cloning a repository), it's plausible that this is part of a legitimate software development process. The user might be working on a project that uses Node.js and Git, so these events are expected during setup or updates.\n\nI should think about confidence levels. Since everything aligns with normal Git and npm behavior, the confidence in this being non-malicious is high. But to be thorough, I wonder if there's any chance these could be part of a broader attack where Git is used as a vector. However, without more context or events showing unusual access times, failed operations, or other anomalies, it's hard to justify classifying this as interesting.\n\nIn summary, each event is normal for someone using Git and npm in their workflow.

The specific files being created are various JavaScript files inside the tcomb library.\n\nSo, to break this down, each event shows that git.exe is creating a file in a particular path. Given that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially with Node.js projects, it's not unusual for it to create or update files within node_modules. The paths like C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\... suggest that this is part of a development environment where someone is working on a project using tcomb, which I believe is a type-checking library for JavaScript.\n\nLooking at the batch as a whole, all these events are sequential and seem to be part of a normal installation or update process. The files being created are standard parts of a Node.js module, so this activity aligns with typical development workflows. There's no indication of any unusual behavior, such as multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or inconsistencies in the file paths that might suggest tampering.\n\nI also consider whether there's any sign of malicious activity here. Since all actions are under a user's control (fiddelis is the username), and the files being created are expected components of a Node.js module, there's no red flag indicating an attack or unauthorized access. The consistent process name and task type further support that this is benign activity.\n\nIn cybersecurity, it's important to look for anomalies or deviations from normal behavior. Here, everything seems within the norm for someone developing with Node.js and using git for version control. There's no evidence of unexpected processes, file accesses outside expected areas, or other indicators that would raise suspicion.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these events together, I conclude that this batch doesn't indicate any malicious activity. It's just part of a developer's routine work with their project.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during development, specifically within the node_modules directory, which is expected in a Node.js environment. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events. Each one is a JSON object with the same structure: process name is git.exe, task is File created, and the file path points to various .js files inside a node_modules directory. The paths all follow a similar pattern under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\".\n\nSo, I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, git.exe creating files in node_modules makes sense because when you run npm install or similar commands with Git, it's common for the process to interact with these directories. The files being created are all JavaScript libraries, which aligns with typical development activities.\n\nSince all events show the same pattern of file creation by git.exe in a standard location related to a project's node_modules, there doesn't seem to be any unusual behavior here. No signs of unexpected processes or access patterns that might indicate malicious activity. It looks like normal development operations.\n\nTherefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting for further investigation as it fits expected activities without any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory, indicating normal development activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I've been given a bunch of JSONL events where the process is git.exe and each event indicates that a file was created in specific paths under node_modules\/tcomb\/lib. The files created are things like isNumber.js, isString.js, etc.\n\nHmm, first, I need to determine if this batch is interesting or not for investigation. Since all events involve git.exe creating these files, maybe it's related to some Git operation. But wait, why would git.exe create multiple files under node_modules? That seems a bit odd because normally, node_modules are managed by npm or yarn, and Git wouldn't be involved in that process unless someone is using a Git hook or something.\n\nBut wait, could this be part of a legitimate activity like installing dependencies or running scripts? If a user is setting up their environment, they might clone a repository which includes these files. But the fact that all these specific .js files are being created by git.exe might raise an eyebrow. I'm not sure if Git typically creates those kinds of files as part of its normal operation.\n\nAlternatively, could this be a sign of malicious activity? Maybe someone is trying to inject or replace files in the node_modules directory using Git for some hidden purpose. Or perhaps it's part of some automated process that shouldn't involve writing to node_modules directly via Git.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether multiple file creations in quick succession under a module directory is normal. It might be during a build process, but usually, npm handles that, not git.exe. So this combination seems unusual and possibly suspicious.\n\nSo putting it all together, while each individual event might look innocent on its own, the fact that they're all coming from git.exe and targeting files in node_modules could indicate something fishy is going on. Therefore, I think the batch should be classified as interesting because it doesn't align with typical user behavior or standard processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory suggest potential unusual activity that may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
