{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for shipping logs, so that seems normal—it’s probably setting up its configuration file.\n\nNext,mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE are both setting registry values. MMC is the Microsoft Management Console, often used to manage system settings, so this might be part of legitimate operations. The same goes for Explorer.EXE—registry writes are common during startup or configuration changes.\n\nThen there's a bunch of events related to powershell.exe. The first few are about process creation and image loading. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad, so I need to look closer. The command line is just the default path, so nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nLooking at the file paths in ImageLoad tasks: mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll—these are all part of the .NET framework andclrjit.dll which is also a legitimate component. So these seem normal.\n\nThere's a series of events labeled \"Provider Lifecycle\" from powershell.exe. Providers in Powershell handle data sources like Active Directory or Registry, so this could be part of standard operations but might indicate some scripting activity.\n\nThen there's a file creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1 in the Temp directory. This name looks like it's from a script policy test. Powershell often creates temporary files when scripts run, especially if they're testing policies or configurations. The fact that it was created and then deleted might not be malicious but could indicate some automated process.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events, which powershell uses for communication between processes, so again, this is normal unless there's a known bad script using it to communicate with other processes.\n\nLastly, loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. These are legitimate files related to the antivirus software, so no issues here.\n\nPutting all this together: The batch shows a lot of activity around Powershell, which can be concerning because it's a tool often used in attacks. However, each individual event doesn't point to malicious behavior—like creating temporary files and deleting them is normal for script testing. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might suggest some automation or script execution but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't too high because there are red flags with Powershell activity, especially the creation and deletion of a script file in Temp. However, considering that these actions could be part of legitimate system administration tasks or automated scripts, I'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING but with some uncertainty.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows normal system activities such as file creation, registry updates, and legitimate Powershell operations without indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell is a common tool but can also be used maliciously, so that's a red flag. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal since it's likely the log agent itself writing logs or configuration files. The path looks standard too, in the user's downloads directory with a .winlogbeat.yml extension, which I think is part of the setup for winlogbeat.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file named teste.ps1. Creating new scripts can be innocent, but given that it's paired with other events from powershell, this might warrant closer look. Then, again, winlogbeat.exe creates another file at the same path as before. So, two separate instances of creating files by different processes.\n\nThen, there's a Registry value set event for powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate script execution but are also often used in attacks to maintain persistence or change system configurations maliciously.\n\nLooking further, there's a Process Create event where powershell is launched with the command line showing \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\". That's concerning because using Bypass allows scripts to run without the usual policy restrictions. This is commonly exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n\nAnother event shows Process Access for powershell.exe, which could indicate that another process is interacting with it—maybe injection or some form of communication.\n\nMultiple Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree, clrjit, etc., are standard as part of Powershell's operation. However, sometimes attackers might load malicious DLLs or use these to execute code.\n\nThen there's a File Create event for a temporary script in the user's Temp directory and immediately after, that file is deleted. This behavior—creating and then deleting a script quickly—is often used by malware to avoid detection. The naming __PSScriptPolicyTest seems like it might be testing if scripts are allowed to execute, which could indicate an attempt to bypass restrictions.\n\nAnother File Create event for a profile data file under the Startup folder might suggest that the attacker is trying to create persistence mechanisms in Windows, allowing malicious scripts to run at startup.\n\nLastly, there's an Execute Remote Command event without details. This can be dangerous as remote commands can lead to unauthorized actions or execution of arbitrary code.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe events, including script creation and execution with bypassed policies, file deletions that might cover tracks, registry modifications which could be for persistence or privilege escalation, and the use of temporary files quickly deleted. These are all signs of potentially malicious activity. While some events might not be suspicious on their own, the combination—especially the ExecutionPolicy Bypass and remote command execution—raises significant red flags.\n\nI'm pretty confident that this batch is worth investigating further. The activities described could indicate an attack in progress or a successful breach where attackers are establishing persistence and trying to hide their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including execution with bypassed policies, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and remote command execution suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
