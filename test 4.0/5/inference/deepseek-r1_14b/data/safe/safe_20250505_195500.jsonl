{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Let me start by understanding each event.\n\nFirst, most events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" and the task is \"File created\". The files being created are in a specific path: \"C:\\Users\\...\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...\". It seems like these are JavaScript files with varying hashes in their names. There's also one event where the process name isn't specified, but it's still a file creation task.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar. I think it might be related to Office solutions or perhaps some kind of package installer. These events show multiple .js files being created, which could indicate that an application is deploying its resources. Since all these files are in the same directory and named similarly, it's likely part of a normal installation process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file paths or suspicious processes. The repeated creation of JS files might be during an update or initial setup. Also, one event doesn't have a process name, which could mean it's from the system account or another legitimate source.\n\nSo overall, these events seem normal for an Office-related package installation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of JSONL Events:**\n\n- **Process Name:** Majority of events are associated with \"SDXHelper.exe\", which is likely related to Microsoft Office Solution Packages.\n  \n- **Task Type:** The task consistently shows as \"File created\", indicating file creation activities.\n\n- **File Details:** Files being created are JavaScript (.js) files located in a specific directory.

There is no evidence suggesting unauthorized access or malicious activities."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system events. So, the user provided a series of log entries where the same process, \"SDXHelper.exe\", is creating multiple files in a specific directory under the \"Office\" application data folder. Each event is a file creation with different filenames that follow a pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by various hexadecimal strings.\n\nFirst off, I notice that all events are from the same executable and happen in the same path. This repetition suggests it's part of a normal software operation rather than malicious activity. Typically, applications create temporary or configuration files during setup or runtime, which would explain multiple file writes.\n\nThe filenames include \"strings.min\" which makes me think these might be string resource files used by the application. The varying hex strings could be unique identifiers or version numbers appended to each file. It's common for software to generate such files as part of initializing settings or caching data.\n\nLooking at the process name, \"SDXHelper.exe\", I'm trying to recall if this is a known legitimate tool. A quick mental note—yes, there's an application called SDX (SFX) related to software packaging and deployment. It might be used in deploying Office add-ins or custom software components. So, it makes sense that this helper process would create several files during its operation.\n\nAnother point to consider is the location of these files. They're stored under \"%ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Office\", which is a standard directory for application data and settings. Legitimate applications often use this path for storing configuration or cache files accessible by all users.\n\nI also check if there's any indication of suspicious behavior, such as file names that seem random or unrelated to the process name. Here, all files follow a predictable naming convention, which is typical of legitimate operations rather than potential malware trying to hide files with random names.\n\nMoreover, the fact that each event is just a file creation without any other actions like deletion or modification soon after makes me lean towards normal behavior. Malicious processes often perform more complex operations beyond simple file writes, and they might do so across different directories or with less predictable naming conventions.\n\nLastly, considering the frequency of these events—multiple entries in the log—they could represent an installation process or a routine update where several files need to be set up. Since all actions are confined to one specific directory and involve known types of files for this application, there's no red flag indicating suspicious activity.\n\nIn conclusion, after evaluating the process name, file locations, filenames, and typical behavior patterns, it appears these log entries are part of a legitimate operation by the SDXHelper.exe process during its normal functioning. There doesn't seem to be any indication of cybersecurity threats or malicious activities here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events in this batch indicate that `SDXHelper.exe` is creating multiple files in the directory `%ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Office`. Each event shows the creation of a file with a name following the pattern `officeaicopilot-strings.min*`, where `*` represents varying hexadecimal strings. This suggests that `SDXHelper.exe` is generating several configuration or resource files during its operation.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process Name**: The process `SDXHelper.exe` might be part of a legitimate software, possibly related to Microsoft Office or a helper application.\n2. **File Creation Pattern**: The files being created follow a predictable naming convention, which is consistent with normal application behavior.\n3. **Location**: The directory `%ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Office` is a standard location for storing application data and configurations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis batch of events appears to be part of the normal operation of `SDXHelper.exe`, likely related to configuration or initialization processes. There are no indicators of malicious activity in these events."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to figure out if this entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the events, each one is in JSONL format, meaning each line is a separate JSON object. The first thing I notice is that almost all of these events are coming from \"SDXHelper.exe\". There are 14 entries here, and out of those, two are from \"chrome.exe\". So, most of the activity seems to be tied to this SDXHelper tool.\n\nEach event under SDXHelper shows a file creation operation. The files being created have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" which suggests they might be part of an Office add-in or some related software. The locations where these files are being created are all within the same directory: \"C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\\OfflineFiles\\\".\n\nNow, I need to think about what's normal here. It's common for applications, especially those that are plugins or extensions, to create temporary or configuration files in such locations. Office apps often use these OfflineFiles directories for storing data that can be accessed when online. So, the creation of these files might just be part of the application's standard operation.\n\nThe two entries from chrome.exe show a \"Registry value set\" task. That could mean Chrome is adjusting some settings or extensions in the registry. Again, this doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's something unusual about how it's interacting with the system.\n\nI should consider whether these activities align with known behaviors of SDXHelper and Chrome. If SDXHelper is a legitimate tool used by the organization for managing Office applications or providing certain functionalities, then its activity might be expected. The same goes for Chrome – setting registry values could be part of its extension management or update processes.\n\nHowever, I also need to think about indicators of compromise (IoCs). Are there any unusual file names or paths here? The filenames seem consistent with a naming convention that includes hashes or version numbers, which is typical for cached strings in Office add-ins. There's no evidence of known malicious file names or paths here.\n\nAnother angle is the volume of activity. Creating multiple files in quick succession could be a sign of something amiss, but if this happens during an update or a bulk operation, it might not be suspicious. Given that there are 14 entries, spread across different filenames and times (assuming each event has a timestamp), it's hard to say without more context whether this volume is normal.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies in the process IDs or parent processes if available. If these events were linked to known malicious processes or if the files were created by unusual executables, that would be concerning. But from what's provided, the events are linked to standard executables like chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe.\n\nAdditionally, I might look into whether these files are being accessed or modified again shortly after creation. If they're immediately deleted or used maliciously, that could indicate an issue. However, without more data on file operations beyond creation, it's hard to assess this.\n\nIn summary, the activities described seem to be part of normal application behavior, specifically related to Office and Chrome. There's no clear evidence pointing towards malicious intent based on the provided logs. Therefore, unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise, this batch doesn't appear to be particularly concerning from a cybersecurity perspective.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the system log events indicates that the activities described are within normal operational behavior for the applications involved. The creation of files by SDXHelper.exe and modifications by chrome.exe align with typical processes for Office add-ins and browser operations, respectively. There is no evidence of malicious activity or indicators of compromise in the provided logs.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"not_interesting\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events. Each event is from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The action logged is \"File created\" under the rule \"Microsoft Windows Security Center\", which typically monitors and reports on system health and security.\n\nThe files being created all have similar names, starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by different hexadecimal strings. These are located in a path that includes \"PackageResources\", suggesting they're part of an application package.\n\nI notice there are multiple entries for each file. For example, \"6e8677412ec1c52d6c8de740536c0080.js\" appears twice. This duplication makes me think it's either the system trying to create the same file repeatedly or maybe normal behavior depending on context.\n\nSince all events are from the same process and involve creating files in a package resource directory, this could be part of a legitimate application's setup. However, since I'm not familiar with \"SDXHelper.exe\", I should check if it's known for such activity.\n\nIf \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with malware or suspicious behavior, these repeated file creations might indicate malicious activity like dropping files or creating temporary resources. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate process handling multiple resources as part of its operation.\n\nGiven the uniformity in the file names and locations, my initial thought is that this isn't malicious but perhaps part of an application's normal setup. However, without more context on what \"SDXHelper.exe\" does or the broader system activity, it's hard to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process and Action:** Each event involves the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating a file under the rule related to Windows Security.\n\n2. **Analyze File Paths and Names:** The files are in the \"PackageResources\" directory, suggesting they're part of an application package.\n\n3. **Check for Repeated Entries:** Multiple entries create the same files, which could be normal if the process expects to recreate resources or suspicious if it indicates persistence.\n\n4. **Research Process Name:** Determine if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate or malicious process.\n\n5. **Determine Legitimacy:** Based on research, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with trusted software, these events are likely normal. If linked to malware, they may indicate issues.\n\n6. **Consider Context:** Look at other system activities and logs to assess overall system health and security posture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe repeated file creation by \"SDXHelper.exe\" in the specified directory is likely part of a legitimate application's setup process unless there are additional indicators suggesting malicious activity. Further investigation into the nature of \"SDXHelper.exe\" would be recommended for definitive analysis."}

The process is \"SDXHelper.exe\" and each event involves creating a JavaScript file in a specific path. The files have unique hashes but the same base name pattern.\n\nFirst, I think about what SDXHelper.exe does. It could be legitimate software or potentially malicious. Since it's creating multiple JS files quickly, it might be caching data or generating some content on the fly.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all under a common directory: C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c3... etc. This suggests that these files are part of an Office add-in or component. The GUID-like string (8c3...) is common in such contexts.\n\nThe frequency of file creation might indicate normal operation, especially if the software updates or generates temporary files. However, creating so many files in a short time could be suspicious if it's beyond what's expected for legitimate use.\n\nI check each file name: they all follow a pattern with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" and a unique hash. This makes me think these are likely JavaScript modules being loaded or cached by the application. Since the same process is creating them, it could be part of how Office handles different language packs or features.\n\nI also consider if this activity aligns with known behavior of SDXHelper.exe. If I'm unsure, looking up online might help determine if others have reported similar logs and whether they were normal or signs of malware.\n\nSince all events are file creation without deletions, it doesn't seem like a persistence mechanism is being used here. The files don't appear to be executed elsewhere either.\n\nIn conclusion, while the repeated file creations could look concerning, they fit within typical behavior for an Office-related process handling multiple language strings or features. Without additional signs of malicious activity, this likely isn't suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe logs indicate multiple instances where the `SDXHelper.exe` process is creating JavaScript files in a specific directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, the user provided a log with multiple entries where an executable named SDXHelper.exe is creating several JavaScript files in a specific directory. Each entry shows that a different file is being created, all under the same path.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe does. It might be a legitimate tool or something malicious. Legitimate software sometimes logs activity by creating temporary files, but if it's writing multiple files quickly, that could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all have the pattern \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_XXXX.js\". The varying parts after \"min_\" are likely random identifiers. This makes me think that each time SDXHelper.exe runs, it creates a new JS file with a unique name. If this process is happening frequently or in large numbers, it could indicate some kind of loop or repeated execution.\n\nI wonder if these files are being used for something malicious, like part of a payload delivery or persistence mechanism. Sometimes, attackers use legitimate tools' behaviors to hide their activities. Alternatively, it could be that SDXHelper.exe is part of an Office add-in or plugin that's supposed to generate some resources on the fly.\n\nAnother angle is checking if these files are being executed or just written. If they're just data files and not run as scripts, the risk might be lower. But if the JS files contain executable code, especially obfuscated or malicious code, that could pose a threat.\n\nI should also consider the volume of these files. The user provided 14 entries, which might indicate a pattern over time. If this activity continues, it could lead to issues like filling up disk space or causing performance problems on the system.\n\nTo get more clarity, I think running a process monitor tool would help track what SDXHelper.exe is doing in real-time. Checking its file operations and network activities could reveal if it's communicating with external servers or downloading additional components.\n\nAnother step would be to analyze one of these JS files. Opening them might show if they contain any suspicious code or references to known malicious domains. If they're benign, like configuration files for an Office tool, that would lower the concern level.\n\nI should also look into whether there are any recent updates or changes on the system where this started happening. Maybe a new software installation introduced SDXHelper.exe as part of its setup.\n\nLastly, checking the system's overall health—antivirus scans, disk space, process activity—is important to ensure nothing else is amiss that could be related.\n<\/think>\n\nBased on the provided log entries, it appears that the `sdxhelper.exe` process is creating multiple JavaScript files in the directory `%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\\strings.min_`. Each file has a unique identifier after the \"min_\" prefix and ends with \".js\". \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process Name**: The process responsible for these operations is `sdxhelper.exe`.\n2. **File Creation**: The process is creating multiple JavaScript files in a specific directory.\n3. **Pattern**: Each file follows the naming convention `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<unique_identifier>.js`.\n\n### Possible Explanations:\n1. **Legitimate Software**: It could be part of a legitimate software, possibly related to Office add-ins or plugins that generate temporary files for functionality.\n2. **Malicious Activity**: The process could be malicious, potentially dropping multiple files as part of a payload delivery or persistence mechanism.\n\n### Steps to Investigate Further:\n1. **Process Monitoring**: Use tools like Process Monitor (Procmon) to track the activity of `sdxhelper.exe` in real-time.\n2. **File Analysis**: Inspect the contents of these JavaScript files to determine if they contain any suspicious code or payloads.\n3. **Correlation**: Check for additional logs or activities on the system that correlate with the execution of `sdxhelper.exe`.\n4. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic to see if `sdxhelper.exe` is communicating with external servers or downloading additional components.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the provided information does not definitively confirm malicious intent, the pattern of behavior could warrant further investigation. It's advisable to analyze these files and monitor the system for any unusual activity that may indicate a security threat."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system event. My task is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth looking into from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each entry one by one to understand what's happening. The first few events are all from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in the same path: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" with various .js file names. This seems repetitive, but I'm not sure yet if it's normal or suspicious.\n\nI notice that each entry has the same process name and task type, so they're all file creation events from the same source. The files created are JavaScript files with long hashes in their names. That makes me think these might be some kind of cached resources or perhaps part of an application's setup files. I'm wondering if this is typical behavior for SDXHelper.exe.\n\nThen there's a middle entry where \"chrome.exe\" creates a temporary file: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\ad71f2ea-b333-47d3-90de-05df187121c9.tmp\". Temporary files created by browsers aren't unusual, especially with random names like this. It could be a download that's incomplete or being processed.\n\nAfter that, the events continue again with more file creations from SDXHelper.exe, each time appending different .js files to the same path. The repetition makes me think these might be part of an update process or perhaps something related to themes or extensions within Office applications since they're in a SolutionPackageResources directory.\n\nNow, considering cybersecurity, I'm on the lookout for signs of malicious activity. Some red flags could include unknown processes creating files, especially if they're attempting to write to restricted areas or using uncommon file types. However, SDXHelper.exe is something I've heard about before—it's related to Microsoft Office add-ins and extensions. So it's more likely a legitimate process.\n\nThe files being created are .js, which are scripts, but in this context, within an application package, they're probably part of the application's functionality rather than malicious scripts. The temporary file from Chrome is also benign since browsers often create such files during operations like downloads or caching.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether these events are happening at a frequency that's normal. Since there are 14 entries in total and most are from the same process creating multiple small files, it might just be part of a legitimate update or cache refresh. Unless there's an unusual spike in activity beyond what's typical, this doesn't seem concerning.\n\nI should also check if the file paths are writable by the application. The path for SDXHelper.exe is within the user's AppData directory, which is standard for applications storing user-specific data and settings. Temporary files in Downloads from Chrome are expected too.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), there aren't any obvious ones here like writes to system directories, creation of executable files, or changes to sensitive system configurations. All the files are confined to their application's respective directories.\n\nI might wonder if these files could be used in a供应链攻击 (supply chain attack) if they're part of third-party libraries within Office add-ins, but without more context on the content of the .js files, it's hard to say. However, given that this is just an event log and not the actual file contents, there's no immediate cause for alarm.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple instances of a legitimate process creating expected types of files in standard locations, with one normal browser-related activity in between. No signs of unauthorized access or malicious behavior detected here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is not considered suspicious from a cybersecurity perspective. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**: The repeated creation of .js files by SDXHelper.exe appears to be part of legitimate operations, likely related to Microsoft Office extensions or add-ins. These are standard actions within application-specific directories.\n\n2. **Chrome Temporary File**: The temporary file created by chrome.exe is normal browser behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n3. **No Signs of Malicious Behavior**: There are no indicators of compromise such as writes to restricted areas, creation of executables, or changes in system configurations. All activities are confined to expected directories.\n\n**Conclusion**: These events represent typical legitimate operations by known processes and do not suggest any cybersecurity threats."}

Each line represents a file creation event by the same process, \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files being created are all JavaScript files located in the same directory within the Office package.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are 16 entries, each with identical information except for the filename. This repetition suggests a pattern of multiple file creations occurring at regular intervals or as part of a larger process.\n\nI'm considering whether this activity is normal or suspicious. SDXHelper.exe could be a legitimate tool related to Office, perhaps used for updates or package management. However, given that all files are .js and located in an \"Offline Files\" directory, it's worth investigating if these files are part of expected updates or something else.\n\nI'm thinking about the possibility of file hashing to check for malicious content. If these JavaScript files have known hashes associated with malware, this could be a sign of compromise. Alternatively, if they're legitimate updates, they might not pose a threat.\n\nAnother angle is checking the user account under which SDXHelper.exe is running. If it's running with elevated privileges and writing to unexpected locations, that could raise red flags.\n\nI also consider the timing of these events. Are they happening at unusual times, such as outside business hours? The frequency of file creation might indicate automated activity, which isn't necessarily malicious but worth monitoring.\n\nIn summary, while there's no immediate evidence of malicious intent here, it's crucial to verify the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe and the files it's creating. Checking for known hashes, user permissions, and understanding the normal behavior of this process within the environment are next steps.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows multiple file creation activities by \"SDXHelper.exe\" in an Office package directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the logs, most of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData folder. The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" and have different hashes as extensions. That makes me think these could be temporary or cached files from an Office add-in or some similar application.\n\nThen, there are a couple of logs from \"chrome.exe\". One sets a registry value, which isn't unusual for Chrome when it updates settings or preferences. The other two entries show that Chrome is loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are standard operations as part of the browser's functionality.\n\nI'm wondering if there's anything suspicious here. SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate tool used by Microsoft for Office, so its file creation activity doesn't raise red flags on its own. Chrome's actions also seem normal unless they're deviating from usual behavior, which they don't appear to be.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity? Not really. No signs of unexpected registry changes or unusual files being written. The repetition in the filenames suggests it's part of a cache or update process rather than something nefarious.\n\nSo overall, these logs look like standard operations from legitimate software processes. Without more context indicating otherwise, I wouldn't flag them as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events is not particularly interesting for investigation. Here's why:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**: The majority of the logs show \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData folder. These files appear to be temporary or cached files related to an Office add-in or similar application, as indicated by the filenames starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\".\n\n2. **Chrome.exe Activity**: The logs from \"chrome.exe\" show normal operations for a web browser:\n   - Setting a registry value, which is typical for configuration updates.\n   - Loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are standard operations for a running browser.\n\n3. **No Indicators of Suspicious Activity**: There are no signs of malicious behavior in the logs. The repetitive naming pattern of files created by SDXHelper.exe suggests legitimate caching or update processes rather than anything nefarious.\n\n**Conclusion**: These logs represent typical activities from legitimate software processes and do not indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this JSONL data with multiple events to analyze. Let me go through each one and see if there's anything interesting.\n\nLooking at the first event: chrome.exe loading a Microsoft Defender file. That seems normal because Defender is a legitimate process. No red flags here.\n\nNext are two events from SDXHelper.exe creating files in Office's SolutionPackages directory. These look like they're part of the Office setup or updates, so probably not malicious. But I should keep an eye on how many there are and if the paths seem standard.\n\nThen, three chrome.exe events setting registry values. Again, this could be normal for a browser adjusting settings. Not suspicious unless it's doing something unusual in the registry.\n\nAnother SDXHelper event creating another file. Same as before; seems part of Office operations.\n\nA few more chrome.exe events involve file streams and Zone.Identifier, which are related to handling downloads. When you download a file from the internet, Windows marks it with a zone identifier to help with security decisions. The multiple file stream creations might be due to how Chrome handles the file upon download.\n\nThere's also a DNS query event from chrome.exe, which is standard for browsing and accessing domains.\n\nLooking through all events, I notice that some actions are repeated, like multiple FileCreate events by SDXHelper.exe and several FileCreateStreamHash and RegistryEvent entries from chrome.exe. This repetition could be normal if it's part of legitimate operations, but it might also indicate something more concerning if these processes are behaving abnormally.\n\nI should check if the file paths are legitimate.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from \"EXCEL.EXE\". It looks like Excel is loading various DLL files. The tasks include Image loaded and File operations. That seems normal because when an application starts, it loads several libraries. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating some files in the Office Solution Packages directory. Those paths look legitimate, probably part of Microsoft Office updates or add-ins. I don't see any signs of malicious file creation here.\n\nNext, I see multiple Registry value sets from \"svchost.exe\". Svchost is a common system process used by services, so this is normal activity. It's not unusual for services to update registry values during their operation.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and sequence, Excel is both creating and deleting a file named \"~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\". The tilde prefix usually indicates a temporary file created when opening a document in Excel. The creation and deletion of this file within the logs could be part of normal operations, especially if someone is editing the file and then closing it.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event from Excel. Named pipes are used for interprocess communication, which is standard behavior for applications needing to communicate with other processes or services.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or activities that don't align with typical user behavior. The events seem consistent with normal operations of these processes without any anomalies that would raise red flags.\n\nSo, putting it all together, everything in the logs appears to be within the expected range for a system running Excel and other legitimate processes.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first line: It's an event where \"HxTsr.exe\" set a registry value. That might be normal depending on what HxTsr.exe does. I should check if that's a known process related to legitimate software or not.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in various paths. The file paths seem long and specific, under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. The filenames look like JavaScript files with hashes at the end. These could be resource files for Office add-ins or language packs. Since they're being created by an Office-related process, this might just be normal behavior.\n\nThen, there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" creating temporary files and loading images. These include both regular file creation and image load operations, which are typical for Excel when handling documents and loading necessary DLLs. The paths like \"Zone.Identifier\" suggest they're dealing with files that have zone information, possibly related to security settings or downloads.\n\nI also notice that many events are duplicates, like multiple FileCreate tasks from SDXHelper.exe creating the same file path. This repetition could indicate a legitimate process, perhaps during an update or language pack installation, rather than malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, these logs seem to show normal operations of Microsoft Office processes setting up their environment and handling files. There's no indication of unusual behavior like access to restricted areas, unexpected file creation in system directories, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate a breach.\n\nTherefore, after considering each event and the context provided by the process names and file paths, I don't see any red flags that would make these logs interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events does not appear to be particularly concerning from a cybersecurity perspective. The activities described are consistent with typical operations performed by Microsoft Office-related processes, such as setting registry values, creating files for language resources, and loading necessary image libraries. There is no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious behavior in the provided logs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"interesting\": false,\n    \"details\": \"The log events show normal operations of Microsoft Office processes, including file creation and registry modifications, without signs of suspicious activity.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}

The user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if the batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first two entries are from \"winlogbeat.exe\" and \"SDXHelper.exe\", both creating files. These seem normal since winlogbeat is likely capturing logs, and SDXHelper might be related to Office packages handling offline files.\n\nNext, there's a lot of repetition with the same file paths being created by \"SDXHelper.exe\". This could indicate an issue or it might just be how the software operates during updates. But seeing multiple identical events might raise a flag if done excessively.\n\nThen, I notice several events where \"Explorer.EXE\" and \"EXCEL.EXE\" are setting registry values. These activities alone aren't suspicious; programs often interact with the registry. However, the frequency is something to consider. There are nine instances of EXCEL setting registry values, which seems a bit high for typical operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they point to recent files and Office package resources, which doesn't suggest malicious activity. The lack of other event types like process creation or network connections makes me lean towards benign behavior.\n\nConsidering all events together, while some repetition is normal, especially with software updates or configuration changes, the volume might warrant closer monitoring but isn't immediately concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation and registry activity related to system processes and Microsoft Office operations.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from Excel.exe setting registry values multiple times. Then there are some entries where process is null and winlog task is None. Finally, there are two events involving SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths.\n\nHmm, I know that applications like Excel often interact with the registry to store settings or configurations. So seeing EXCEL.EXE making registry changes isn't unusual on its own. In fact, it's pretty common for legitimate software to do that during operation.\n\nThe batch has a lot of repetitive events—like 20+ entries all from Excel setting registry values. That repetition might not raise any red flags because some applications perform the same operations regularly as part of their normal functioning.\n\nThen there are three entries where process is null and winlog task is None. These don't provide much information, but they also aren't indicative of malicious activity. They could be system-related events or perhaps log noise.\n\nThe last two events involve SDXHelper.exe creating files in a specific path. I'm not exactly sure what SDXHelper.exe does, but since it's related to Microsoft Office Solution Packages and OfflineFiles, it seems like part of the legitimate software ecosystem. The paths mentioned look like standard locations where such packages would store their resources.\n\nI should consider whether these actions are within normal operational parameters for these processes. Since Excel is a common application and its activities are well-documented, repeated registry writes aren't suspicious unless they're outside expected patterns. Similarly, SDXHelper.exe creating files in those specific paths seems like standard behavior for Office's add-ins or offline functionality.\n\nPutting it all together, there doesn't seem to be any evidence of malicious intent across the batch. The events are either normal application behaviors or system logs that don't indicate foul play. There's no sign of unusual access patterns, writes to unexpected locations, or other red flags typically associated with cyber threats.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because none of the events suggest malicious activity. My confidence in this classification is high, so I'd rate it at 0.9.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate application behavior with Excel modifying registry values and SDXHelper.exe creating files as part of normal operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. They're in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that most of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files. Specifically, they're creating JavaScript files in various locations under the user's AppData directory related to Microsoft Office Solution Packages. The paths look like standard locations where software might store resources or language-specific strings for UI elements.\n\nThen there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" performing DNS queries for different domains, including some that seem legitimate but also a couple that stand out as suspicious. For example, the query for \"microsoft.com\" is expected, but \"google.com\" and especially \"hxx[.]p10.link\" (which looks like a shortened URL) raise flags. Shortened URLs are often used in phishing or malicious activities because they can hide the true destination.\n\nI also notice that some of the events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" involve creating files with long hashes in their names, which might be unique identifiers but don't necessarily indicate anything suspicious on their own. However, combined with the DNS queries to potentially malicious domains, this could suggest a broader pattern of activity that's worth investigating.\n\nAnother point is the frequency and repetition of these events. The \"SDXHelper.exe\" creates multiple files with similar naming conventions, which might be normal for software updates or resource downloads. But again, paired with the suspicious DNS lookups, it could indicate an attempt to download malicious content or communicate with command-and-control servers.\n\nI should also consider the user context. If this activity happened during a time when the user was performing legitimate tasks, like using Office applications, then some of these actions might be expected. However, if there's no clear justification for accessing those specific domains or creating those files, it could be malicious.\n\nIn summary, while individually the file creation events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" don't seem suspicious, the DNS queries to potentially harmful domains and the repetitive nature of the activity could indicate a security concern. This combination makes the batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe entire batch is deemed **interesting** due to the presence of suspicious DNS queries alongside standard file creation activities.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **File Creation by SDXHelper.exe:** The events show \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating several JavaScript files in known Microsoft Office resource directories. These seem legitimate, possibly part of software updates or language pack installations.\n\n2. **DNS Queries from Excel.exe:** \n   - Legitimate queries to \"microsoft.com\" and others are expected.\n   - Suspicious queries to domains like \"google.com\" and \"hxx[.]p10.link\" (a shortened URL often used maliciously) raise concerns about potential phishing or malware communication.\n\n3. **Repetitive Activity:** The repeated creation of files with long hash-like names, combined with the DNS queries, suggests a pattern that could be part of malicious activity, such as downloading content from unknown domains.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of legitimate file operations and potentially harmful network activities makes this batch worthy of further investigation to ensure there's no underlying security threat."}

Each event is a JSON object and the same process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" appears in all of them. The task logged is \"File created\", which means it's related to file creation events.\n\nThe files being created are located under various language-specific folders like en-us, es-es, etc., within the OfflineFiles directory. These seem to be localized strings for different languages, which makes me think they're part of a software application that supports multiple languages.\n\nI'm wondering if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office or another Microsoft product because the file paths and names look like parts of an Office installation. I should check online to confirm what SDXHelper.exe does. If it's a known component, then these events are normal and not suspicious.\n\nLooking at the number of events—14 in total—it seems they're all part of a single process creating multiple files quickly. That could be legitimate during an application update or initial setup, but it might also indicate something malicious if this process isn't supposed to create so many files rapidly.\n\nI should consider whether the creation of these specific files is expected behavior. If Office or another program uses localized strings stored in separate files per language, then this activity would be normal. However, if SDXHelper.exe is unknown and not related to a recognized software, it could be a sign of something malicious like malware dropping files.\n\nAnother angle is the user account under which these files are being created. If they're running with elevated privileges, that might raise a red flag because creating many files quickly can indicate a potential exploit or data exfiltration.\n\nI should also check the timestamps of these events to see if they occurred in quick succession, which could be another sign of malicious activity versus legitimate operations that happen over time.\n\nIn summary, while the process name and file creation tasks are common, the specific localized strings and volume might indicate either normal behavior or potential threats.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this query where the user provided a bunch of logs. Each log entry seems to be from an event where \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in specific locations under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out what's going on here. The common thread is that all these events are file creation events by the same process, SDXHelper.exe. This might be part of a legitimate update or installation process for Microsoft Office, as it's creating various JavaScript files and icons in different languages (like id-id, en-us, etc.). These could be localized resources for the software.\n\nBut wait, is there anything suspicious here? Well, if this activity is happening without user interaction, especially in large volumes or at unusual times, that might raise a red flag. However, given that each file path seems structured and follows a predictable naming convention, it's more likely part of normal operations. Microsoft Office updates often involve deploying these types of files.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of this being related to malware. Some malicious activities do create numerous files quickly, but in this case, the naming conventions are consistent with standard resource files for software applications. There's no indication of encrypted or obfuscated file names, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAnother angle is checking if these files were downloaded from trusted sources. Since they're located under the Microsoft Office directory and named after language codes, it points towards legitimate localization files being updated or installed.\n\nI might also think about whether this activity correlates with any known vulnerabilities or attack vectors related to SDXHelper.exe. A quick mental note: I don't recall specific threats tied to this process off the top of my head, but it's always good to keep an eye out for recent security advisories.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to be cautious, the information provided doesn't strongly indicate malicious activity. It looks more like standard operations by Microsoft Office components. However, if there were additional signs like unusual file sizes, execution logs, or deviations from normal patterns, that would warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe data you provided shows multiple log entries indicating that the process `SDXHelper.exe` is creating files in the directory `%ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`. This could be part of legitimate operations performed by Microsoft Office components to update or install certain resources.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **File Creation Events**: Each log entry indicates a file creation event.\n2. **Process Name**: The process responsible for these events is `SDXHelper.exe`.\n3. **Locations and Files**:\n   - The files are being created in the directory `%ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`.\n   - File names include various JavaScript (`*.js`) and icon (`*.svg`) files, as well as localization strings (e.g., `id-id-ui-strings-json`).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Legitimate Activity**: These entries could be part of a legitimate update or installation process for Microsoft Office components. The presence of localized resource files suggests that this might be related to language packs or other locale-specific resources.\n- **Malicious Indicators**: There is no clear indication of malicious activity in the provided data. However, if you suspect something unusual, additional investigation would be necessary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs appear to show legitimate file creation operations performed by `SDXHelper.exe`.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's start by analyzing each event and seeing what patterns emerge.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in the same path but different language-specific JSON files. These seem repetitive, with some files being created twice. For example, \"it-it-ui-strings-json_db31d8ed8da6ede686f40face8f6c2e7.js\" is created twice. This repetition makes me think these are normal operations, possibly part of an application's setup or language pack installation.\n\nNext, there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" performing a DNS query and modifying the registry. These actions seem standard for applications that might access online resources or configure settings during runtime. Excel is known to perform DNS lookups for updates or online services, so this isn't unusual unless it's accessing unexpected domains.\n\nLooking at \"svchost.exe\", which is a common system process, there are multiple events of registry modifications. These could be legitimate activities since svchost often handles various Windows services that require registry changes. However, I should consider whether these operations are within expected parameters for the running services.\n\nThere's also an event with null values in \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". This might indicate a system-level logging issue or incomplete data, but it doesn't provide actionable information on its own.\n\nPutting this all together, most of these events look like normal operations. The repetitive file creations by SDXHelper.exe are likely part of an application's initialization or update process. EXCEL.EXE's DNS query and registry changes fit typical behavior for such applications. Svchost.exe's activities align with system processes handling configurations.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like unexpected file accesses, writes to unusual locations, or anomalies in the timing or frequency of events. There are no failed operations or errors that would raise a red flag. The repetitive nature suggests background tasks rather than user interaction.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor logs for anything out of the ordinary, these entries don't indicate any security concerns or interesting activity worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events analyzed primarily consists of normal operational activities without indications of suspicious behavior. Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by SDXHelper.exe**: Multiple instances show the creation of language-specific JSON files, which likely pertain to application setup or language packs. Repetition is typical and not concerning.\n\n2. **EXCEL.EXE Activities**: DNS queries and registry modifications are standard for applications accessing online resources or configuring settings, fitting expected behavior.\n\n3. **svchost.exe Registry Modifications**: As a common system process, these events align with normal service configurations and aren't unusual unless parameters deviate.\n\n4. **Null Event**: Likely an incomplete log entry or system logging issue, providing no actionable insights.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events are consistent with typical application and system operations, showing no signs of malicious activity or anomalies. No further investigation is necessary based on this data."}

That seems a bit unusual but maybe part of normal Office setup? I'm not certain if this is malicious or not, so I'll note that as something to watch.\n\nThen, most of the events are from EXCEL.EXE setting registry values multiple times—19 times! That's a lot. Excel modifying the registry isn't typical behavior because it's more common for system processes or third-party apps to do that. So frequent writes could be suspicious; maybe trying to create persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nPutting all together: two file creations and many registry changes. The volume of registry writes is concerning, so I think this batch is interesting enough for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'EXCEL.EXE' setting registry values and a file creation event from 'SDXHelper.exe' may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple events where the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the task is a \"Registry value set\". This happens several times—like 7 entries. Registry modifications can be tricky because legitimate software often does this for configuration purposes. However, malicious actors might also use registry changes to persist or modify system settings. I wonder if seeing multiple such events in a row from Excel is normal. Maybe Excel updates some registry values when it runs, but having seven of them in a batch could be worth looking into.\n\nNext, there's another set of events where the process is \"SDXHelper.exe\". These are file creation events pointing to various JavaScript files within the Office Solution Packages directory. The paths seem legitimate, like Kok-in-ui-strings and others. I'm not familiar with what SDXHelper does exactly, but it sounds like a helper tool for Microsoft Office. The repeated creation of these JS files might be part of normal operations, especially if they're related to UI strings or language packs.\n\nI should consider whether these activities are baseline behavior or if there's something unusual. For the Excel events, I know that legitimate processes can modify the registry, but multiple writes in a short time could indicate something else. Maybe it's related to Office 365 or updates being installed. As for SDXHelper.exe creating JS files, if this is part of standard operations, then maybe it's not suspicious.\n\nI don't see any signs of immediate compromise—like processes running with elevated privileges or writes to unexpected locations. The Excel registry changes could be normal, especially during setup or updates. Similarly, the JS files created by SDXHelper might be part of Office's language support or UI customization features.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards these events being non-malicious. They don't trigger any red flags for me right now. But it's always good to cross-check with known behaviors and maybe look up if others have reported similar log entries as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe analysis of the provided log events indicates that they are likely non-suspicious, based on their alignment with normal software operations.\n\n1. **Excel Registry Modifications:** The seven events involving \"EXCEL.EXE\" modifying the registry could be part of legitimate configuration activities, such as updates or installations. While multiple writes can sometimes be suspicious, in this context, they appear to be within expected bounds for Excel's operation.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe File Creations:** The file creation events from \"SDXHelper.exe\" point to standard locations and files associated with Microsoft Office UI strings and language packs. These actions are consistent with typical operations of an office suite tool, especially related to language support or updates.\n\n**Conclusion:** No immediate signs of malicious activity were identified. Further investigation is not necessary unless additional indicators of compromise emerge."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. All the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events involve \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files. There are multiple entries where the same process creates different files with various paths. The file paths all point to locations within the Office Solution Packages, specifically under OfflineFiles. The filenames vary but seem to be language-specific, like \"ms-my-ui-strings-json\" or \"mr-in-ui-strings-json\". This suggests they might be localized resource files for different languages.\n\nThere's also one event where \"ms_MY\" is creating a file, which probably stands for Malaysian or another regional variant. That makes me think these are part of Microsoft Office's language packs or localization resources.\n\nAnother thing to note is that each file creation seems repetitive. The same process creates the same files multiple times. I wonder if this is normal behavior during an update or installation. It might be that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is part of a legitimate software setup, downloading and extracting these localized strings as part of an update.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like unauthorized access or unusual file paths. All the actions are under the Office directory, which is expected for such helper processes. There's no indication that these files are being executed or modified in a way that would cause harm.\n\nHowever, I should consider if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process. A quick check tells me it's associated with Microsoft Office and used for updating or managing language resources. So the file creations are part of normal operations.\n\nThe one exception is the event where \"ms_MY\" creates a file. But since that's within the same structure, it doesn't raise any red flags. It might just be another instance of the helper process setting up localized content.\n\nIn summary, all these events seem to be legitimate actions taken by \"SDXHelper.exe\" during normal operations, specifically related to managing language resources for Microsoft Office. There's no evidence here that points towards malicious activity or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events involves \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating multiple files within the Microsoft Office directory. These files are localization resource files, each named with different language codes (e.g., \"ms-my\", \"mr-in\"). The repetitive nature of these file creations suggests they are part of a legitimate process, likely during an update or installation of language packs for Microsoft Office. \n\nSince all actions occur within expected directories and involve known legitimate processes, there is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe events are not indicative of suspicious or malicious behavior. They represent normal operations associated with updating or managing language resources in Microsoft Office."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs that were provided. The events are in JSONL format, and each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, let me parse the individual events to understand what's happening here. Each event has three main components: process details, Windows log information, and file path information.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process name: SDXHelper.exe\n- Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\nb-no-ui-strings-json_[hash].js\n\nThe second and third events are almost identical, with the same process name and task, but slightly different file paths:\n- Second event has ne-np-ui-strings-json_b754f06fbc4336a5d5ce70e8a18358e8.js\n- Third event repeats the second one.\n\nSo, all three events are from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, and they're all creating files in a specific location under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names look like JavaScript files with some language codes (nb-no and ne-np) and hashes as filenames.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about what SDXHelper.exe is. From my knowledge, this might be part of the Microsoft Office suite or related software, possibly used for handling updates or package resources. The fact that it's creating multiple files in OfflineFiles suggests these could be cached files for offline use in the office application.\n\nLooking at the justification required: I need to determine if this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Interesting would mean something unusual, potentially malicious, whereas not interesting means normal activity.\n\nIn this case, all events are file creation tasks by a legitimate process (SDXHelper.exe). The file paths point to standard locations within Microsoft Office's data structures. There's nothing here indicating any unauthorized access or suspicious behavior. It seems like the system is operating normally, with the Office software caching some resources for offline use.\n\nSo, considering all this, there doesn't appear to be any signs of malicious activity in these logs. They're just standard file creation events from a known process within a legitimate application directory.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the SDXHelper.exe creating files in a Microsoft Office-related directory, which is normal behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
