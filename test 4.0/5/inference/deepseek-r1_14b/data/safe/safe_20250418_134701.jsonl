The winlog task indicates that a file was created, and the file paths are all under the node_modules folder of a Cypress project, specifically within lodash's type definitions.\n\nI remember that Git can generate a lot of events when it clones repositories or updates submodules. Since these files are part of the Cypress types for Lodash, they're likely being created during a normal development process—maybe someone is setting up or updating their project dependencies.\n\nThere’s nothing here suggesting any malicious activity like unusual file creation times, writes to unexpected locations, or execution attempts.

The presence of node_modules suggests that this might be part of a Node.js project setup, which would include packages like Cypress and lodash. The creation of these .d.ts files could be part of the build process or during an npm install command, where TypeScript definitions are generated.\n\nLooking at all the events together, it's a series of file creations by git.exe in a typical development environment. This doesn't immediately raise any red flags because such activity is common when setting up or modifying a project that uses Git and Node.js dependencies. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, multiple failed attempts, or other anomalies that might suggest malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting the number of files being created in quick succession. While this could be part of a legitimate process like an initial clone or setup, it's also possible that something is iterating over these files for another purpose. But without more context, such as timestamps indicating rapid-fire writes or other suspicious attributes, it's hard to classify this batch as anything beyond standard development activity.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are typical in a software development setting, especially with tools like Git and Node.js.

The user has provided a batch of JSONL events, each indicating that the git.exe process created a file within a node_modules directory. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what these events represent. Each event shows a file creation by git.exe in a path that includes \"node_modules\" and \"cypress\". Node_modules is a common folder in JavaScript projects where dependencies are stored, especially with tools like npm or yarn. Cypress is a popular testing tool for web applications.\n\nSo, the user is likely running some form of development environment, possibly using Git for version control and Node.js with Cypress for testing. The creation of multiple files under node_modules by git.exe could be part of normal operations when installing or updating dependencies. For example, if someone is running `npm install` or `yarn add cypress`, this would trigger file creations in that directory.\n\nI need to consider whether such activities are unusual or indicative of malicious behavior. In cybersecurity, we're often looking for deviations from baseline activity. However, in this case, all events are consistent with legitimate software operations. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, strange file paths, or indicators of compromise like executing scripts or connecting to external domains.\n\nAdditionally, the same process (git.exe) is creating multiple files in a predictable location. This doesn't raise red flags.

My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event: It mentions \"git.exe\" creating a file in a specific path under the \"node_modules\" directory, specifically within \"cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\". The filename ends with .d.ts, which I know is a TypeScript declaration file. These are usually auto-generated and part of normal development processes.\n\nI notice that all the events have the same process name: git.exe. And each event reports a \"File created\" task under Windows log rules. The file paths are all within the node_modules folder, which makes me think this is related to a project using npm or yarn for package management. Node modules are typically where third-party libraries and their types are stored.\n\nSince these files are part of the Cypress testing framework (as indicated by \"cypress\" in the path), it's likely that someone is working on a project using Cypress.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events where each line represents an event from system logs. My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. The output should be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the individual events. Each event has three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file info. The process name is always \"git.exe\". The task in the winlog is \"File created\", so it's about files being created. The file paths are all under a user's Downloads folder, specifically within a course named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The subfolders go into node_modules, cypress, types, lodash, and various .d.ts files.\n\nI notice that each event is creating a different file in the same directory. For example, one creates \"startCase.d.ts\", another \"startsWith.d.ts\", and so on. Since all these events are happening under the same parent folder and created by git.exe, it seems like they're part of the same process. \n\nWait, what's git.exe doing here? Usually, git is used for version control. The presence in a node_modules folder suggests that this might be related to a development environment, maybe someone is setting up or updating their project dependencies.\n\nThe files being created are .d.ts files, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These typically define interfaces and types without implementation, often generated by other tools like TSD or during the build process of TypeScript projects. So, when git.exe creates these files, it might be part of a script or build process that generates these declarations.\n\nNow, considering whether this is interesting for investigation. Since all events are related to file creation in a development environment and are part of the node_modules structure, they don't seem suspicious on their own. It's common for development tools to create or update files during installations or builds.\n\nHowever, I should think about possible malicious activities. Could git.exe be used maliciously? In some cases, attackers might abuse legitimate tools like git for command execution or lateral movement. But in this case, the actions are purely file creations within a project's node_modules directory, which is standard behavior when installing or updating packages.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are created in quick succession under the same process also suggests a normal development workflow rather than malicious activity. If there were unusual processes or accesses outside the expected scope, it might raise flags, but here everything aligns with typical git operations in a dev environment.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. There's a high likelihood that this is normal because all actions are consistent with standard development practices. Unless there's evidence of unusual timestamps, file paths pointing to sensitive areas, or deviations from expected patterns, I wouldn't flag this as interesting.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the batch shows multiple file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is expected during development. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe within a standard development environment's node_modules directory, indicating normal TypeScript declaration file generation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. All the events are JSON objects, each one indicating that a file was created by the process \"git.exe\". The files are all in different paths under the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. Each event corresponds to a .d.ts file, which I know is related to TypeScript definitions. \n\nFirst, I'm trying to think about what \"git.exe\" typically does. Git is version control software, and it's common for developers to use it. When working with Git, especially in environments where you're cloning repositories or performing operations that involve checking out code, Git might create or update files as part of its normal operation. So, creating these .d.ts files could be part of the process when setting up a project or updating dependencies.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all are under \"node_modules\", which suggests this is related to a Node.js project. The specific path includes \"cypress\" and \"lodash\", both of which are popular npm packages. Cypress is an automated testing tool for web applications, and Lodash is a utility library. So, these files might be part of the type definitions for these packages.\n\nI'm considering whether creating multiple .d.ts files in this way is normal or if it's something suspicious. Since Git can trigger file creation events when it syncs changes, especially during an initial clone where many files are being checked out, this could just be Git doing its thing. It doesn't seem to involve any unusual processes or accounts; all the activity is under the same user directory.\n\nAnother angle: Could these events indicate malicious activity? Well, I'm trying to think if attackers would use \"git.exe\" as a vector. While it's possible, typically, such attacks might involve more varied or less predictable file operations. Also, given that all files are in a standard location for Node.js modules and the types of files created (TypeScript definitions), this aligns with expected behavior during development setup.\n\nI'm also considering the frequency of these events. If there were only one or two, it might be more notable, but having multiple consecutive entries suggests a bulk operation, like cloning a repository or installing dependencies, which is entirely normal in a dev environment.\n\nAdditionally, I don't see any signs of tampering or execution in the logs provided. There's no indication that these files are being executed; they're just being created as part of the filesystem setup.\n\nSo putting it all together: The events seem to be part of standard Git operations related to setting up a development environment with Node.js and TypeScript.

The paths are all within a node_modules directory for cypress and lodash. That makes sense because git often interacts with file systems when managing repositories, especially in development environments where node_modules can be extensive.\n\nLooking at the file names, they're all .d.ts files, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files.

Let me take a closer look.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are coming from \"git.exe\". That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control and doesn't typically create files itself, especially not in this context. The task is labeled as \"File created\" with a rule name of \"FileCreate\", so these are standard file creation events.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different .d.ts files inside the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. Specifically, it's under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\". These files seem to be TypeScript definition files for Lodash utility functions.\n\nNow, considering the source process is Git and the location is within a project's node_modules, this seems like normal activity during development. When someone works with Node.js or npm packages, installing or updating dependencies (like Cypress) can trigger file creation events in node_modules. It's also possible that Git is being used to track changes in these files.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. There's no indication of unauthorized access, strange file names, or activities outside the scope of development tools. All the files created are standard TypeScript definitions, which are expected in a well-structured project using npm and Git.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit cautious because sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes for malicious actions. But in this case, the combination of process name, task type, and file paths all align with typical development operations. There's no evidence of file names that stand out as suspicious or any signs of file creation outside expected patterns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while it's always good to monitor such events, especially if they occur in unexpected volumes or at unusual times, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It looks like standard file creation during development setup or updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe within the node_modules directory, which is typical during development and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

The Windows log task is consistently labeled as \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate.\" This indicates that each event is related to the creation of a new file.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash. The filenames are various \".d.ts\" files, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These files typically define interfaces and types used by TypeScript projects.\n\nGiven that the process is Git and it's creating multiple files in a node_modules directory under a Cypress project, this looks like standard behavior during development. When using tools like npm or yarn, installing packages (like cypress) can trigger file creation events as part of the build or setup process. The fact that they're all \".d.ts\" files further supports this as TypeScript projects often generate these files automatically.\n\nI don't see any unusual processes or file accesses here. All activities are happening within a predictable development environment context. There's no evidence of unexpected file names, access outside common directories, or multiple failed attempts which might indicate malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch doesn't show signs of suspicious behavior.

It's common to see it performing file operations when developers are working on projects. The task being \"File created\" suggests that these are normal file creation events during the operation of Git or perhaps during some automated process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to TypeScript files within the node_modules directory, specifically under cypress and lodash types. This makes me think that these files are part of a JavaScript project using Cypress for testing and Lodash for utility functions. The \".d.ts\" extension indicates these are declaration files, which are used in TypeScript projects for type definitions.\n\nThe repetition of similar events with only the filename varying might be because Git is cloning or updating dependencies, especially since they're all under node_modules. This could be during an npm install or yarn install command when packages are being fetched and their types are being written to disk.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious behavior here. There's no indication that these file creations are part of malicious activity like known bad processes or access from unknown sources. The consistent process name and predictable file paths align with normal development activities, which are expected in a system where software is actively being developed or maintained.\n\nTherefore, while each event is normal on its own, seeing multiple similar events might raise an eyebrow if they come from different sources or involve unexpected files.

Node_modules is where npm packages are stored, and cypress is a common testing framework. The .d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files, which are standard in such projects for type definitions.\n\nSince all events are related to the same process and typical file operations during development or build processes, there's nothing unusual here.

Let's take a look.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name in all these events is \"git.exe\". The task under winlog says \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all within a user directory, specifically under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by various .d.ts files. These files include names like mean.d.ts, meanBy.d.ts, and so on.\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that all events are coming from the same process, git.exe, which is a legitimate software used for version control. The task is about file creation, which is a standard operation when working with files. The paths point to TypeScript declaration files in the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. Since these are part of a development environment setup, it's normal for git to interact with these files during installations or updates.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication that these files were modified or accessed by unauthorized processes. The repetition might be due to multiple file creations in the same directory as part of the build process or dependency management typical in development workflows.\n\nTherefore, considering all events together, they don't raise any red flags.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation. The logs are all related to file creation events by the git.exe process.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each one has the same structure: the process name is git.exe, the task is \"File created\" with a specific rule mentioned, and the file path points to various .d.ts files in the node_modules directory of a Cypress project under a user's Downloads folder.\n\nI know that JSONL stands for JSON Lines, which means each line is a separate JSON object. So here, each line represents a single event where a file was created by git.exe. The paths all lead into a specific module within a Cypress setup, which makes me think this is part of a development environment, maybe someone working on a project with node_modules and using tools like Cypress for testing.\n\nI'm trying to recall if creating multiple files in such a directory is normal. Since these are .d.ts files, they're TypeScript declaration files, typically generated during the build process. The fact that git.exe is involved might be because it's part of a GitHub or Git operation, perhaps cloning a repository or updating files.\n\nI'm considering whether this activity is suspicious. Malware or attacker activities often show patterns like repeated file creations in unexpected locations, especially system directories or personal files. However, here the files are all within a user's Downloads folder and under node_modules, which is standard for development projects. Cypress is a front-end testing tool, so its presence there aligns with typical dev setups.\n\nThe volume of events—14 in total—isn't particularly high, but it's also not low enough to raise immediate flags. If this were part of an automated process or legitimate build activity, such as during CI\/CD pipelines, it would make sense. Alternatively, if someone is manually adding files, it could be normal too.\n\nI should also consider the source of these logs. Are they from a corporate network where such activities are monitored closely? Or is this from a personal device where users have more control over their environment? In the latter case, development-related logs like these would likely not be considered suspicious unless there's specific context indicating unusual behavior.\n\nAnother angle is to check if git.exe is being used in an unusual way. Git can perform many operations, and creating files might be part of a clone or fetch process. Unless there are indicators that git.exe was used for malicious purposes, like executing arbitrary commands or accessing unauthorized resources, the file creation itself isn't concerning.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (if available) would help determine if these events happened in quick succession, which could indicate automation or script execution. Without that context, it's hard to say, but given the uniformity of the paths and filenames, they might be part of a batch process during development setup.\n\nI also think about false positives—maybe legitimate updates or installations of dependencies triggering these file creations. Node_modules is a common directory for npm packages, and Cypress being one suggests this is a JavaScript project environment.\n\nIn summary, while any log event should ideally be reviewed, the combination here doesn't raise red flags. The consistent use of git.exe creating files in a development-related directory seems more aligned with normal user activity than malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple .d.ts files under node_modules, which is typical during development setup and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}

The task in the winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to files within the \"node_modules\" directory of a Cypress project located at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\".

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each event is a JSON object with three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process field shows that the application is git.exe, which is commonly used for version control, especially in software development environments.\n\nThe winlog indicates that there's a \"File created\" task, meaning a new file was made on the system. The specific rule mentioned is FileCreate, so this is just an event of a file being created, nothing more unusual at first glance.\n\nLooking at the files themselves, all the paths start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\. Each path ends with different .d.ts files, such as remove.d.ts, repeat.d.ts, etc. These are TypeScript declaration files for Lodash functions. Lodash is a popular JavaScript library used for utility methods.\n\nThe fact that multiple .d.ts files are being created by git.exe suggests that this is part of the build process or during development when dependencies are being managed or installed. Node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js applications where third-party libraries, including Cypress and Lodash, are stored. The S206 course name points to \"Qualidade de Software,\" which translates to Software Quality, likely an academic course. So this seems like a user environment where software development is happening.\n\nSince all the events are similar and involve creating files in a typical Node.js module structure, there's no indication of any malicious activity here. There's no evidence of unexpected file creation locations or unusual file types that might suggest tampering or infection. The consistent naming pattern also supports the idea that this is part of normal development operations.\n\nI'm confident that these events are not suspicious because they align with standard activities in a software development context, particularly when using tools like Git and Node.js packages.

They all come from \"git.exe\" process, which is creating files under specific paths. The file paths are all within a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash types.

I notice that each event has a different filename but they all seem to be part of the same module.\n\nNow, considering what's normal. Cypress is a popular testing tool for JavaScript applications, and node_modules are where dependencies are stored. It's common during development or setup processes for such tools to create or update files in these directories. The fact that git.exe is involved might indicate it's part of a version control process, possibly during a checkout or sync operation.\n\nAre there any red flags? Each event is just creating a file, which isn't inherently suspicious. There's no indication of access to sensitive files, unusual processes, or multiple failed attempts which could suggest an attack. All the paths are within expected locations for development tools and modules.\n\nI also consider the volume. While there are several events here (15 in this example), it's not an unusually high number for such operations during a build or setup phase. Each file creation is isolated to the same process and location, without any signs of lateral movement or attempts to access other parts of the system.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple instances of files being created by git.exe in a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash.
