{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe creating a file named objeto_temporario.txt in the user's Downloads folder. That's suspicious because PowerShell is often used maliciously, especially when creating files without obvious reason.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome can modify the registry for settings, doing this so many times in a row might be unusual. I should check if this activity is part of normal updates or something else.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is executed with a command line that seems normal—just checking user information. But since it's followed by more PowerShell activities, maybe there's an elevation happening here or persistence being set up.\n\nLooking further, another powershell.exe instance runs with a suspicious script path: Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which sounds like it's meant to capture keystrokes—a classic sign of malware trying to gather credentials.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various .NET DLLs. This is expected if running scripts, but combined with the other activities, it adds up.\n\nLastly, two more provider lifecycle events for powershell.exe executing similar scripts pointing to different paths, both aiming to log keystrokes in the TEMP directory.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts, file creation, and registry modifications suggest possible malicious activity. The repeated actions might be part of establishing persistence or lateral movement within a network. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts with potentially malicious intent, including file creation and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the process field: several entries show powershell.exe with command lines executing scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds suspicious because it suggests keylogging activity, which is often malicious. The fact that multiple commands are running this script across different paths indicates possible persistence or multiple attempts to log keystrokes.\n\nNext, the winlog field shows tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle for powershell.exe. These aren't unusual in themselves, but combined with the command line activities, they raise a red flag. Additionally, there's an event where 'Execute a Remote Command' is logged, which could imply that the script is being run remotely, adding to potential malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at file operations: I see File created and deleted events for temporary .ps1 files in the AppData directory. This suggests that the script might be trying to avoid detection by creating and then deleting files quickly. Also, there's a FileDeleteDetected event, which could mean the system flagged something as suspicious when the file was deleted.\n\nAnother point is the Registry value set tasks for both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence between reboots. The combination of registry writes and keylogging scripts makes this more concerning.\n\nI also notice that some events have None for the file field, but others reference specific paths where files are being created or deleted. The variety of paths in the command lines (like C:\\objeto_secundario\\...) might be an attempt to spread out malicious activities across different directories, making it harder to detect them all at once.\n\nThe fact that multiple events involve powershell.exe with these scripts suggests a possible campaign or repeated attempts by an attacker. Powershell is commonly used in cyberattacks for its legitimate use but can also execute malicious scripts quietly.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which might be unrelated unless it's part of the attack vector, but I don't see enough context there to consider it suspicious on its own.\n\nOverall, the batch shows several red flags: repeated execution of keylogging scripts, temporary file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and remote command execution. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior, so the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe running keylogging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's look at each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization State directory. Svchost.exe is a common system process, often used by services, so it's normal for it to create files there. No immediate red flags here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool used for log management. Its process creating its own config file seems legitimate, especially during setup or updates. This doesn't raise any suspicions.\n\nThe third event involves powershell.exe creating a file named entrada_padrao.txt. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, but it's also common for admins to use it. The filename doesn't seem malicious at first glance, and without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nLooking at the batch as a whole, all events are about file creations by legitimate processes. There's no unusual combination or repeated activity that would indicate malicious behavior. Each event appears isolated and within normal operational procedures.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes creating files, which is expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
