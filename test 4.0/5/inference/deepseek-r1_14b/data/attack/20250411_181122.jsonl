{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event to understand what's happening. Starting with the first event: it's about 'whoami.exe' being run from the system32 directory. That seems normal because whoami is a standard utility used to display user information. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to powershell.exe. Let me see what each of these does. The second event shows powershell.exe being accessed, which itself isn't suspicious unless it's part of malicious activity. But looking further, I notice several Registry value sets by powershell.exe processes. Modifying the registry can be legitimate for configuration changes, but it's a common tactic for malware too.\n\nThen, there's an event where powershell.exe is run with a specific command line. The command includes 'findstr' searching for \"pass\" in various file types and then using select-string to find the pattern \"password\". That immediately raises my attention because this looks like a script intended to search for sensitive information, such as passwords, across different files. This kind of activity is often associated with data theft or espionage.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line. This repetition suggests that the process might be running in a loop or part of a larger script execution. The fact that the same command is repeated could indicate an attempt to avoid detection by spreading out the activity or testing different aspects of the system.\n\nAnother point to note is the file creation and subsequent deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1'. This temporary PowerShell script might be part of a process that's trying to check if certain policies are in place or to test execution. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to leave no trace, which is a common tactic for malicious activities.\n\nThe events also show multiple image loads by powershell.exe into various DLLs, including mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, their loading in the context of other suspicious activities might warrant closer inspection.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it's clear that there's a combination of normal and potentially malicious activities here. The use of PowerShell with specific commands targeting sensitive data, coupled with repeated process creation and scripting behavior, makes this batch of events stand out as concerning. It's possible that an attacker is using legitimate tools in a way that's intended to gather sensitive information or establish persistence.\n\nTherefore, the entire batch should be classified as interesting for investigation because the activities, when viewed collectively, indicate potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show suspicious activity including searching for 'password' in various files and repeated process creations. These behaviors may indicate data theft or malicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see if anything stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nFirst event: A PowerShell process with a command line that includes searching for 'pass' in various file types. That seems suspicious because it looks like it's trying to find sensitive information, which could be part of an attack.\n\nSecond event: Notepad.exe setting a registry value. Not sure if that's normal, but Notepad isn't typically used for such tasks, so I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThird event: Another PowerShell process accessing something. Since the first one was suspicious, this might be part of the same activity or related.\n\nFourth event: Calc.exe loading a system DLL. That seems okay; maybe just normal operation since Calculator is known to load URLMON.DLL for certain functionalities.\n\nFifth event: Powershell again accessing another file. Could be benign, but considering previous events, it's something to watch.\n\nSixth event: Findstr.exe being used with specific search patterns. This reinforces the idea that there's a script searching through files for passwords or sensitive data.\n\nSeventh and eighth events: Svchost.exe modifying registry values. Svchost is often associated with legitimate services but can also be malicious. The repeated registry changes might indicate persistence mechanisms.\n\nNinth event: Conhost, ApplicationFrameHost, Calculator all setting registry values. These are typically benign processes, but multiple registry writes could be a sign of something more.\n\nTenth event: Chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying the registry. Not sure if that's unusual for Chrome, but it's worth noting as sometimes malware can abuse legitimate processes.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several signs that point towards potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines, multiple instances of registry modifications by different processes, and the search for sensitive data using findstr.exe all add up. These behaviors could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence or exfiltrate data.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because while some events might seem benign on their own, the combination suggests possible malicious intent. The confidence isn't too high (maybe around 0.6) because I can't definitively confirm without more context, but there are enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell executing suspicious command lines, including searching for sensitive data, and repeated registry modifications by various processes indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are quite a few entries here, all related to different processes and Windows logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve 'chrome.exe'. Specifically, there are multiple instances where Chrome is setting registry values, which could be normal if it's updating settings or extensions. But since there are so many such events (around 15), it might indicate something suspicious, like potential tampering with system configurations.\n\nThen, there are DNS queries from Chrome as well. While Chrome does perform DNS lookups for web browsing, multiple consecutive queries without clear justification could be a red flag, possibly related to domain generation or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the 'winlogbeat.exe' entry, it's creating a file in its data directory. That seems legitimate as part of its operation, so probably not an issue there.\n\nTwo entries show PowerShell creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used for executing scripts or commands. Creating files without clear context might be indicative of malicious activity, like storing data for further actions.\n\nThe Network connection events from Chrome are also worth noting. While browsers do connect to servers, multiple connections without corresponding web traffic could suggest data exfiltration or communication with external servers, which raises suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the high number of registry changes, repeated DNS queries, and file creation by PowerShell—it's likely that there's malicious activity occurring here. The combination suggests possible persistence mechanisms (registry), domain generation for command and control, and file operations that could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications by chrome.exe, DNS queries, network connections, and file creation by powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few events from winlogbeat.exe creating files. That seems normal because it's likely the log shipping tool doing its job. Then, powershell.exe creates a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both good and bad purposes, so I should keep an eye on that.\n\nThere's an event where process is None, which might just be noise or an error in logging. Moving on, another winlogbeat event creating the same .winlogbeat.yml.new file again—so nothing unusual there.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accesses a process, and whoami.exe runs with its command line. Whoami is usually harmless, but sometimes attackers use it to check permissions or user info. Powershell accessing processes could be for legitimate admin tasks or malicious activities.\n\nAnother set of events from cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks. Deleting tasks can be part of system cleanup, but if these tasks were created by something suspicious earlier, it might indicate an attempt to remove traces. The command lines in the process show specific task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". These names don't immediately ring alarm bells, but they could be part of a script trying to clean up after itself.\n\nThere are events where svchost.exe interacts with the registry. Svchost is a common process for services, so registry changes aren't unusual unless they're modifying something sensitive or known bad keys. The taskschd.dll loaded by schtasks is normal since it's part of the task scheduler.\n\nMore cmd.exe and conhost.exe events manipulating the registry—conhost is often related to console windows, so I'm not sure why it's setting a registry value. This might be worth investigating further.\n\nPowershell continues accessing processes and modifying the registry multiple times. The repetition could indicate that these are part of a script or automated process, which might be suspicious if there's no clear justification for all these actions.\n\nIn summary, while some events look normal (like winlogbeat and svchost), others like powershell.exe creating files, deleting scheduled tasks with specific names, and multiple registry modifications could indicate malicious activity. The combination of these events, especially the use of cmd.exe to delete tasks and the repeated powershell activities, raises concern about potential system compromise or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities such as file creation by PowerShell, process access attempts, registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks. These actions could be indicative of malicious behavior or an attempt to maintain persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm new to analyzing logs, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data, each line represents an event with 'process', 'winlog', and sometimes 'file' information. The goal is to determine if all these events together indicate something malicious or suspicious.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. **cmd.exe** was executed with a command-line argument that tries to delete notepad.exe using wmic. That seems odd because why would someone want to delete Notepad? Maybe trying to remove traces of something else.\n2. **powershell.exe** is accessed, which is often used for scripting and can be malicious if used in certain ways. But alone, it's not suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n3. Another cmd.exe event shows registry value being set. Registry modifications are common but could indicate changes made by malware.\n4. **WMIC.exe** is run with a command to delete processes named notepad.exe. WMIC can be used for remote commands and is often targeted in attacks because it has admin privileges. Deleting Notepad might suggest trying to remove evidence or disable tools.\n5. WMIC loads several DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, etc. These are standard Windows components, so that's not alarming yet.\n6. Powershell accesses again and sets registry values. The combination of powershell and registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n7. Notepad.exe itself is set to run with certain privileges or has its properties changed—another point for possible tampering.\n8. cmd.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe are involved in creating processes or accessing registry. Whoami usually just shows user info, but being called from these scripts might be part of some larger scheme.\n\nI notice multiple instances where powershell and cmd are used to delete users or modify system settings (like net.exe and net1.exe commands). Deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" suggests someone is trying to remove administrative accounts. This could mean an attacker is cleaning up after themselves or removing other user accounts to escalate privileges.\n\nThe repeated use of WMIC, cmd, and powershell with delete commands on user accounts is concerning. These activities don't look like normal system operations; they might be part of a larger attack where the perpetrator is trying to erase traces or take control over the system.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple processes attempting to delete system files, modify registry entries, and remove user accounts using tools often associated with malicious activities. This pattern suggests possible unauthorized access or destructive behavior, making the batch definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple attempts to delete system processes and administrative users using cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe. These actions are indicative of potential malicious activities such as privilege escalation or system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. I'll go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where `powershell.exe` is being accessed with tasks like 'ProcessAccess' and 'RegistryEvent'. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so frequent access might be suspicious, especially if combined with other activities.\n\nLooking further, I notice several instances of user account management. Commands like deleting users using `net.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe` are present. Specifically, commands like `\/del \/domain` suggest attempts to delete user accounts across the domain. This could indicate an attempt to remove traces or elevate privileges.\n\nThere's also a lot of registry activity from various processes, including `services.exe` and `conhost.exe`. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it remains active after reboots.\n\nAnother point is the use of `whoami.exe`, which could help determine user context or system information. Coupled with other activities, this might be a way for an attacker to gather info about the system.\n\nThe deletion commands like 'sc delete win32times' target specific services, possibly trying to disable monitoring tools or create gaps in logs.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple attempts to modify user accounts, frequent registry changes, and deletions of services could indicate someone trying to remove traces, elevate privileges, or cover their tracks. These activities collectively raise red flags about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user account deletion attempts using various commands across different processes, combined with extensive registry modifications and service deletions, suggest potential unauthorized system access or tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of events from different processes. \n\nFirst off, there's 'whoami.exe' running a couple of times. That seems normal because it's often used by legitimate scripts to get user info. But then I see multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and even creating new processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legit admin tasks and malicious activities, so that raises an eyebrow.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values. That's a bit concerning because attackers often use the registry to persistence their malware or modify system configurations. Also, I notice some cmd.exe processes deleting files in the Temp directory. The filenames like \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\" seem suspicious—they might be leftovers from malicious scripts trying to clean up after themselves.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks related to powershell.exe. These events can indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not typical, possibly for executing commands or running scripts. Also, the image load events showing DLLs loaded by powershell.exe could be part of malicious activities, especially if those DLLs aren't legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell and cmd processes accessing system files, registry edits, and file deletions in Temp suggests possible malicious behavior. While some actions might be benign, the volume and types of these events make the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system resources, registry modifications, and file deletions in the Temp directory, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. The user is asking me to analyze all the events together and decide based on their combination.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common for legitimate scripts but can also be malicious since many attackers use it. There are multiple instances where PowerShell loads images (ImageLoad) and accesses files and registry entries. The creation and deletion of temp files like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1' stands out because temporary script files could be a sign of testing or trying to bypass certain policies.\n\nAlso, the events show multiple attempts to create processes, especially whoami.exe being called several times. Whoami is often used to check user privileges and might indicate reconnaissance activities. The fact that it's executed from PowerShell adds more suspicion.\n\nThere are a couple of other processes like winlogbeat.exe creating files, but those seem benign as they're likely log management tools. However, the repeated and varied actions from PowerShell suggest possible malicious behavior, such as script testing or lateral movement.\n\nConsidering all these together, even though some events alone might not be alarming, the combination points towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe loading and accessing files, creating temporary files, deleting them, and accessing registry entries. Additionally, repeated creation of whoami.exe processes. These activities could indicate suspicious or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, each representing different activities on a system. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe` being executed. This is a legitimate system tool used to display user information, so that seems normal unless it's part of an attack.\n- Powershell.exe is accessed several times. Powershell can be malicious if used for scripting attacks but on its own, accessing it isn't suspicious unless there's evidence of malicious scripts running.\n\nNext, I see events involving `RuntimeBroker.exe` and `notepad.exe`. These are standard Windows processes; RuntimeBroker handles user runtime operations, and Notepad is a simple text editor. Their presence alone doesn't raise flags.\n\nThen, there's an entry for `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`. URLMON.DLL is part of the Windows shell used for handling URLs, so this isn't unusual. Calculator executing scripts might be a red flag, but in this case, it's just loading a standard DLL.\n\nLooking at events with `svchost.exe`, I know that SVCHOST is a generic host process for services and can sometimes be associated with malware. However, seeing multiple instances accessing the registry isn't inherently suspicious unless they're part of malicious activity like installing backdoors or altering system configurations.\n\nThere's an event from `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely logging tool software; it writing to its log files is expected behavior and not concerning.\n\nI notice multiple DNS queries and network connections from `chrome.exe`. Browsers naturally make these connections as part of normal browsing activity, especially when accessing different websites or downloading content.\n\nOther events include processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe (used for app containers), Calculator.exe (standard application), and Chrome.exe (browser). These are all typical applications performing their usual tasks.\n\nConsidering the entire batch, there's a lot of legitimate system activity. No single event stands out as overtly malicious. The repeated use of Powershell and registry accesses by svchost.exe could be points to check if there's more context, but without additional data like process arguments or file hashes, it's hard to classify them as malicious.\n\nI don't see any signs of exploits, data exfiltration attempts, or unusual file creations. All the activities listed are within the realm of normal user behavior and system processes. Therefore, this batch doesn't indicate anything suspicious that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as whoami.exe, powershell.exe, notepad.exe, chrome.exe, and others performing standard operations. There is no indication of malicious activity or unusual behavior in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
