{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. The user wants me to analyze all the events together as a whole, considering their combination.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where PowerShell is accessed. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and script execution because it's powerful and can do a lot of things on a system. The fact that it's being accessed several times could be suspicious, especially if the events aren't part of normal user activity.\n\nThen I see cmd.exe and sc.exe being used in commands that involve creating services with unusual names like 'win32times' or 'componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Using sc.exe to create services is a common technique for persistence; attackers might set up a service that runs malicious code at startup. The command lines have arguments that start powershell scripts, which raises my concern because it's an indirect way of executing code.\n\nLooking further, there are several Registry value sets across different processes like services.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, etc. This activity could indicate an attacker modifying system configurations or creating persistence mechanisms by changing registry entries. Registry modifications can be part of setting up backdoors or ensuring malicious scripts run at startup.\n\nNotable is the use of 'binPath' in sc create commands pointing to .ps1 files that don't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). This suggests an attempt to execute PowerShell scripts from non-existent locations, which might be a way to avoid detection or as part of a failed execution. It's also possible that these are remnants of an attack where the actual script was deleted after use.\n\nThe events involving RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll could indicateDLL injection techniques or attempts to load malicious libraries into legitimate processes. This is a common tactic for attackers to hide their activities by blending in with normal process behavior.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe accesses the registry, which might be part of creating a hidden command prompt window or other malicious activity that requires elevated privileges or specific system interactions.\n\nWhile there are some normal events like whoami.exe being run and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll (which is standard for Windows processes), the overall pattern seems to lean towards malicious activities. The repeated use of PowerShell, creation of services with suspicious names, multiple registry modifications across different processes, and attempts to execute scripts from non-existent paths create a concerning picture.\n\nPutting it all together, these events seem indicative of potential unauthorized access or malicious activity on the system. The combination suggests an attack vector where attackers are trying to establish persistence, elevate privileges, or carry out some form of payload execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell accesses, creation of services with non-existent scripts, and registry modifications. Indicators suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's normal since it's likely the log agent itself writing data.\n\nThen there are multiple processes: ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and several instances of powershell.exe, all setting registry values. Powershell is commonly used for scripting but could be malicious, though just setting reg values isn't conclusive.\n\nNotably, there's a powershell.exe accessing another process (ProcessAccess). That might indicate some interaction between processes, which could be suspicious if it's unexpected.\n\nChrome.exe appears multiple times setting registry values and loading several DLLs. The fact that Chrome is involved and doing many Registry writes might raise an eyebrow because browsers don't typically do that unless there's some extension or malicious activity.\n\nThe repetition of the same tasks by chrome.exe, like multiple Registry writes and loading specific system files, could indicate tampering or malware attempting persistence or injection into the browser process.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell is often a red flag in logs, especially when combined with other activities. The repeated actions from Chrome might suggest something's amiss there too. While individually some events look normal, the combination and frequency could point to malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe setting registry values and accessing processes, along with repeated registry activity from chrome.exe, may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
