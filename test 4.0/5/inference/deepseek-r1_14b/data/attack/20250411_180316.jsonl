{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event from system logs. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're something worth investigating. The output needs to be a single classification: either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nLooking at the events, I notice that several of them involve processes like 'powershell.exe', 'cmd.exe', and 'WMIC.exe'. These are tools often used for legitimate purposes but can also be abused by attackers. For instance, PowerShell is commonly used in scripts and can execute commands, which might be a red flag if they're doing something malicious.\n\nI see an event where cmd.exe was run with the command line: '\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete'. That seems suspicious because it's using WMIC to delete processes. Why would someone want to delete notepad.exe? Maybe trying to remove evidence or stop a process they don't want running.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple instances of Registry values being set by various processes, including svchost.exe and others. Changing registry entries can be part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms. If an attacker modifies the registry to ensure their malware runs on startup, that's something we'd want to look into.\n\nThere are also events where 'whoami.exe' was executed. This command is often used to determine user privileges or permissions. If this is run in the context of a compromised account, it could be part of an attack chain to gather information about the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events loading DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. These might not be suspicious on their own, but repeated accesses or unusual load paths could indicate malicious activity, especially if combined with other events.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs that could indicate malicious behavior: deletion of processes, registry modifications, user information gathering, and potential DLL injection. While individual events might seem benign, the combination raises red flags. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including process deletions, registry modifications, and use of tools like PowerShell and WMIC which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, there's a process named \"WMIC.exe\" loading a file called MpOAV.dll. WMIC is known for being used in some malware because it can execute commands remotely. But the file path looks legitimate—it’s part of Windows Defender. Maybe that's just normal behavior, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries where different processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe are setting registry values. Registry writes can be common, especially for applications setting configurations. But when multiple processes do this, it might indicate something malicious trying to modify system settings or create persistence.\n\nLooking further, there are a couple of powershell.exe entries accessing processes and setting registry values. PowerShell is powerful but often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe process copying an exe file to system32, which might be replacing legitimate system tools. That sounds risky because replacing such files can allow persistence or elevate privileges. Another cmd.exe command is deleting a scheduled task, which in some cases can hide malicious activity by removing traces of prior actions.\n\nAdditionally, schtasks.exe is used to delete a task. This could be part of an attack trying to remove monitoring tools or disable security features.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using WMIC, multiple registry writes, powershell and cmd executions, and modifying system files suggests potential malicious activity. These activities are often indicators of compromise, like privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, and lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes including WMIC.exe, PowerShell, and cmd.exe performing potentially malicious actions such as registry modifications, file copying to system32, and deleting scheduled tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each event is a JSON object with details about the process, Windows log task, and file involved.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where common executables like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe are involved in tasks such as Process Create or accessing registry values. These activities by themselves might not be suspicious because these tools can be used legitimately for system administration or scripting.\n\nHowever, the frequency of these events stands out. There are multiple entries with similar processes and tasks, which could indicate repeated attempts to execute commands or modify system configurations. This repetition might suggest an automated process or script running multiple times, possibly trying different things each time.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe and schtasks.exe. Conhost.exe is often used in command-line environments, but seeing it alongside other tools raises questions about its context here. Schtasks.exe is related to scheduled tasks; having this process logged with image loading could be part of legitimate task management, but it's worth noting as malicious actors might misuse scheduled tasks for persistence.\n\nI also see Registry events where values are being set or objects added\/deleted. These activities can be part of software installation or configuration changes, but frequent registry modifications without a clear purpose could be a red flag, especially if combined with other behaviors.\n\nLooking at the command lines, cmd.exe is often used with \"\/c\" which runs a command and then exits. This might be part of executing scripts or commands from other processes. Powershell.exe entries are common too, which is concerning because it's a powerful tool that can execute code and handle system tasks, making it a favorite for attackers.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of multiple legitimate tools being used with repetitive registry modifications could indicate suspicious activity. This might be part of an attack chain where an adversary is setting up persistence mechanisms or trying to deploy malicious scripts across different sessions.\n\nWhile each individual event isn't necessarily alarming on its own, the aggregate behavior suggests potential malicious intent. The repeated use of these tools and the nature of the tasks they're performing could be indicators of an active threat. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of legitimate executables (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) being used with potentially malicious intent patterns such as repeated registry modifications and process creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user gave me a bunch of JSONL entries and wants me to analyze them as a whole.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see processes like whoami.exe and powershell.exe being created and accessed multiple times. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously, so that's something to note. There are registry value sets which could indicate configuration changes—maybe persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are file creations and deletions in the Temp directory under a specific user's AppData. The file paths like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 suggest script execution, possibly testing something against policies. That's a bit concerning because it might be related to policy bypass attempts.\n\nAlso, there are ImageLoad events loading various .NET and Windows Defender files. While that's normal for PowerShell scripts, in some cases, these could be part of malicious activities trying to hide or load malicious code.\n\nThe events show repeated process creations with command lines like 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems unusual. This might indicate a script being executed in a way that's not typical, possibly obfuscating the actual command.\n\nI'm noticing that after creating some files, they get deleted immediately, which is common in malware to avoid detection by cleaning up evidence quickly. Also, the use of multiple registry writes and process accesses could be setting up persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThere are also entries from winlogbeat.exe writing a configuration file, which might be part of log management but could also be something else if not properly secured.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell executions with possible script actions, file operations in Temp, registry changes, and process creations. These patterns often correlate with malicious activities like persistence, lateral movement, or dropping payloads. The combination suggests potential compromise attempts rather than normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution, registry modifications, and file operations in the Temp directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The tasks mentioned include ImageLoad, FileCreate, RegistryEvent, ProcessAccess, and Provider Lifecycle. These are common operations for scripts or legitimate processes, but their frequency might raise flags.\n\nLooking closer, several events have command lines that execute PowerShell with if statements checking the existence of .bat files. For example:\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe & {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}'\"}\n```\nThese commands are checking for specific batch files and exiting based on their presence. This behavior is unusual because it's testing the existence of files that might be part of malicious scripts or payloads.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where 'powershell.exe' interacts with the registry (Registry value set) and accesses other processes. These actions can be signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'powershell.exe' with varying command lines. While PowerShell is commonly used, such a high volume of calls, especially with conditional checks on file existence, suggests potentially malicious activity. It's possible that these are parts of a script trying to execute different stages or modules based on certain conditions.\n\nMoreover, some events load DLLs like 'MpClient.dll' and 'mscoree.dll', which could be legitimate but might also indicate the use of reflective DLL injection or other evasion techniques if they're loaded in an unexpected context.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple PowerShell instances with conditional file checks, registry interactions, and image loading—it's reasonable to conclude that this batch of events indicates suspicious activity. The combination suggests possible script execution, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network, which are key indicators of potential cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with conditional file checks and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I see that the logs are in JSONL format, each line is a JSON object. So there are multiple events here. Let me go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all mention 'powershell.exe' as the process name. The tasks involve things like Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) and File created or deleted. The files being accessed include paths like C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET... which seem to be standard .NET framework files. Then there's a file creation in the Temp folder, specifically 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1'. That looks like a PowerShell script test file.\n\nThen I see that the same script is being deleted. So it's creating and then deleting a temporary script. Maybe this is part of some automated process or testing?\n\nAfter that, there are entries from 'chrome.exe' modifying the registry multiple times. This seems normal since Chrome often makes registry changes during updates or configuration changes.\n\nThen back to PowerShell: there's a Pipe Created event, which might indicate communication between processes. Also, there are command lines with paths like C:\\modulo_ativo and checking for .bat files. It looks like they're using if statements in PowerShell to test if certain files exist. If the file doesn't exist, they exit with 0; else, maybe proceed.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some of these command lines look suspicious because they involve multiple levels of directory traversal (using '..') which could be an attempt to access parent directories or move files around. Also, paths like 'modulo_ativo' and 'elemento_padrao.txt' don't ring any bells as standard system files.\n\nThere's also a file creation in the StartupProfileData folder under PowerShell, which is normal for user profile initialization but combined with other activities might be concerning.\n\nThe use of multiple registry writes by Chrome could be normal, but if there were more entries or unusual values, it might raise flags. However, in this case, they seem consistent with browser updates or settings changes.\n\nPutting it all together: PowerShell creating and deleting temporary scripts, accessing system files, checking for specific files with a pattern that's not clearly malicious, and Chrome making registry changes. The combination of file operations, script testing, and potential directory traversal might indicate some automated or potentially malicious activity. But without more context on whether these actions are expected behavior, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because there's a lot happening with PowerShell, which is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The creation of temporary scripts and the directory traversal in command lines could be indicators of something more serious. However, some of these actions might just be part of normal system operations or user script execution.\n\nSo my confidence is around 0.6 because there are red flags but not enough concrete evidence to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events including file creation, deletion, and registry modifications along with suspicious directory traversal patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}

I'm looking at a batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The command lines in these events are creating new items in various directories and setting content with \"dir\". Creating batch files using New-Item and Set-Content might be part of setting up persistence or performing directory traversal, which could indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged: there's a mix of Process Create, Process Access, Registry changes, and Image Load events. The fact that powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various .NET frameworks might be normal for script execution, but combined with the file creation activities, it raises suspicion.\n\nAnother point is that several events are marked as 'Provider Lifecycle', which isn't a standard event type I'm familiar with in Windows logs. This could mean they're custom or related to specific services being started or stopped, which again might be part of malicious behavior trying to establish persistence.\n\nThe files mentioned don't seem immediately suspicious on their own, but the pattern of creating multiple batch files across different directories is concerning. Attackers often use such scripts to spread across systems or execute commands at a later time.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances creating and writing to various files, along with registry access, could indicate script execution that's worth investigating for potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are creating new batch files and setting content in various directories.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and executing malicious commands. The events show things like file creations, deletions, registry changes, and image loads from PowerShell, which can be signs of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged: there are FileCreate, FileDeleteDetected, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, and ProcessCreate. These activities could indicate that something is being written to or read from the system, possibly setting up persistence mechanisms or creating backdoors.\n\nOne event stands out where PowerShell is executing a command-line script that creates batch files in specific directories. The use of \"New-Item\" and \"Set-Content\" commands suggests file creation, which might be part of installing malicious scripts on the system. Also, deleting temporary files afterward could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent tasks make me think the attacker is trying to modify system configurations or create registry keys for persistence. Additionally, multiple ImageLoad events loading DLLs are typical in PowerShell to execute code without being easily detected by simple checks.\n\nThere's also a ProcessCreate event where a script tests if a specific batch file exists and exits based on that. This could be part of a mechanism to check if the system is already compromised or to avoid execution if certain conditions aren't met.\n\nConsidering all these together, the combination of PowerShell activity with file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and multiple process creations points towards potential malicious behavior. The consistency in using PowerShell for various tasks without clear legitimate use (like user-initiated script execution) increases my suspicion.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that this batch is interesting as it shows signs of possible unauthorized system changes and could indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including file creation, deletion, registry modifications, and process creations suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several events where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths in these commands look a bit odd, like \"C:\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\elemento_padrao\\\\..\\\\registro_logico\\\\estrutura_principal_script.bat\". I'm noticing that each command checks if a specific batch file exists and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. This seems repetitive but possibly part of some script checking mechanism.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe loads MpOAV.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. That's normal because Defender uses these components for scanning. Next, I see that a temp PowerShell script file is created and then deleted shortly after. Creating and deleting temporary scripts can be part of legitimate processes, but it might also be indicative of malicious activity trying to cover its tracks.\n\nAnother event shows a pipe being created in powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, so this could be normal or it could be something more nefarious depending on context.\n\nThere's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup for log management, so that seems legitimate unless there's something off about its behavior here.\n\nA few events later, powershell.exe accesses the registry and interacts with files related to the PowerShell profile. These actions are common during script execution but could also be signs of configuration changes by malware.\n\nLooking at all these together, I'm noticing a pattern: multiple attempts to check for batch files, creation and deletion of temp scripts, DLL loading, and Registry interactions. The repetitive checks for specific .bat files might suggest some automated process or possibly an attempt to ensure certain files are present before executing malicious code. The creation and quick deletion of the script file could indicate that it's testing whether it can create temporary files without being detected.\n\nWhile each event on its own isn't necessarily suspicious, the combination raises a red flag. The repetitive command line patterns checking for batch files across different directories might be probing the system to find specific targets or attempting to execute code conditionally based on file presence. Additionally, the deletion of the script after creation is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection by security tools.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the sequence and combination of events suggest possible malicious activity or at least unusual behavior that merits further investigation. The confidence level isn't super high (maybe around 0.6) because some of these actions could still be part of legitimate script executions, but the overall pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe checking for specific batch files, creating and deleting a temporary script file, loading Defender components, and accessing registry.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event shows \"whoami.exe\" being executed. That's usually a legitimate command used to display user information. It doesn't seem malicious on its own, but I'll keep it in mind as part of the bigger picture.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate administration tasks and for malicious activities. Looking at the command lines, they all have if statements checking if specific files exist and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that. This pattern repeats several times across different paths. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\pacote_principal\\\\objeto_base...\" look suspicious because they don't seem to follow standard Windows directory structures. These could be signs of an attempt to check for the presence of certain files, possibly dropped by malware.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and loads images. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, the combination with the file checks might indicate something more. Malware often uses such techniques to verify its components or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe later events show specific registry activity (Registry value set) and process creations with command lines that include escaped quotes, which could be an attempt to hide certain parts of the command or to construct a more complex payload.\n\nPutting it all together, these events suggest someone is running PowerShell scripts that check for specific files across various directories. This behavior isn't typical of regular user activity and could indicate a malicious actor trying to establish persistence, spread within the network, or verify the presence of certain tools. The repeated attempts and the non-standard paths add to the suspicion.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation because it shows potentially malicious activity using PowerShell, which is commonly exploited by attackers.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances checking for specific files across various directories, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's already something to pay attention to because PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities like executing commands and lateral movement in an attack.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there's an Image loaded event for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. These seem like normal files, but I should check if they're being accessed in a suspicious way. Then, there are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events on temporary PowerShell script files. The file paths look unusual with the names starting with \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\". This might be part of some policy testing or perhaps an attempt to create and delete scripts quickly, which could indicate something is trying to hide its tracks.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where the task is 'Engine Lifecycle' for PowerShell. That sounds like it's related to how the PowerShell engine is starting up or shutting down. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen I see several Registry value sets and Process accesses in PowerShell. These could indicate that the script is attempting to interact with system settings or other processes, which is often part of malicious activity to establish persistence or gather information.\n\nThere are also two instances where whoami.exe is executed. This is commonly used to check user privileges or identity, so it's a bit concerning when combined with other suspicious activities. Additionally, cmd.exe is run with a command that checks if a file exists in the temp directory and exits based on that. The use of cmd with such a conditional might be part of some automated process, but it could also be an attempt to delete traces or execute further commands conditionally.\n\nI'm noticing a pattern here: multiple PowerShell processes with varied activities, including script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, process access, and the use of other utilities like whoami.exe and cmd.exe. This combination raises red flags because attackers often string together these actions as part of their attack chain—like using one tool to drop another or gather information.\n\nThe fact that some events are from Windows Defender components (MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll) being loaded by PowerShell is interesting too. If an attacker is trying to masquerade their activities under the guise of legitimate system processes, this could be a tactic to avoid detection. Alternatively, it might just be normal behavior, but given the other suspicious events, it adds to the concern.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but if these events occurred within a short timeframe, that would further suggest a coordinated attack rather than normal user activity spread out over time.\n\nAnother point is the repeated ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks in PowerShell. This could indicate that the script is attempting to interact with other processes or modify system settings repeatedly, which isn't typical for standard administrative tasks but is common in attacks to gain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\nThe use of multiple command-line arguments in cmd.exe also stands out. The conditional check (IF EXIST ...) might be part of a script trying to execute different payloads based on the presence of certain files, which is a technique used by malware to avoid detection or to adapt its behavior based on the environment.\n\nIn summary, while some events individually might not look suspicious, the combination—especially the repeated use of PowerShell with various file operations, registry changes, and process interactions along with other utilities like cmd.exe and whoami.exe—points toward potential malicious activity. The pattern suggests a possible attack chain where an attacker is using these tools to execute commands, check permissions, modify system settings, and potentially hide their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell.exe, including file creation\/deletion in temporary locations, registry modifications, process access, and use of utilities like whoami.exe and cmd.exe.

Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated use might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some events, I notice that they're using powershell.exe with specific if statements checking the existence of certain .cs files. This looks like scripting to test file presence. If these files exist, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. The paths referenced seem to be spread across different directories, which might indicate a scan or attempt to verify multiple locations.\n\nThe events also show several ImageLoad tasks for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal when running scripts but could be part of more complex activities.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some event on the system. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers, so its usage could be either benign or malicious. Let me look into what each event shows.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are tasks like Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, etc. The file paths mentioned seem to point to legitimate system files and temporary folders. For example, one of them is `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform...` which looks like a Windows Defender file. Another one is under `AppData\\Local\\Temp`, which is a common temp directory.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell checks if certain files exist using `Test-Path`. The command lines have conditions that exit with 0 or 1 based on whether specific files are present. This seems like some kind of script checking for the existence of other files, possibly to determine if it's running in a controlled environment or to ensure necessary files are there before proceeding.\n\nI also see registry value sets and process accesses. These could be part of legitimate operations, but they can also be signs of malicious activity trying to modify system configurations or gather information.\n\nThe fact that multiple events involve checking for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` suggests that the script might be attempting to log keystrokes or perform keylogging, which is a common tactic in malware. However, without seeing the content of these scripts, it's hard to confirm their purpose.\n\nAnother point is the repeated pattern of creating temporary files and then deleting them. This behavior can help evade detection since malicious activities are often short-lived and cleaned up afterward. The file deletions logged here might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nOn the other hand, PowerShell is a common tool for system administrators, so some of these actions could be legitimate. For instance, checking if certain files exist is part of script validation or setup processes. The events related to Windows Defender and system files don't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nI also notice that there's an `whoami.exe` process creation, which is a standard tool for determining user information. This alone isn't concerning unless it's used in conjunction with other malicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together, while some of the actions could be part of normal operations, others like file deletions and repeated checks for specific scripts raise flags. The combination of multiple PowerShell events, file manipulations, and registry changes is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. However, without more context or evidence of actual malicious behavior (like known malware signatures or exploit attempts), it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities exhibit patterns that could indicate potential malicious behavior. The confidence level isn't very high since there's no concrete evidence of harm, but the red flags are present enough to merit closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with suspicious activities including file creation\/deletion and repeated checks for specific files indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events from a JSONL file. The user wants me to analyze all the events together to see if they're interesting or not for investigation. They want just one classification: either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLet's start by going through each event one by one, but keeping in mind that I need to consider them as a whole.\n\nFirst event:\n- Process is powershell.exe checking if a script exists. If it does, exit 0; else, exit 1.\n- Winlog task is Provider Lifecycle.\n\nSecond event:\n- Powershell.exe with task Registry value set.\n\nThird event:\n- Powershell.exe creating a process with a command line that checks another path for the same script.\n- Task is Process Create.\n\nFourth and fifth events:\n- Powershell.exe being accessed, Process Access tasks.\n\nSixth to eleventh events:\n- Multiple Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. These seem normal as part of PowerShell execution.\n\nTwelfth event:\n- File created by powershell.exe for a temporary script.\n- Thirteenth: The same file is deleted immediately after creation.\n\nFourteenth and fifteenth events:\n- More Engine Lifecycle tasks in powershell.exe checking different paths for the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script.\n\nSixteenth event:\n- Powershell.exe loading another DLL related to Defender.\n\nSeventeenth event:\n- Winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file.\n\nNow, thinking about this as a whole. The repeated checks for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths suggests that the script might be trying to locate and execute itself. This is concerning because Get-Keystrokes sounds like it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is malicious behavior.\n\nThe file creation and deletion in the twelfth and thirteenth events indicate that the script is being tested or perhaps dropped into a temporary location. The fact that multiple paths are checked (registro_base, unidade_temporario, tarefa_temporario, etc.) suggests a persistence mechanism or an attempt to ensure the script is present wherever it runs.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe for such activities is common in attacks because PowerShell can execute scripts and has legitimate uses, making it harder to detect. The repeated process creations and file operations could be signs of malicious activity trying to establish persistence or gather information.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that these actions might not necessarily indicate malicious intent. For example, a script could be testing for its presence in different directories as part of setup or configuration. But given the nature of the script name (Get-Keystrokes), it's more likely malicious.\n\nThe confidence is high because multiple events relate to the same suspicious activity, including process creation, file operations, and repeated checks for a known malicious script.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes checking for the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths, along with temporary file creation and deletion activities. This behavior is indicative of potential malicious script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing processes and files. Then there are some normal executables like whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, chrome.exe, and svchost.exe performing various tasks.\n\nI notice that several events involve network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Network activity can be a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools to communicate with command and control servers. The repeated NetworkConnect events from chrome.exe might indicate unusual browsing behavior or potential malicious activity.\n\nAlso, powershell.exe is known for being used in scripting and automation but can also be abused for attacks due to its powerful features. The combination of multiple process accesses by powershell.exe and the network activities could hint at a possible attack vector.\n\nWhile there are some normal events like file creation and registry changes, the sheer number of network connections and powershell activities stands out. These might indicate command execution or data exfiltration attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple network connection events from chrome.exe and svchost.exe, along with several process access events involving powershell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm supposed to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. There are multiple instances where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that involve directory listings (`ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, `gci -recurse`). These commands could be part of a script to gather information about the system, which might indicate reconnaissance or data exfiltration activities.\n\n2. The batch includes events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and files. Registry modifications can be used for persistence, and file operations like creating and deleting temporary scripts (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1`) are common in malicious activities to avoid detection or to execute arbitrary code.\n\n3. There's a sequence of creating and then immediately deleting a script file. This behavior is suspicious because it might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies by temporarily storing malicious code that doesn't persist on disk, making it harder to detect later.\n\n4. The repeated \"Process Create\" events for PowerShell suggest multiple invocations or possible process injection techniques, which are common in attacks to evade detection mechanisms.\n\n5. Although there's a DNS query event from Chrome.exe, the majority of concerning activity revolves around PowerShell. Since attackers often chain together multiple tools and activities, even if one legitimate process is involved, the overall pattern with PowerShell needs closer examination.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems like this batch could indicate malicious behavior, especially since the actions taken by PowerShell are consistent with those used in attacks—such as file manipulation, registry changes, and script execution. The combination of these activities across multiple events increases the likelihood that something suspicious is happening.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that they're a cybersecurity expert analyzing JSONL logs for malicious behavior. They want me to look at all the events together and decide if the whole batch is worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few events: there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines like 'ls -recurse' or 'get-childitem -recurse'. These commands usually list files and directories, which isn't inherently malicious, but repeated use might indicate something. Also, some of these PowerShell executions have different tasks in the winlog field—like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, etc.\n\nThen there are events where other processes like winlogbeat.exe and conhost.exe are involved. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting Windows logs, so its activity shouldn't raise red flags on its own. Conhost.exe is often used by PowerShell to run scripts without the GUI, which can be common in automation but might also be used maliciously.\n\nI notice that there are several file-related events. For example, winlogbeat creating a configuration file and powershell creating some profile data files. These could just be normal operations, especially if someone is setting up log collection tools or running PowerShell scripts during system administration tasks.\n\nThere's also a file named 'estrutura_secundario.txt' being created by powershell.exe. The filename doesn't seem suspicious at first glance, but without more context, it's hard to say. It could be part of a legitimate script or data backup.\n\nRegistry value sets are happening with both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be common in malicious activities to maintain persistence, but again, they're not conclusive on their own. Legitimate software also modifies the registry for configuration purposes.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of certain processes and tasks. Multiple entries show powershell.exe being used, which could be a red flag if it's part of an attack chain, like credential dumping or lateral movement. However, without seeing commands that perform such actions (like Invoke-Mimikatz or exfiltration attempts), it's hard to classify these events as malicious.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, there's a mix of legitimate-looking activities and potentially suspicious ones. The repeated use of PowerShell with file system enumeration could indicate reconnaissance or data gathering, which is often part of an attack. However, without evidence of harmful actions like writing files, deleting data, or communication with external servers, it's still ambiguous.\n\nI'm considering the confidence level here. While there are signs that might warrant closer inspection, such as repeated PowerShell use and registry modifications, they aren't definitive proof of malicious activity. It could also be a user running legitimate scripts or system administration tasks.\n\nOn the other hand, the combination of multiple events related to process creation, file operations, and registry changes from powershell.exe does raise some concern. This might indicate a possible attack, especially if these activities occur in a short timeframe and involve uncommon commands.\n\nBut wait, looking again at the command lines: they're using standard cmdlets for listing files and directories. So it's more about file enumeration rather than anything malicious. The lack of unusual commands or actions makes me think this might not be an attack after all.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some elements that could suggest potential issues, without clear indicators of compromise, the batch as a whole doesn't strongly indicate malicious behavior. Therefore, I'd classify it as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a lower confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate system activity, including PowerShell command execution and file creation by winlogbeat.exe. No evidence of malicious behavior is present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
