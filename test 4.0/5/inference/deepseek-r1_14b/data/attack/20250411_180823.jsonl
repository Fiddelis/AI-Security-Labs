{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections and a DNS query. That's pretty normal for a browser, so nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nThen, RuntimeBroker.exe is modifying the registry. Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process, so registry changes aren't unusual unless they're part of something malicious, but alone, this isn't concerning.\n\nNotepad.exe also makes a registry change. Notepad is a simple text editor; it shouldn't be making such changes unless there's some script or macro running. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing processes catches my eye because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution. However, in this case, the log just shows process access, which could be legitimate admin activity or something else. I'll keep an eye on how this plays out.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems odd because Calculator isn't supposed to load DLLs related to URL handling. That's a red flag. Maybe it's part of some malicious activity, but I need more context.\n\nLooking further, cmd.exe is used with schtasks to create new tasks that run calc.exe on startup or logon. This is definitely suspicious because creating scheduled tasks via command line can be a way for malware to persist across reboots. The fact that they're using system-level commands and running calc.exe suggests possible malicious intent.\n\nThere are multiple instances where schtasks.exe creates tasks with names like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" pointing to cmd.exe and calc.exe. This repetition is concerning because it might indicate automated task creation, which is a common tactic in attacks for persistence.\n\nAdditionally, svchost.exe, known for hosting system services but also often used by malware to hide malicious activities, has several registry modifications and file creations. The file created is under the Tasks directory with an unusual name, which could be part of a persistent backdoor or dropper.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple events involving process creation, registry changes, and scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe are strong indicators of potential malware activity. The use of legitimate tools like schtasks and cmd in a way that's outside normal user behavior is a big red flag. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell process access, command-line execution of calc.exe via schtasks, and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. So, I'm given a bunch of log events in JSONL format, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. The output should be just one result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually and see what's happening. Let me list them out:\n\n1. svchost.exe setting a registry value.\n2. Same as above, repeated three times.\n3. Another svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks folder.\n4. cmd.exe setting a registry value.\n5. conhost.exe doing the same.\n6. svchost.exe again with another registry set.\n7. ApplicationFrameHost.exe also modifying registry.\n8. Calculator.exe as well.\n9. Powershell.exe making changes.\n10. Another powershell.exe accessing something, maybe process injection?\n11. Chrome.exe creating a pipe and setting reg values multiple times.\n12. A file creation by winlogbeat.exe which seems benign.\n13-14: More chrome.exe loading DLLs.\n15. Powershell.exe creating a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt'.\n16-17: Chrome continues with registry changes.\n\nOkay, so the first thing I notice is that svchost.exe and powershell.exe are often used by malware because they're legitimate processes but can execute malicious code. The fact that they're setting registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes for malicious activities.\n\nThe repeated registry writes from chrome.exe might seem suspicious too, as browsers aren't usually that active in the registry unless there's some extension or injected script causing it. Also, powershell.exe creating a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' catches my attention because powershell is a common tool for executing scripts, and the filename seems arbitrary but could be malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, some events are normal system operations. For example, winlogbeat.exe creating config files is part of its data collection process. Chrome loading DLLs like amsi.dll or MpOAV.dll is standard for anti-malware components.\n\nSo, weighing these points: while there are red flags with svchost and powershell activities, the overall batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious behavior together. It's possible that some processes are legitimate but could be part of an attack. However, without more context or evidence of anomalies like multiple failed attempts, unusual file paths, or known bad indicators, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting.\n\nI think the confidence level is moderate because while there are suspicious points, they might not all be malicious. It's a bit on the fence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe and powershell.exe performing registry modifications could indicate potential malicious activity. The creation of files by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, along with unusual file names like 'unidade_ativo.txt', adds suspicion. Additionally, Chrome's repeated registry writes and loading of system DLLs might be part of a broader attack pattern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one. The first seven entries are all from 'chrome.exe' with the task being 'Registry value set'. That seems normal because Chrome might update its settings or extensions could modify registry values. Not too suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an entry from 'powershell.exe' with a 'Process accessed' task. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. It's often associated with script execution, which can be bad if the scripts are malicious.\n\nThe next event is 'whoami.exe' being executed. 'Whoami' typically retrieves user information, but in some cases, it could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering by attackers. However, standalone use might not be enough to classify as malicious unless combined with other activities.\n\nLooking further, there's another PowerShell access and a Chrome event again. So overall, we have multiple instances of both Chrome and PowerShell activity, plus one 'whoami.exe' execution.\n\nI should consider the combination of these events. The repeated registry modifications in Chrome could be part of a legitimate update or they might be something more nefarious, like persistence mechanisms for malware. The presence of multiple PowerShell accesses is concerning because attackers often use it to execute commands and move laterally within a network.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' execution adds another layer. While not inherently malicious, when combined with the other activities, especially from PowerShell, it could indicate an attack chainâ€”like initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple red flags: use of PowerShell (potentially for scripting), repeated registry changes in Chrome which might be trying to establish persistence, and the 'whoami' command. These collectively suggest possible malicious activity rather than normal system operations.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or additional events showing other suspicious behaviors, it's hard to be certain. But based on what's provided, the combination does raise enough concerns to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' modifying registry values and 'powershell.exe' accessing processes, along with a single execution of 'whoami.exe'. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
