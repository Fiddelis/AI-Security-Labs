{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that does a lot of network activity and DNS lookups. So these might just be regular browsing activities.\n\nThen I notice some events from powershell.exe. The first one under 'winlog' shows 'Registry value set', which could be suspicious, but sometimes legitimate scripts modify the registry. But then there's another event where powershell is run with a command line that includes downloading files from GitHub. That sounds more concerning because downloading files automatically, especially from raw.githubusercontent.com, might indicate script execution.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines in the process events, I see commands like (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile() which is a common technique used by scripts to download files. The paths being downloaded are LICENSE.txt files, but those could be part of larger malicious payloads or just placeholders. It's possible that these downloads are attempting to retrieve additional code or modules.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created and then deleted in the Temp directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1. That seems unusual because creating and immediately deleting files, especially script files, could be part of evading detection mechanisms. This might suggest that the script is attempting to test policy enforcement or remove traces after execution.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, in the context of a script being executed, it could be part of obfuscation techniques or executing malicious code in memory.\n\nFurthermore, there are Provider Lifecycle tasks logged, which might not be directly indicative but combined with the other events, they add to the suspicion that something unusual is happening. The repeated use of powershell.exe with similar command structures suggests a possible automated process or script execution.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used to download files from GitHub and execute them. These activities could be part of malicious behavior such as downloading malware components or scripts intended to perform unauthorized actions on the system. The creation and deletion of temporary script files also raise red flags about potential exploit attempts.\n\nTherefore, considering all these events collectively, there's a strong indication that this batch is indicative of malicious activity, making it relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances downloading files from GitHub and executing them, combined with file creation\/deletion in Temp directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events show PowerShell executing commands that download files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different branches and paths. This is a red flag because downloading files via PowerShell could indicate malicious activity, like script execution or file downloads from suspicious sources.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' and another with 'Engine Lifecycle'. These relate to how Windows services start up, which might be normal during system boot or updates. But combined with the download activities, it's something to watch.\n\nThen I see several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does update its settings via the Registry, multiple such events in a row could indicate an unusual number of changes, possibly from malicious scripts altering configurations.\n\nThere are also some file creation events for PowerShell and a Dns query event, which is normal but again, when paired with other suspicious activities, adds to the concern. The last few entries involve a legitimate tool like winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files, so those aren't worrying on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub, changes in registry by Chrome, and overall unusual file operations. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity or at least something out of the ordinary that deserves closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to download files from external repositories, combined with registry modifications and file creations, indicate potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see that powershell.exe is creating files and accessing processes multiple times. Powershell can be legitimate but also often used in attacks. The file paths like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_base.txt' might be suspicious if they're unexpected on the system. Then there's a cmd.exe command deleting a task using SCHTASKS, which could indicate an attempt to remove scheduled tasks that might be malicious.\n\nThere are several instances of Registry value sets and accesses by processes like powershell.exe, svchost.exe, and others. These activities can be red flags because attackers often modify the registry to hide their presence or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nNotably, there's a whoami.exe execution which is typically used to check user privileges but could also be part of malicious activity to gather information.\n\nWhile some events like file creations by winlogbeat.exe and image loads seem benign (like urlmon.dll), the combination of multiple powershell.exe activities, registry modifications, and task deletions raises concerns. These behaviors together might suggest potential malware or attack activities, especially if these processes are running without clear justification.\n\nOverall, the pattern seems concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe process creations and deletions of scheduled tasks using SCHTASKS.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at each event:\n\n1. conhost.exe setting a registry value.\n2. powershell.exe being accessed.\n3. whoami.exe running with no command line details.\n4. Another powershell.exe access.\n5. Powershell again setting a registry value.\n6. cmd.exe deleting a registry entry related to the Run key.\n7.

Same as above, repeated multiple times.\n18. Powershell creating a process.\n19. Powershell accessed.\n20. Powershell setting registry value.\n21. Powershell loading mscoree.dll.\n\nNow, thinking about what's happening here: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing the registry, especially targeting the Run key. This is suspicious because attackers often use the Run key to persist malicious processes. The repeated deletions suggest an attempt to remove traces or prevent detection.\n\nThe use of conhost.exe is notable too. It's known for being used in some attacks as a legitimate process that can be abused. Powershell with command lines like \"& {\" could be obfuscating commands, which is a common tactic for hiding malicious activities.\n\nMultiple Process Creates and Registry events indicate potential tampering with system configurations. The repeated attempts to modify the registry might be part of an attack chain trying to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nGiven all these points, the combination suggests possible malicious activity, such as installing backdoors or ransomware components. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe accessing and modifying the registry, particularly targeting persistence mechanisms in the Run key, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. The user has provided multiple JSONL entries, each representing different system activities. My task is to analyze all these events collectively and determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events are related to `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers for lateral movement and execution of malicious scripts. The fact that there are several entries with `powershell.exe` suggests potential concern, especially if these activities are out of the ordinary.\n\nLooking closer at the events involving `powershell.exe`, I see tasks like Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, Registry value set, and Process accessed. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious but could be indicators of something suspicious when combined. For instance, creating a temporary file, deleting it immediately, and using pipes could be part of a script's execution flow.\n\nThere are also entries where `powershell.exe` is run with an empty command line (`& {}`). This might indicate that the process is being kicked off without executing any specific commands, which isn't typical. Alternatively, it could be part of legitimate scripting, but it's worth noting as unusual behavior.\n\nAnother point to consider is the creation and deletion of files in temporary directories. The file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1` appears briefly and then gets deleted. This might be a test script being run, possibly to check permissions or bypass certain security policies. Such actions are often part of attackers' tactics to ensure they can execute code without detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity involving `cmd.exe`, specifically with an empty command line (`\/c`). This is odd because `\/c` typically runs a command and then exits, but without any command specified, it might be used as a vector for further actions or to launch other tools covertly.\n\nThe use of `whoami.exe` could be another red flag. While this tool is often used to check user privileges, in the context of these logs, it might indicate an attempt to gather information about the current user's permissions, which is a common step in lateral movement.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there are multiple indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity. The combination of PowerShell usage with atypical command lines, temporary file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and use of other tools like `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe` creates a concerning pattern. However, it's possible that some of these actions could be part of legitimate system administration tasks or automated scripts.\n\nTo determine the confidence level, I assess the likelihood that this batch indicates malicious behavior. The sheer number of suspicious activities related to process creation, file operations, and registry changes increases the concern. While each event might not individually warrant investigation, their collective nature strongly suggests a need for closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with atypical command lines, temporary file creation\/deletion, and other indicators suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving different processes. The first event is cmd.exe setting a registry value, and then conhost.exe doing the same. That already piques my interest because unusual activity in the Registry can be indicative of malicious behavior, especially when combined with other events.\n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being executed. This is a legitimate system command used to get user information, but it's often used by attackers to gather information about the current user or system. The fact that it's being run without any obvious reason could warrant further investigation.\n\nThen, I see several instances of powershell.exe being launched with different command lines and tasks. Powershell is a powerful tool and commonly exploited for attacks due to its scripting capabilities. The events show powershell.exe accessing processes, setting registry values, loading images, and even creating and deleting temporary files. The creation and deletion of a script in the Temp directory (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1) is concerning because it suggests that a script was executed temporarily, which could be part of an attack to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is called with \"& {}\" as the command line. This syntax doesn't execute any code immediately but might be used in a pipeline or to launch another process, which can be a tactic to hide malicious activities or to download additional components.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks under powershell.exe are also suspicious. Providers in Windows are related to event tracing and could be misused by attackers for logging or persistence mechanisms.\n\nFurthermore, the events show various image loads from different paths, including .NET framework files and Defender-related DLLs. While some of these are legitimate, others might be attempts to load malicious libraries or bypass security measures.\n\nThe combination of multiple registry modifications, process creations, file operations, and powershell activities all point towards potential malicious behavior. Each event on its own might not raise too many red flags, but when taken together, they form a pattern that's worth investigating. The use of temporary files, especially with .ps1 extensions, is another red flag because it's common in script-based attacks.\n\nI also notice that some processes are trying to access and modify the registry, which is a common technique for installing malware or creating persistence points. Registry modifications can be hard to detect and often serve as a way to keep malicious processes alive across reboots.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event might not be outright malicious, the overall pattern—especially the extensive use of powershell.exe with various command-line arguments and associated file operations—suggests that there's something worth looking into. The repeated attempts to create and delete files in the Temp directory, combined with process creation events and registry modifications, make this batch of logs particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including registry manipulation, file operations, and temporary script creation suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from Calculator.exe and Chrome.exe setting registry values and creating pipes. That seems a bit unusual because I don't recall Calculator.exe typically doing much beyond its basic function. But maybe it's part of some legitimate activity? Chrome accessing the registry might be for plugin installations or extensions, so that could be normal.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe entries. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers, but it can also be used legitimately. The events show tasks like Pipe Created, Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created, and Engine Lifecycle. Some of these actions might be part of normal operations, especially if scripts are running.\n\nLooking at the command lines for powershell.exe, I see \"& {}\" in some cases, which is a way to run commands without displaying them in the console. This could be indicative of malicious activity trying to hide its process. Also, one event shows \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip\", which deletes a file from the TEMP directory. That command is suspicious because it's deleting a specific file; if that file wasn't supposed to be there, it could be part of an attack.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that powershell.exe is accessing other processes and loading various DLLs. The paths like \"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\...\" seem legitimate, but sometimes attackers might use these legitimate locations to hide their activities or drop malicious files there.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process being created, which could be used to gather user information, potentially for lateral movement in an attack. That adds another layer of concern because it's a common tool used by both admins and attackers for privilege escalation.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell instances with hidden commands, file deletions, registry modifications, accessing other processes, and using whoami.exe—this combination raises red flags. It seems like a sequence that could be part of an attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile some individual actions might not be suspicious on their own, the pattern over time is concerning. The repeated use of powershell with potentially malicious commands and the interaction between different processes make this batch stand out as possibly indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, including deletion of files and registry modifications, alongside other process creations and accesses that suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events from the system logs. The first thing that catches my eye is the repeated use of powershell.exe across multiple entries. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting, but it's also commonly abused by attackers for command-line attacks and lateral movement.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET framework components. While these might seem normal, the fact that they're being loaded repeatedly could indicate something suspicious, such as a script trying to establish persistence or load malicious modules.\n\nThere's also a series of events where powershell.exe is deleting files in the TEMP directory. Specifically, commands like Remove-Item are used with paths pointing to .zip files. This behavior raises red flags because attackers often delete traces of their activities to avoid detection. The fact that multiple different zip files are being deleted suggests a pattern that might be part of a broader malicious activity, such as dropping and then removing payloads.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where a PowerShell script is created in the TEMP directory but then immediately deleted. This temporary file creation and deletion could be a tactic to test if certain actions are allowed or to bypass some security policies. The presence of these files being quickly removed might indicate an attempt to avoid detection mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and sequence, it seems like this activity isn't isolated. The repeated use of powershell.exe with different commands points towards a potential script running multiple actions in succession. This kind of behavior is often seen in automated attack scripts or during lateral movement within a network.\n\nWhile some of these activities could be legitimate (like using PowerShell for system administration tasks), the combination—repeated loading of specific DLLs, deletion of temporary files, and the use of command-line arguments to remove multiple files—is concerning. These actions don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate an attempt at covering tracks or executing malicious code.\n\nMoreover, the involvement of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll in some events might be part of normal operations, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern. Attackers sometimes abuse legitimate processes or tools to hide their activity.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows a pattern of behavior that is atypical for normal system usage and aligns with known tactics used by cyber attackers.

That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Then there are some conhost.exe and whoami.exe processes, which on their own aren't suspicious, but when combined with other actions might raise an eyebrow.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe deletes files in the TEMP directory. Specifically, they're removing files like .txt with names like tarefa_base.txt or estrutura_ativo.txt. These file names don’t seem to have any clear legitimate purpose, especially if they’re being deleted immediately after creation. The fact that these deletions are logged as FileDeleteDetected suggests the system detected them as significant enough to log.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines that execute scripts. The script paths in TEMP might indicate they were executed and then deleted, which could be a common tactic to avoid detection by having less persistence in logs. This behavior is often used by malware to clean up after themselves or remove traces of their activities.\n\nLooking at the image loading events for mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components, this isn't unusual as PowerShell relies on these libraries. However, combined with all the deletions and repeated process creations, it makes me think there's more going on here than just normal script execution.\n\nThe fact that multiple processes are being created (like ProcessCreate events) and then immediately accessing registry values or other system components could indicate some form of privilege escalation or persistence mechanism. Malicious actors often use such techniques to ensure their code runs at higher privileges or survives reboots.\n\nOverall, the combination of PowerShell activity, file deletions in TEMP, repeated process creations, and registry modifications suggests potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is PowerShell.exe with command lines removing files from the TEMP directory. The tasks are either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These look like normal operations because scripts often clean up temporary files. However, since they're using specific filenames ending with .txt and all in TEMP, it might be something automated.\n\nNext, there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. That seems legitimate as part of log shipping tools.\n\nThen, there are several entries where processes like chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are setting registry values. These are common actions for applications to configure settings or update their configurations, so they might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nI also notice a process called whoami.exe being executed, which is usually used to check user permissions. It's a standard command and not typically malicious unless used in an unusual context.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell activities: there are multiple instances of creating files and accessing processes. Some of these could be part of legitimate script execution or user activity. The fact that they're using 'Remove-Item' might raise flags, but if it's part of a routine cleanup process, it's not concerning.\n\nAnother point is that all the file paths seem to be standard locations like TEMP, Downloads, and AppData, which are typical places for applications and scripts to write files. There's no indication of writing to system directories or other red flag locations.\n\nThe justification here would be whether these actions collectively indicate malicious behavior. While individual events could look suspicious, together they don't necessarily point to an attack. The combination includes both PowerShell activity and legitimate processes, but without evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malicious file creation, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting.\n\nI'd rate the confidence low because there's no clear pattern of malicious intent across these events. They could easily be part of normal system operations or script executions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system operations, including legitimate PowerShell commands for file removal and application processes like Chrome setting registry values.

The whoami.exe runs normally to get user info, which isn't alarming.\n\nThen there are some events from winlogbeat creating files in its data directory.
