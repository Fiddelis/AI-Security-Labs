{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking through the events, I notice that there are several instances where PowerShell.exe is being accessed. For example:\n\n1. {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n2. Another similar event with Powershell accessing again.\n\nI also see that whoami.exe and cmd.exe are being run, specifically looking at their command lines:\n\n- {\"process\":\"{'name': 'whoami.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n- {\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"cmd.exe\\\" \\\/c attrib.exe +h %%temp%%\\\\estrutura_padrao.txt'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n\nThe cmd.exe command looks suspicious because it's using the \/c option to execute another command, which is 'attrib.exe' with some parameters. The 'attrib +h' part suggests that it's trying to set the hidden attribute on a file named something like estrutura_padrao.txt in the Temp directory. Hiding files can be a tactic used by malware or attackers to remain undetected.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where processes are accessing registry values and creating pipes. For example:\n\n- {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n- Similarly, cmd.exe and other executables like conhost.exe also show Registry value sets.\n\nThese activities could be normal system operations, but the combination might indicate something more nefarious. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or hide its tracks.\n\nI also notice that there's an event involving 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file:\n\n- {\"process\":\"{'name': 'winlogbeat.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'}\"}\n\nWinlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting Windows logs, so that event might be benign.\n\nThere are several entries where 'chrome.exe' is accessing registry values repeatedly:\n\n{\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n\nWhile Chrome can interact with the registry for various reasons, multiple such events could be worth looking into if they're unusual.\n\nLooking at other processes like Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing registry values seems a bit odd. These are typically innocent applications, so seeing them making registry changes might indicate something suspicious.\n\nOverall, while some of these events on their own might not raise red flags, the combination—especially the use of Powershell, cmd.exe with hidden file operations, multiple Registry modifications by various processes, and repeated actions from non-standard apps—points towards potential malicious activity. This could be an indication of a compromise or at least exploratory behavior that merits closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including Powershell.exe accesses, cmd.exe commands attempting to hide files, and repeated registry modifications. These could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first two events are from chrome.exe loading images into memory. That's pretty standard because Chrome loads a lot of DLLs for its functionality. The third event is chrome.exe setting a registry value, which also seems normal as applications often interact with the registry.\n\nNext, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping, so that's expected behavior. Then, powershell.exe creates a new file named pacote_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. However, without additional context, this could just be a script running.\n\nThere are multiple events where chrome.exe sets registry values repeatedly—like seven times in a row. While Chrome does interact with the registry, such repeated writes might raise an eyebrow, but it's not necessarily malicious unless they're modifying sensitive areas.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event shows process access, which is typical for scripts that need to interact with other processes. Then there's whoami.exe being run from the command line without any arguments. Whoami is a common tool used by both admins and attackers to check permissions, so this alone isn't suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nFinally, another powershell.exe process access event follows. \n\nLooking at the batch as a whole, most events are normal system activities. The repeated registry writes by Chrome could be a point of interest but might not indicate malicious activity on their own. The use of PowerShell and whoami.exe doesn't provide enough context to label them as suspicious. Without evidence of other anomalies or deviations from baseline behavior, the overall batch doesn't seem particularly concerning.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because each event individually is normal and there's no clear indication of malicious behavior when considering all events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of standard system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and the use of common tools like PowerShell and Chrome. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or unusual patterns that would indicate a security incident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
