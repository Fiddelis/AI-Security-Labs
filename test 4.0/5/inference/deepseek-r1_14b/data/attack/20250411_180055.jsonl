{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events are related to PowerShell.exe processes. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators, but it can also be abused by attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts.\n\nLooking closer, there are several instances where powershell.exe is accessing system files and registry values. For example, there's an event where powershell.exe accesses mscoree.dll, which is associated with .NET framework components. This could be part of legitimate operations but also might indicate code execution if the context isn't clear.\n\nI spot a few Process Create events for powershell.exe, each with command lines that include Compress-Archive commands. These are typically used to create ZIP archives. However, when combined with other activities like file creation and deletion in temporary directories, this could be a sign of malicious activity such as packing files into archives and then deleting the original script files to cover tracks.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated pattern of creating and then deleting temporary files, like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1'. This behavior might suggest that an attacker is trying to test the system's PowerShell policy or attempting to clean up evidence after executing a script.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this is normal for running scripts, the sheer number and combination with other activities could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several signs of potential malicious behavior: repeated PowerShell executions, file compression, temporary file operations, and registry access. These actions don't seem to align with typical user or administrative activity, making the batch of events worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes accessing system files and registry values, creating and deleting temporary files, and using Compress-Archive commands suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events where PowerShell is being executed with the Compress-Archive command. This seems suspicious because attackers often use compression tools to package malicious files for exfiltration. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\pacote_logico\\unidade_auxiliar\\modulo_principal\\bin\\tarefa_geral\", look arbitrary and could be hiding malicious activities.\n\nNext, I see multiple events with the same task names like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are common in normal operations, but when combined with the PowerShell commands, they might indicate script execution or module loading. The repeated use of these tasks without other context makes me think there's a pattern here that could be malicious.\n\nLooking at the files involved, most have \"None\" for file data except a few. One event shows a file path related to Windows Defender's MpClient.dll being loaded by PowerShell. This is unusual because legitimate scripts typically don't interact with antivirus components unless they're trying to evade detection or modify system behavior.\n\nThere are also events where other processes like winlogbeat.exe, conhost.exe, and calc.exe are involved. While some of these might be benign, the combination with PowerShell activities raises red flags. Notably, there's a Registry value set event for both PowerShell and conhost.exe, which could indicate an attempt to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nThe repeated use of Compress-Archive across different paths suggests that multiple files or directories are being compressed into ZIP files in the TEMP directory. This is concerning because it's a common tactic for attackers to compress stolen data before sending it out. The consistent destination path ($env:TEMP) adds to this suspicion, as malicious scripts often use temporary folders to avoid detection.\n\nFurthermore, the event where PowerShell accesses another process (ProcessAccess) might be an indicator of lateral movement or privilege escalation. This could mean that the script is trying to interact with other running processes, which is a red flag for potential exploitation.\n\nWhile there are legitimate reasons why some of these events might occur, like system updates or user actions, the volume and combination of these specific activities lean heavily towards malicious behavior. The use of PowerShell with compression commands in various directories, coupled with registry modifications and process interactions, makes this batch highly indicative of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell events with Compress-Archive command targeting different paths, combined with file creation and registry activity, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. That seems a bit suspicious because svchost is often used by malware since it's a legitimate Windows process that can be hijacked. But then again, sometimes legitimate software uses svchost for services. However, repeated Registry modifications might indicate malicious activity.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll doesn't raise immediate red flags, as system32 files are standard. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory is probably just the setup process, so that's normal.\n\nI notice a lot of events from chrome.exe setting registry values and loading various DLLs. Chrome is a common application, and it does interact with the registry for settings and extensions, but the sheer number of these events (like 13 times) might be unusual unless someone is doing a lot of extension installations or updates.\n\nThere are also some powershell.exe entries, both setting registry values and accessing processes. PowerShell can be used maliciously, so any process accesses or creations by it could be red flags. The fact that whoami.exe was run from the command line is another point; while whoami is a legitimate tool for checking user information, it's often used in scripts to gather system info which might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of svchost and powershell activities, along with unusual registry writes and process creations. This combination suggests possible malicious behavior. However, some events could also be normal user activity, like using Chrome a lot or legitimate script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe performing registry modifications and process accesses, which may indicate potential malicious activities. Additionally, the creation of files by winlogbeat.exe and the execution of whoami.exe add to the suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
