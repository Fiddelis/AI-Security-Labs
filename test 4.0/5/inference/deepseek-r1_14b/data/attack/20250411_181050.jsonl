{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a DNS query from chrome.exe. That seems normal since browsers do that regularly. Next, whoami.exe is run, which could be used by legitimate users or scripts to check permissions, but it's not inherently malicious unless misused.\n\nThen, powershell.exe appears multiple times with different tasks—accessed and registry events. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad purposes. The fact that it's being accessed might raise an eyebrow, especially if combined with other activities.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is part of the ELK stack for log management, so that should be expected in a system using these tools. No immediate red flags there.\n\nLooking further, cmd.exe and certutil.exe are used. Certutil is a legitimate Windows tool but can be abused for malicious activities like encoding or decoding files. The command lines show they're being used to encode\/decode calc.exe, which seems suspicious. Encoding files is often part of an attack chain, maybe preparing a payload.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing processes and registry events adds up, especially with the cmd.exe using certutil in ways that could be obfuscating malicious code. The multiple Registry value sets by various processes might indicate persistence mechanisms or attempts to hide traces.\n\nThere's also a rundll32.exe call to PcaSvc.dll, which is known for legitimate patching tasks but sometimes exploited. Additionally, SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs doesn't immediately seem bad, but repeated ImageLoad events could be part of a broader malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of certutil being used with cmd to encode and decode files suggests possible payload creation. PowerShell's involvement might be for executing commands or lateral movement. The registry modifications could be setting up persistence or cleaning logs. These activities, while not conclusive on their own, collectively point towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm 80% confident because there are legitimate uses for each of these tools and events, but the combination—especially the file encoding with certutil and cmd, along with PowerShell access—strongly suggests something is amiss.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including use of certutil.exe for file encoding\/decoding, PowerShell process accesses, and registry modifications, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections detected. That's four times in a row. Then, another event with powershell.exe creating a file called componente_auxiliar.txt in the Downloads folder. After that, more chrome.exe events about setting registry values—six times. There's also an SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a system file, so that seems normal. Winlogbeat.exe created a config file, which makes sense if it's running as part of log management.\n\nThen there are two more powershell.exe events: one creating a registry value and another accessing a process. \n\nHmm, I need to see if these events together indicate something malicious. Chrome.exe is common and usually handles network connections and registry writes during operation, especially when updating or handling extensions. The file creation by powershell.exe could be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the rest of the events don't show any other signs of compromise like multiple processes accessing sensitive files or unusual network traffic.\n\nI think this batch doesn't indicate malicious activity because each event individually is something a legitimate process would do, and there's no combination that raises a red flag. So, I'd classify it as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal activities such as network connections from chrome.exe, file creation by powershell.exe for a benign-sounding file, and registry operations which are typical. No evidence of malicious behavior is present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
