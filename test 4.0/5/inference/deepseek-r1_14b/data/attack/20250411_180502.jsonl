{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm seeing a batch of events from different processes and Windows logs. The first few entries are all from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That might just be regular browsing activity, so not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen there's a shift to powershell.exe events. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to pay attention here. Looking at the command lines, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe starts processes with arguments pointing to .bat files in various directories like C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\unidade_comum etc.\n\nThe paths seem to be navigating up directories using \"..\", which could indicate attempts to access different parts of the filesystem. The fact that these commands are executed via powershell's process creation and access rules raises a red flag because attackers often use such techniques for lateral movement or persistence.\n\nAdditionally, I notice file creations and deletions in temporary folders, like creating __PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1 and then deleting it shortly after. This is a common tactic to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces on the system.\n\nThe registry access events also stand out. Malware often modifies the registry to maintain persistence or configure settings for malicious activities. The repeated ImageLoad tasks with various DLLs could be indicative of loading malicious libraries or hooks into the process.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern suggests a possible script execution via powershell that's attempting to run arbitrary commands across different filesystem locations. This combination of events—process creation, registry modifications, file operations in temp directories—isn't typical for normal user activity and aligns with behaviors seen in malicious scripts or payloads. The use of multiple .bat files could be part of a larger attack chain or attempts to execute malicious code in different contexts.\n\nGiven all these points, the batch definitely warrants further investigation as it exhibits signs of potentially malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command lines executing other scripts, file operations, and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, several entries show powershell.exe being used with command lines that start other .bat scripts. This is a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when executing bat files which can be part of scripting attacks.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe accessing the registry repeatedly. While Chrome does interact with the registry, multiple such events might indicate unusual behavior, possibly tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI notice that some processes like Calculator.exe and conhost.exe are also accessing the registry, which is a bit odd since they're typically benign apps. This could be an attempt to hide malicious activities by blending in with normal processes.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe runs a batch file, which again is suspicious because command-line tools are often used in attacks. Plus, there's a file creation event by powershell.exe into the Startup folder, which is a common method for persistence across reboots.\n\nThe events show various tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image Load, and File Create. These types of activities can be indicators of malicious behavior, especially when multiple suspicious processes are involved.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of PowerShell executing scripts, other legitimate tools being used in ways that don't align with typical operations, and registry modifications that might be setting up persistence or lateral movement within the system. This combination suggests potential malicious activity, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing bat files, repeated registry accesses, and other potentially malicious activities detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and chrome.exe all setting registry values. That doesn't immediately seem suspicious because these processes can do that during normal operation. But I should keep an eye out for repeated actions from the same process.\n\nNext, there are several chrome.exe entries loading amsi.dll and another Defender-related DLL. Those look like legitimate system files that Chrome might interact with. No red flags here.\n\nThen, svchost.exe creates a file in the NetworkService's AppData folder. Svchost is known for running various services, so creating files there isn't unusual unless it's doing something unexpected.\n\nThere are two powershell.exe events creating files in the user's Downloads folder. Powershell can do a lot, both legitimate and malicious. Creating text files here might be normal if someone is scripting or downloading content, but it could also indicate command execution.\n\nThe next several events are all chrome.exe setting registry values again. That repetition stands out to me because multiple registry changes in quick succession from the same process could be a sign of something malicious, like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that shouldn't happen often.\n\nFinally, winlogbeat.exe creates its own config file, which makes sense if it's part of log management software running on the system. No issues there.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated registry writes from chrome.exe are concerning. While some might be normal, multiple instances could indicate tampering or malicious activity trying to establish persistence. Additionally, powershell.exe creating files in Downloads isn't inherently suspicious but combined with the other events raises the overall concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications from Chrome.exe and suspicious file creations by PowerShell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
