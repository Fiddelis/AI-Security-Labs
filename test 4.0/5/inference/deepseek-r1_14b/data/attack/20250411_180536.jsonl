{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several events from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do a lot of that. But then, when I see other processes like powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe being used, that raises my eyebrows a bit more.\n\nPowershell is commonly used for scripting and can be abused by attackers, so its presence in logs is something to note. Similarly, command-line tools like cmd.exe and sc.exe are often used for system administration but could also be part of malicious activities, especially when combined with creating or starting services.\n\nLooking at the commands run by these processes, I see things like creating new services with specific commands. For example, \"sc.exe create\" and then setting them to start automatically. That's a red flag because attackers often use such techniques to maintain persistence on a system. Services that start automatically can be used to reinfect a machine after a reboot.\n\nThere are also events where registry values are being set by various processes, including services.exe multiple times. Modifying the registry is another common tactic for attackers to install backdoors or modify system configurations without user consent.\n\nAdditionally, there are image load events from .NET framework components like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. While these are legitimate, they can sometimes be used by malicious software as part of their operation, especially if loaded by suspicious processes.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using powershell.exe for process access and registry modifications, creating new services with specific commands, and loading .NET components could indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated creation of services and registry changes are concerning behaviors that merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, sc.exe for service creation, registry modifications, and loading .NET components which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved, there are a lot of common executables like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, etc. These aren't immediately suspicious on their own because they're standard Windows processes.\n\nThe events are mainly about tasks related to image loading and registry value changes. For example, Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad) indicates that a process is loading a DLL or another module, which is normal for most applications. The files being loaded seem typical too, like mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, urlmon.dll, etc., all of which are legitimate system files.\n\nThere are some registry value sets (rule: RegistryEvent). These could be part of normal operation as processes often modify the registry during their runtime. However, multiple such events from different processes might warrant closer inspection if they seem unusual together. But in this case, each is standalone and points to standard operations like configuration changes or initialization.\n\nLooking at winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool used for collecting Windows logs, so it's expected that it writes files during operation. There's no indication here of any malicious activity with this process; it's doing what it's supposed to do.\n\nPowershell.exe has a few events: registry value set and process access. While PowerShell can be used for malicious purposes, not all usage is bad. It's often used by admins for legitimate tasks. The event types don't suggest any command execution or suspicious activity in this case; they look like normal operation.\n\nsvchost.exe is known to host various Windows services. Multiple registry events here might be part of service initialization or updates. Since svchost can sometimes be exploited, but the events themselves don't show anything malicious, like creating new keys that are not standard.\n\nThere's also a file creation event from winlogbeat, which seems legitimate as mentioned before. The other file loads are all system-related, which is normal behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual process interactions, such as processes spawning others in an unexpected way or accessing restricted resources. No network activity is logged here, so no red flags there either.\n\nConsidering the entire batch, the events look like a mix of standard system operations and legitimate tool activities (like winlogbeat). While each individual event might be notable on its own, together they don't present a cohesive pattern indicative of malicious behavior. The only thing that stands out is the number of registry changes, but since these are spread across different processes and none seem out of place, it's not a concern.\n\nSo overall, I'd classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because there's no evidence of malicious activity or unusual patterns when considering all events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system operations such as process loading and registry modifications. Events involve standard processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and svchost.exe performing typical tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
