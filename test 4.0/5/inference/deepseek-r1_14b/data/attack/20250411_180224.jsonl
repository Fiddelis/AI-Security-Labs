{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used both legitimately and maliciously, so this catches my attention. But it's just one event; I'll keep an eye on how it repeats.\n\nNext up is cmd.exe creating a scheduled task using schtasks with a command that runs powershell.exe with some arguments. The path mentioned doesn't exist, which is suspicious because non-existing scripts are often used to avoid detection. This seems like potential malicious activity.\n\nThen there's another powershell.exe process access event. Repeated PowerShell executions, especially with elevated privileges (as seen in the schtasks command), could be signs of lateral movement or persistence. I'm noting that this might indicate a sequence of malicious actions.\n\nAnother cmd.exe setting registry values follows. This seems part of the same chain, maybe configuring settings to maintain persistence or change system behavior. It's concerning because legitimate software doesn't usually do this kind of registry manipulation in bulk without reason.\n\nSchtasks.exe is creating another scheduled task with similar parameters as before, again referencing a non-existing script path. The repetition and use of schtasks for scheduling scripts that don't exist are red flags. This could be an attempt to create a persistent backdoor.\n\nAn image load event from schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll seems normal since it's part of the Task Scheduler. But combined with the previous events, it might still be suspicious if this happens outside of legitimate system operations.\n\nMultiple svchost.exe processes setting registry values are next. Svchost is a common process for services but can also be used by malware to hide activities. The fact that these are all Registry writes could indicate malicious configuration changes, like enabling startup items or modifying security policies.\n\nThen, an event where svchost.exe creates a file in the Windows Task folder. This seems unusual because svchost typically doesn't create files; it's more of a service host. If this is creating a new task file, it might be setting up a scheduled task that could execute malicious code later.\n\nAnother schtasks.exe query event for an existing task named win32times follows. This could indicate checking if the malicious task exists before attempting to create it again, which is a common tactic in persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe and conhost.exe setting registry values. Conhost is usually related to console windows; its use in registry modifications could be another attempt at making changes that should raise flags.\n\nA file creation event by winlogbeat.exe for a .yml.new file in the user's downloads folder stands out. Winlogbeat is an ELK stack tool, but if it's creating files in unusual locations or with specific names, it might be worth investigating to ensure no exfiltration or malicious logging is happening.\n\nFinally, there's a powershell.exe creating a file called estrutura_geral.txt. Without knowing the content, this could be benign or part of data gathering for an attack.\n\nLooking at all these events together, several patterns emerge: repeated use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks with non-existing scripts, multiple Registry modifications by various processes, and a suspicious file creation by winlogbeat.exe. These activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence or lateral movement within the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks with non-existing script paths, multiple Registry modifications by various processes (powershell.exe, svchost.exe), and suspicious file creation activities which may indicate potential malicious behavior or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first event shows `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in the data directory. That's standard since winlogbeat is responsible for collecting logs, so it makes sense it would create or update its configuration file.\n\nNext up, there are two events from `powershell.exe`. The first one indicates that a file named `entrada_ativo.txt` was created. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThe third event again involves `powershell.exe`, but this time it's accessing another process. This might mean that PowerShell is interacting with other running processes, which can sometimes be part of malicious scripts trying to elevate privileges or hide their activity.\n\nThen there's an event from `whoami.exe`. This tool is usually used to determine the user account under which the program is running. In most cases, it's benign, but if it's being executed in conjunction with other activities like those from PowerShell, it might be part of a larger sequence of actions that could be malicious.\n\nLooking at the last event again, `powershell.exe` accessing another processâ€”this repetition makes me think there's a script running multiple commands. PowerShell scripts often execute several commands in sequence, so this alone isn't necessarily suspicious unless the commands themselves are doing something harmful.\n\nPutting it all together: There's activity involving multiple processes and file creations, but nothing explicitly malicious stands out. However, the use of `powershell.exe` creating files and accessing other processes could be indicative of script execution, which might be a precursor to more malicious behavior. The fact that both `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe` are involved adds some level of concern, as these tools can be misused for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is an attack, but there's enough unusual activity to warrant closer examination. The confidence level isn't very high because while the actions could be malicious, they might also be part of normal system operations or user activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files and accessing processes, along with whoami.exe execution, may indicate potential script-based activity that could be malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
