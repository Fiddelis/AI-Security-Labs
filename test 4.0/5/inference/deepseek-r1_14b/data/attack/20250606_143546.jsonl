{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, multiple instances of powershell.exe are running with some commands. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. One event shows a command-line argument that includes importing a .ps1 script from \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\". The path seems suspiciously long and the filename has Portuguese words, which might be an indicator of a non-English speaking attacker or perhaps just obfuscation.\n\nLooking at the events, powershell.exe is creating files in the Temp directory. There's a file created with a random name __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1 and then immediately deleted. That behavior is common in malware to avoid detection by cleaning up traces quickly.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs when running PowerShell. This is normal but combined with the other activities, it might indicate that the script is loading malicious components or modules.\n\nThere's also a svchost.exe creating a log file and setting registry values, which could be part of legitimate system processes, but when paired with the powershell.exe events, it adds to the suspicion. svchost is commonly used by malware for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of PowerShell with suspicious scripts, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and activity from svchost—it seems like a potential malicious sequence. The confidence level is high because several red flags are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing potentially malicious scripts, including file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory and suspicious registry activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Most of them are from svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download folder with various .dll extensions. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, so those might just be normal updates or patches being installed.\n\nThere's also a PowerShell instance creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That could be suspicious because attackers often use PowerShell for execution. Plus, there are multiple Registry writes from different processes like HxTsr.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, which could indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, without more context about the specific activities or any signs of failed operations or anomalies, it's hard to conclude they're malicious. Maybe it's just Windows updating or legitimate system activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities such as file creations and registry modifications by known processes like svchost.exe, which is commonly used for legitimate purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are a bunch of JSON objects here, each representing an event. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events have the process name as 'svchost.exe'. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by services, so it's common and usually not suspicious on its own. But sometimes, malware can hide under this name, so I need to be cautious.\n\nLooking at the tasks performed: most are either \"Registry value set\" or \"File created\". Registry modifications can be normal for system services but also a red flag if they're making unauthorized changes. The files being created have various paths, some in Windows directories like SoftwareDistribution and ServiceProfiles.\n\nI see that many events are repetitive. There are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values without any associated file (file is None). This repetition could be part of legitimate system operations, but it's also a pattern attackers might use to avoid detection by spreading out their activities.\n\nThe few file creation events point to different locations. One creates an .etl file in Windows Logs, which I'm not too familiar with, but etl files are usually log traces, so maybe that's normal. There are entries in SoftwareDistribution and Download folders, which makes me think about Windows Update or system updates. However, the exact paths like 'C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\Logs' seem a bit specific and could be signs of something unusual, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe last event has no process name, just a file creation in Windows Logs. That seems less concerning on its own but might fit into a larger pattern.\n\nConsidering all events together: the repetition of svchost.exe doing registry writes and creating files doesn't immediately scream 'attack', but it's worth looking into because attackers often use legitimate processes for malicious activities. The exact paths created could be areas where they're trying to hide or persist between reboots.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because while each event might not be alarming, the combination of repeated registry changes and file creations across various system directories could indicate something malicious. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context, so my confidence is around 75%.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files in system directories may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common Windows process that can be legitimate or malicious, but in this case, it's just a registry change, which could be normal.\n\nNext, svchost.exe creates a file in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory, specifically \"Install\". That seems suspicious because that directory is usually for Windows updates. Creating files there without an update happening might indicate something fishy, like a potential exploit or implant.\n\nThen, it creates another file: AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. The naming suggests it's a patch or update file. But the fact that svchost is creating an executable here could be a red flag, as malicious actors might use this method to execute code.\n\nMoving on to MpSigStub.exe, which I recognize as related to Windows Defender. It's loading a DLL and creating several files in a temporary directory. The filenames look like update delta patches (mpasdlta.vdm, mpavdlta.vdm). This seems legitimate because Windows Defender often handles updates by creating such files.\n\nThere are multiple events where MpSigStub is creating these files, which aligns with how the system handles patching and updates. So these might not be suspicious on their own but could be related to the earlier svchost activity.\n\nSetup.exe is then seen creating several files in the EdgeCore directory. These include exe files like cookie_exporter.exe, elevated_tracing_service.exe, etc. Setup.exe is commonly used for installing software, and creating these files is normal during an installation or update process. Microsoft Edge updates might be happening here, which is a legitimate activity.\n\nThere's also an event where MsMpEng.exe loads a DLL, which again points to Windows Defender operations, so that's expected.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe making a registry change could be related to UAC or other system services. RuntimeBroker handles various background processes, and registry changes aren't unusual here.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe is accessed but without any file information. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, but access alone doesn't indicate malicious activity. However, if combined with previous events, it might raise suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together: the svchost.exe creating files in SoftwareDistribution and an executable patch file stands out. This could be part of a broader attack vector where malware is trying to persist or deploy updates without proper authorization. The other events are mostly legitimate processes handling updates and system services, but the combination with svchost's activity might indicate something more nefarious.\n\nI need to consider whether this is just normal background activity or if there's actual malicious behavior. The fact that svchost.exe is involved in creating files related to patches or updates could mean an attacker is using known processes for dropping or executing malicious payloads. This pattern could be part of a fileless malware technique or an attempt to elevate privileges.\n\nGiven the potential for these events to signal a security incident, especially focusing on the svchost and the temporary patch files created by it, I would flag this batch as potentially interesting for further investigation. The combination suggests possible unauthorized system modifications that need to be looked into more closely.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial Analysis of Processes:**\n   - Events involve processes like svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, setup.exe, and powershell.exe, which can have both legitimate and malicious uses.\n\n2. **svchost.exe Activities:**\n   - Creates registry values and files in the SoftwareDistribution directory.\n   - The file \"AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe\" is suspicious as it resembles a patch or update, possibly indicating unauthorized activity.\n\n3. **MpSigStub.exe Actions:**\n   - Handles Windows Defender updates by creating delta patches in temporary directories. These actions are legitimate and part of normal system operations.\n\n4. **setup.exe Operations:**\n   - Installs Microsoft Edge-related files, which is expected during software updates or installations.\n\n5. **RuntimeBroker.exe and MsMpEng.exe:**\n   - Their activities are typical for system services and don't raise alarms on their own.\n\n6. **powershell.exe Access:**\n   - Alone, it's not suspicious, but in combination with other events, could indicate potential misuse.\n\n7. **Identifying Red Flags:**\n   - The svchost.exe creating files in SoftwareDistribution and an executable patch file is concerning. This could signal unauthorized access or malware attempting persistence.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - While many events are legitimate, the suspicious activities involving svchost.exe warrant further investigation to ensure no malicious activity is occurring under the guise of system updates.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch contains potentially suspicious activity involving svchost.exe creating files in a directory typically used for Windows updates and generating an executable patch file. This could indicate unauthorized system modifications or malware attempting to persist. Therefore, this batch is **interesting for investigation** due to these red flags.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"svchost_activity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Created files in the SoftwareDistribution directory and an executable patch file.\",\n      \"suspicion_level\": \"high\",\n      \"details\": [\n        \"File creation path: C:\\\\Windows\\\\SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download\\\\Install\",\n        \"Executable created: AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"powershell_access\": {\n      \"description\": \"Accessed powershell.exe, which is often used for malicious activities when combined with other events.\",\n      \"suspicion_level\": \"medium\",\n      \"details\": [\n        \"Process accessed without file information.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event from the system logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to 'powershell.exe'. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Let me look closer.\n\nThe first event shows whoami.exe being executed normally, just to check user info, probably not an issue on its own. Then, powershell.exe starts appearing with different events. It accesses the process, which is normal, but then there's a registry value set and eventually a file creation and deletion of a script in the temp folder.\n\nWait, creating and then deleting a file quickly might be to avoid detection. The script name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1; that seems suspicious. Maybe it's trying to execute some code without leaving evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry writes by services.exe as well. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities like creating persistent backdoors or altering system configurations to allow unauthorized access.\n\nThe repeated ImageLoad events for various DLLs in powershell suggest that it might be loading modules or executing scripts that require those libraries. The use of .NET framework components isn't unusual, but combined with the other actions, it raises concern.\n\nAlso, the Pipe Created event could indicate communication between different processes, which might be part of a larger malicious activity chain.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern here: suspicious file operations in Temp, multiple registry writes, and powershell activities that don't seem necessary. This combination is often indicative of malicious behavior trying to establish persistence or execute commands without being detected.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activity including file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, multiple registry modifications, and evidence of script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first four entries all involve 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various .NET framework files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate components of the .NET runtime, so their being loaded isn't unusual. It's common for applications to load these when running .NET code.\n\nNext, there are events where 'powershell.exe' creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. While PowerShell is often used maliciously, creating a profile data file might be part of legitimate initialization processes, especially in non-interactive environments like scripts or background tasks.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe sets a registry value. This could be normal if it's part of configuration settings during script execution, but it's something to note because registry modifications can sometimes indicate malicious activity, though not always.\n\nA few events have 'None' for process and file, which might be errors or incomplete log entries. They don't add much to the analysis.\n\nThe later entries are more concerning. Multiple events show powershell.exe executing a command that imports a PowerShell script from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The command tries to invoke 'Invoke-entrada_principal' and includes error handling with exit codes based on exceptions caught.\n\nThe fact that the same command is repeated multiple times suggests it's part of a loop or persistent execution. Additionally, the script is being imported from a network path or shared directory (\"C:\\\\unidade_logico...\"), which could be a red flag because scripts fetched over the network can be malicious payloads.\n\nAnother point is the use of Invoke-entrada_principal, which isn't a standard PowerShell cmdlet. Custom functions like this might be obfuscated or part of a custom framework used for malicious purposes.\n\nAlso, the script includes a sleep command (Start-Sleep 5), which could be used to delay execution, possibly to avoid detection or to time the attack during off-hours when system activity is lower.\n\nConsidering all these events together: repeated PowerShell executions importing and running a script from an unusual path with custom commands and error handling raises suspicions. The combination of loading .NET components (possibly for obfuscation or payload delivery) and executing potentially malicious scripts makes this batch of logs worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing a script from an unusual path, with repeated calls to Invoke-entrada_principal and custom error handling suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, first, I'll go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's a PowerShell command that imports a module from a specific path and tries to run an Invoke-entrada_principal function. If there's an error, it catches it and exits with the exception code. Then it sleeps for 5 seconds. That seems a bit suspicious because using powershell.exe is common in attacks.\n\nNext, I see multiple events where PowerShell is being used again, but this time they're trying to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" and start it. The path mentioned is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. Creating services with PowerShell could be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nThen there are several events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file involved is component_auxiliar.ps1 located in another directory. This script might be executing remotely, which is another red flag because remote execution can indicate malicious activity.\n\nI also notice that these events repeat multiple times—like the service creation command appears seven times, and the remote command execution appears eight times. Repetition like this could suggest automated or batched activities, possibly from an attacker trying to establish persistence or spread across systems.\n\nPutting it all together: The use of PowerShell for creating services and executing scripts, especially with hardcoded paths and repeated attempts, indicates potential malicious behavior. The import of a module from a specific path and the attempt to run a script could be indicators of an attack. It seems like this batch is showing signs of a possible compromise or an ongoing attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events creating services and executing remote commands suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is the recurring pattern where multiple events show \"Execute a Remote Command\" with the same file path: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This repetition makes me think there's potentially malicious activity, especially since PowerShell scripts are often used for attacks.\n\nHowever, I also notice some other events like logon tasks from services.exe and a few special logons. These could be normal system processes or legitimate user activities. The fact that the majority of the events are about remote command execution with the same file suggests a possible script being run repeatedly, which is suspicious.\n\nI need to consider whether this pattern indicates an ongoing malicious process. The repeated execution of the same PowerShell script might be part of an automated attack or a lateral movement within a network. It's also possible that the script is attempting persistence by running on startup or through other means.\n\nOn the flip side, sometimes legitimate scripts run multiple times, especially during updates or scans. But given the high frequency and identical file path, it leans more towards malicious intent. The combination of these events could indicate a potential security incident worth investigating.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there are some normal logon activities, the dominant pattern points to something that might be interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'Execute a Remote Command' events targeting the same file path suggest potential malicious activity or automated process worth investigating.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

This specific file path repeats multiple times. \n\nI recall that powershell scripts can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that the same script path is involved in several remote command executions might indicate something suspicious, especially if it's executed repeatedly.\n\nThere are a couple of other events where winlog task changes to 'Windows Update Agent' and file becomes None. These might just be normal Windows update checks or related processes, which don't raise immediate red flags on their own.\n\nHowever, the high number of repeated remote command executions with the same script is concerning. It could indicate an attempt to run a malicious script multiple times, possibly trying different approaches or evading detection. Such repetitive behavior isn't typical in normal system operations and could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I believe this batch of logs warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events show execution of the same remote command pointing to a specific PowerShell script path, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
