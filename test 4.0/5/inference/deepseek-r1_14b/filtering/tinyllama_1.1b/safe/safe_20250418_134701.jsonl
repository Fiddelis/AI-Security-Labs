The task in the winlog is \"File created\" each time, so these are all file creation events.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all inside a node_modules folder under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp.

Each one is a JSON object on its own line, and they all seem to be from the same user or system. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that every event has the same process name: \"git.exe\". That tells me this activity is related to Git, which is commonly used for version control systems like GitHub. So, whatever is happening here involves Git operations.\n\nLooking at each JSON object, there's a 'winlog' field with the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that a file was created on the system. The file paths all point to different .d.ts files inside a node_modules folder for Cypress and lodash. These are TypeScript declaration files, which usually contain type definitions used by TypeScript projects.\n\nThe file paths are pretty consistent across all events. They're all under \"node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/\". Each event creates a new file with names like kebabCase.d.ts, keyBy.d.ts, etc. Since these are part of the node_modules directory, it's likely that during a development process, especially when using tools like npm or yarn, new files might be created or updated as dependencies are installed or updated.\n\nI also note that all events have the same structure and origin. There's no variation in the processes or the types of files being created. It seems repetitive but within the same scope. The creation of these specific files suggests that perhaps a package update or installation is taking place, which would cause multiple file creations in the node_modules directory.\n\nSince all these events are from Git.exe and involve creating files in a standard development environment, it doesn't raise any immediate red flags. They look like normal operations someone might perform when working on a project that uses Git for version control and npm for managing dependencies.\n\nI also think about whether there's any possibility of malicious activity here. Typically, malicious actors wouldn't create so many specific .d.ts files in such a structured manner. Instead, they might delete logs, create hidden files, or access sensitive areas outside the node_modules directory. These activities don't show signs of being suspicious; they fit more with standard development workflows.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether these events are part of an automated process, like a CI\/CD pipeline or script that's updating dependencies and checking out code. If this happened during such a process, it would be normal to see multiple file creations at once.\n\nIn conclusion, while the number of events might seem high, they all point to legitimate Git operations within a development environment, specifically in a project using Node.js and npm. There's no evidence of unusual behavior or signs of an attack.
