{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me start by going through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\nFirst event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal since it's part of the logging process. No red flags here.\n\nNext up, cmd.exe running some commands with certutil. Certutil can be used for various purposes, including encoding and decoding files. The command line has \"certutil -encode calc.exe\" which catches my eye because using certutil to encode executable files might be a way to obfuscate malicious code. That's something to note.\n\nThen there are multiple events where cmd.exe and certutil.exe set registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, so that's suspicious. Malware often creates or modifies registry keys to ensure it runs on startup.\n\nLooking further, another cmd.exe command decodes an encoded file into a new executable. This could indicate the creation of malicious binaries from previously obfuscated files. Definitely something to look into.\n\nThere are rundll32.exe calls to PcaSvc.dll, which I'm not immediately familiar with. However, unusual usage of rundll32 can sometimes be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's trying to execute non-standard functions.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing processes and registry is also concerning. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The events show process access, which might mean it's gathering information or trying to manipulate other processes.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using certutil to encode\/decode files, multiple registry modifications, rundll32 executions, and powershell activity suggests potential malicious behavior. These are common techniques used in cyberattacks for persistence, privilege escalation, and payload execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activities including the use of certutil.exe to encode\/decode files, multiple registry modifications, and powershell process accesses, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
