The logs are in JSONL format, each line has a JSON object with process info, windows log task, and file details.\n\nFirst event: Process name is powershell.exe accessing something. Not sure what that means yet.\n\nSecond event: Also powershell.exe but the command line looks suspicious. It has some findstr and select-string commands looking for patterns like 'password' in various file types. That sounds a lot like password harvesting, which could be malicious activity.\n\nThird to fifth events: Powershell loading different DLLs. This is normal for scripts, especially if they're doing something with .NET or other frameworks. Not immediately suspicious unless there's more context.\n\nSixth event: File created by powershell.exe in the temp directory. The filename has 'PSScriptPolicyTest' which I'm not sure about. Could be part of script execution, but combined with previous events, it might indicate something malicious.\n\nSeventh and eighth events: Processes again with the same suspicious command line as before, looking for passwords. This repetition is concerning because attackers often run scripts multiple times.\n\nNinth event: svchost.exe making a registry change. Svchost can be legitimate or part of malware, but the task is just setting a registry value which isn't enough on its own.\n\nTenth event: OfficeClickToRun.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal if it's checking for updates or something, so probably nothing to worry here.\n\nEleventh event: Powershell again with the same command line. Definitely seeing a pattern that could indicate malicious activity.\n\nTwelfth and thirteenth events: More registry sets by powershell and other processes like ApplicationFrameHost and Calculator. These might be normal, but when combined with previous suspicious activities, it's another red flag.\n\nFourteenth to seventeenth events: Chrome doing various things. The pipe created could be for inter-process communication, which is standard. Registry writes are also common for app settings. So nothing too worrying here unless there's more context about what exactly is being set.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with commands searching for 'password' in files and creating temp files suggests possible malicious intent, like credential harvesting or persistence mechanisms. The multiple events from powershell are especially concerning, as attackers often use such tools to hide their activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated suspicious PowerShell activity with commands that search for sensitive patterns and create temporary files, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few logs, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe doing DNS queries and loading system files. That seems normal because Chrome often accesses various resources. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file; that's likely the log agent itself writing logs, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe creating files in the Downloads folder. The filenames are \"objeto_logico.txt\" and \"estrutura_ativo.txt\". Those names don't immediately raise red flags, but it's worth noting since PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nThere are several NetworkConnect events from chrome.exe. If there were an unusual number or destination IPs, that might be concerning, but without specific details on the destinations, this could just be regular browsing.\n\nThen I spot some cmd.exe processes deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command lines show deleting specific task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". This is interesting because deleting system tasks can be a sign of malicious activity, possibly trying to remove competition or cover tracks.\n\nContinuing on, there's another schtasks.exe creating processes which might be related to the deletion. Then WMIC.exe is used to delete notepad.exe processes and load DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. This could indicate an attempt to disable anti-malware measures since amsi is related to antivirus scanning.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple high-privilege processes (cmd, schtasks, WMIC) are being used to delete system tasks and possibly disable security features. These actions can be indicative of an attacker trying to clean up after themselves or install persistence mechanisms without detection. While some events could be benign, the combination points towards potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including deletion of system tasks and use of WMIC for potentially malicious operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and powershell.exe. The winlog tasks are things like Registry value set, Process Create, and others. Hmm, registry activity could be a red flag because attackers often modify system settings to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThere are multiple instances where the same processes are being usedâ€”like cmd.exe being called several times with different command lines. One of them deletes files in the Temp directory, which might indicate an attempt to clean up traces of previous activities. That's concerning because malicious actors often delete logs or files to cover their tracks.\n\nPowershell.exe is appearing multiple times too. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and executing malicious commands. The fact that it's being accessed several times without clear context could be suspicious, especially if the command lines aren't obviously benign.\n\nAlso, there are events where processes are accessing or modifying files. For example, cmd.exe deleting a specific file in the Temp directory. This deletion might be part of an attack chain to remove evidence of malicious activities. The path mentioned, \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\", suggests that this is a temporary file being removed after some operation.\n\nAnother point to note is the repeated Registry value sets. Attackers often use registry modifications to ensure their malicious activities persist across reboots or to hide themselves within the system. Multiple such events without corresponding legitimate reasons could be indicators of compromise.\n\nAdditionally, there are instances where processes like conhost.exe and whoami.exe are being used. These might seem innocent at first glance, but in certain contexts, they can be part of privilege escalation techniques or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe last few lines mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks with powershell.exe, which could be related to module loading or execution. This is another area where attackers might use legitimate tools for malicious purposes, such as downloading and executing scripts or other payloads.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple process creations, file deletions, registry modifications, and powershell accesses. These activities collectively raise red flags. While some of these actions could be part of normal system operations, the frequency and combination suggest potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to modify system settings and delete temporary files without clear justification make this batch particularly concerning.\n\nI'm confident enough that these events are indicative of an attack or at least suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations, registry modifications, and file deletions by potentially malicious processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed with different command lines. Some have 'powershell.exe & {}' which seems odd because it's just a placeholder. Then, there are tasks related to process creation, image loading, and registry events for powershell.exe. That makes me think someone might be running PowerShell scripts or commands, but the specifics aren't clear yet.\n\nI notice that several entries mention 'Registry value set'. Registry modifications can be malicious, especially if done by a script. But in this case, without knowing what exactly is being changed, it's hard to say for sure. It could just be normal script execution, like setting some configuration.\n\nThere are also events where whoami.exe is executed multiple times. Whoami is typically used to check user privileges and might indicate reconnaissance activity. If an attacker runs it multiple times, they're probably trying to understand the environment or test permissions.\n\nAnother point of interest is RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe accessing the registry. RuntimeBroker is usually related to Windows services and UWP apps, but seeing it in logs with registry access isn't common. Notepad.exe being used for such operations seems suspicious because it's a simple text editor and shouldn't be making many registry changes.\n\nPutting this together, I see several activities that could be part of an attack chain: powershell.exe executions, whoami.exe runs, and unexpected registry accesses by other processes. These actions might indicate initial access, privilege escalation, or lateral movement. However, without more context like timestamps, user information, or the exact commands run in PowerShell, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nOn the other hand, these could also be legitimate scripts or tools running during system administration tasks. The repeated use of whoami.exe might be part of a script checking permissions across multiple systems.\n\nGiven that there are multiple potentially suspicious activities but no clear indicators of compromise, my confidence is moderate. I think it's worth investigating to rule out any malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe executions with potential command line anomalies, repeated whoami.exe runs, and registry modifications by various processes suggest possible reconnaissance or malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I've got a batch of system log events in JSONL format, each with some information about processes, windows logs, and files. My task is to analyze all these events together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each event to understand what's happening:\n\n1. Calculator.exe loaded urlmon.dll.\n2. svchost.exe set a registry value.\n3. winlogbeat.exe created a new config file.\n4. powershell.exe was accessed.\n5. chrome.exe made multiple DNS queries and established network connections.\n\nNow, I'll analyze each event individually to see if any of them stand out as suspicious or normal behavior.\n\n1. **Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll**: Calculator is a common system app, and it's known to load various DLLs for functionality. Urlmon.dll handles URL protocol processing, which makes sense in this context. Nothing seems off here.\n\n2. **svchost.exe setting a registry value**: SvcHost.exe runs services, and modifying the registry is normal for services. Unless thereâ€™s an unusual service name or known malicious activity, this doesnâ€™t raise flags.\n\n3. **winlogbeat.exe creating a file**: Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) used for log management. Creating config files during setup is normal and expected behavior.\n\n4. **powershell.exe being accessed**: PowerShell can be both a legitimate tool and abused by attackers. However, without specific indicators like unusual command-line arguments or known malicious scripts, this could just be a user running scripts or system admins performing tasks.\n\n5. **Multiple chrome.exe events**: The repeated DNS queries and network connections are consistent with normal browsing activity. Chrome regularly makes DNS requests to resolve domains and establishes connections for data transfer.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: Calculator loading a DLL, svchost modifying the registry, winlogbeat setting up its config, powershell accessed, and chrome doing typical browser activities. \n\nI should check if any of these events are anomalies when combined. For example, unusual combinations might include multiple high-privilege processes making changes or unexpected file accesses. But here, each event is within normal operational behavior for the respective processes.\n\nAnother angle is to look for timestampsâ€”if all these events happened in quick succession without a clear reason, that could be suspicious. However, since the logs are presented without timestamps, it's hard to assess timing.\n\nI also need to think about whether any of these actions are known attack vectors. For instance, svchost.exe can be used by malware, but again, without more context on what specific service is running or changes made in the registry, itâ€™s not conclusive.\n\nPowershell is a red flag for many due to its versatility in scripting and potential misuse, but as mentioned earlier, without evidence of malicious commands, it's hard to classify this event as suspicious.\n\nLooking at file paths: Calculator.exe accessing urlmon.dll from System32 is standard. Winlogbeat creating a config file in the user directory is also normal for configuration purposes.\n\nThe multiple chrome.exe events might indicate heavy browsing or downloads, but again, within normal user activity unless there's an unusual volume or specific domains accessed.\n\nPutting it all together, each event on its own isn't concerning, and collectively, they don't present a pattern that suggests malicious behavior. There's no evidence of failed login attempts, unauthorized access signs, file deletions, or other red flags typically seen in cybersecurity incidents.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities described are within normal operational parameters for typical user and system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system operations such as process execution, registry modifications, file creation, and network activity from common applications like Calculator.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, PowerShell.exe, and chrome.exe. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or anomalies in the provided logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
