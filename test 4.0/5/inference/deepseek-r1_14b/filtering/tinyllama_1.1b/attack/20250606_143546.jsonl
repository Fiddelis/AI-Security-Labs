{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. I'm seeing a series of JSONL entries, each containing process information, Windows log tasks, and file details. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that powershell.exe is being accessed multiple times with different file operations. This immediately raises my suspicion because PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious. The activities include creating files in temporary directories and loading various DLLs, which could be signs of script execution or module loading—common behaviors for both authorized scripts and potential threats.\n\nAnother point that catches my eye is the use of svchost.exe. I know that svchost is a common process name used by system services, but it's also frequently abused by malware to hide their activities. The events show svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory, which can be related to Windows Update processes, but sometimes attackers misuse this for persistence or dropping malicious payloads.\n\nThere are multiple instances where both powershell.exe and svchost.exe are interacting with system files and registry entries. This combination of process activity across different components is concerning. Malicious actors often use a blend of tools and techniques to evade detection, so seeing these together might indicate a more complex attack vector.\n\nThe events also involve file creation and image loading tasks. While these activities aren't inherently malicious on their own, the frequency and specific paths involved (like temporary directories and system32) suggest potential unauthorized access or execution. For example, creating a PowerShell script in a temporary folder could be part of a persistence mechanism or dropping a backdoor.\n\nMoreover, the repeated registry value sets by svchost.exe are worth monitoring. Registry modifications can be part of establishing persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations to allow further attacks. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the pattern here seems non-standard for normal system operations.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event might not be alarming, the cumulative effect raises red flags. The combination of PowerShell usage, svchost.exe activities, file creations in sensitive directories, and registry modifications points towards potential malicious behavior. This batch definitely warrants a closer look to assess the true nature of these events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system files and creating temporary scripts, along with svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files in SoftwareDistribution, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are all from svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That seems normal because svchost is a legitimate Windows process used by various services, including Windows Update. The paths like DataStore and Download are typical for update-related activities.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the Cache folder under NetworkService's AppData. Again, that's part of how updates are handled, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext up is an event without a process, but it's creating a log file in WindowsUpdate logs. That's standard for system updates and tracking.\n\nMoving on, I see multiple events where svchost.exe sets registry values. This could be normal if the system is configuring services or settings during updates.\n\nThen, there are events from MpSigStub.exe loading Defender components. That makes sense as part of antivirus operations, so nothing wrong here.\n\nThe next set involves setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft Edge directory. It looks like it's setting up some tools for Edge, which is normal during installations or updates.\n\nNow, things get a bit interesting. There are powershell.exe events: one where it's accessed, another where it sets a registry value, and a Process Create event with a command line argument. The command line shows a script trying to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe.\n\nWait, that path looks suspicious. It's using Portuguese directory names like \"Entrada Base,\" which might be unusual unless the system is configured that way. Also, creating a new service via PowerShell could indicate legitimate administration or possible malicious activity.\n\nLooking deeper, the command line includes \"& {New-Service...\" which suggests someone is trying to create a new service on the system. If this isn't authorized, it could be a sign of malware installing persistent mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe loads .NET libraries, which is normal when running scripts that require those frameworks. But combined with the creation of a new service, it raises flags.\n\nI should also consider the context: if these events happened during an update or legitimate maintenance, they might be part of a script run by Microsoft services. However, without additional context, the creation of a service pointing to an external path is concerning.\n\nThe other events don't show any overtly malicious behavior, but the powershell.exe activity stands out. Since one event shows command-line arguments that suggest creating a new service with potentially unknown or external binaries, it's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious PowerShell activity involving the creation of a new service and loading .NET libraries, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is the process involved. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a red flag for malicious activities. The tasks include Image loaded and File created\/Delete. For example, one event shows a file being created in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1\". Temporary script files are suspicious because attackers might use them to execute malicious code temporarily.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where powershell.exe is executing scripts from specific paths. The command lines show import-module and trying to invoke functions from a script located at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script is being imported multiple times, which might indicate repeated attempts or part of a loop.\n\nOne event stands out where powershell.exe tries to create a new service using New-Service with the name \"objeto_ativo\" and sets its binary path to another executable: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating a new service is concerning because it can allow persistence; the attacker might be trying to create a persistent backdoor.\n\nAdditionally, other processes like services.exe and tarefa_logico.exe are involved. The latter is loading several .NET framework DLLs, which isn't inherently malicious but could mask malicious activities if these components are being abused.\n\nAnother point is that some entries have None for file or process, which might indicate incomplete logging or attempts to obscure the source of certain actions.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe executing scripts from non-standard locations, creating a new service, and repeated import-module calls suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of these events increases the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances showing suspicious activities including script imports, file operations in Temp directory, and attempts to create a new service which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, each line a separate event. The key fields here are 'process', 'winlog', and 'file'. \n\nStarting with the first two entries, I see that the process is running powershell.exe with some command-line arguments. The command creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Then it starts that service. This looks suspicious because creating services via PowerShell can be a common tactic for persistence or malicious activities.\n\nNext, looking at the other events, there are multiple entries where 'winlog' shows 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file path is \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". This script is being executed remotely several times. The repetition of the same command and file path raises red flags; attackers often use such scripts to maintain persistence or carry out malicious tasks.\n\nAdditionally, there are some log entries from services.exe with 'Logon' task, which might be legitimate system activities, but combined with the other events, they don't negate the suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these together: creating a new service via PowerShell and multiple remote command executions of the same script suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of the same file path in remote commands could indicate an attempt to execute a payload or establish persistence.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or source IPs, it's hard to be certain if these are part of normal operations or truly malicious. But given the combination of creating a service and multiple remote script executions, the batch as a whole is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell creating a new service and executing a remote command from the same file path, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at three JSONL events here. Each one has a \"winlog\" task of \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and the file path is the same in all cases: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1.\" \n\nSo, first off, the fact that all events are identical makes me think there's some automation or script involved. The file path seems to point to a PowerShell script, which is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. That raises a red flag because attackers often use scripts like these for remote execution.\n\nI'm noticing the same command being executed multiple times. Could this be part of a larger campaign? Maybe it's attempting to establish persistence or spread across systems. Repeating the same command could indicate an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms, which is another sign that something might not be right.\n\nThe file path has Portuguese words like \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_secundario,\" which translates to \"Logical Unit\" and \"Secondary Record.\" That's unusual in a typical English-speaking environment. It makes me wonder if this script is part of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) targeting a specific region or language group.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's trying to execute a remote command multiple times on the same file might be an attempt to ensure the command runs successfully, possibly indicating a DDoS-like behavior where resources are drained or commands are repeatedly issued to servers.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated execution of a PowerShell script with a suspicious path and potential geographic targeting—it seems like this batch could indicate malicious activity. I'm not 100% certain without more context, but the patterns here are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events of executing a remote command on the same file path suggest potential malicious activity or automation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
