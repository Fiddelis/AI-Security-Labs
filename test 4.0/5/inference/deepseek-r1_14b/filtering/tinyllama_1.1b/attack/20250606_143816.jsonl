{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key usually contains details about the executable that was run, like its name and sometimes the command line arguments. Winlog gives the type of event logged by Windows, such as 'Process accessed' or 'Image loaded'. The file key points to any file associated with that event, like a DLL being loaded or a file being created.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see entries where powershell.exe is accessing processes and loading images. For example, there are multiple instances of ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs, which isn't unusual since PowerShell often loads these to function properly. However, one thing that stands out is the event where powershell.exe deletes a file: FileDeleteDetected on 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1'. This caught my attention because deleting files can be part of malicious activities to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nAnother event I noticed is the creation of a new PowerShell profile: FileCreate for 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. While creating profiles isn't inherently suspicious, it's something that could be monitored for unusual activities if done repeatedly or with elevated privileges.\n\nThere are also some events from sppsvc.exe accessing taskschd.dll and creating cache files. I know sppsvc is related to the Software Protection Service, so its activity might not be concerning on its own unless there are signs of tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nWhat really piques my interest is the last event where powershell.exe was created with a specific command line: '\"powershell.exe\" & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}'. This command seems to be trying to create a new PowerShell drive mapped to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\", which could indicate an attempt to access another machine. This is concerning because it might suggest lateral movement in a network, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\nPutting all this together, the combination of file deletions, profile creation, and network mapping via PowerShell commands suggests potential malicious activity. While some actions like loading DLLs are normal, others like deleting files and attempting to access remote drives could be signs of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events related to PowerShell executing potentially suspicious commands, including file deletions and attempts to access remote resources, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line represents an event with process info, winlog data, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first event involves powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit unusual because scripts running on startup without user interaction could be malicious. But I'm not sure yet, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThen there are several events where the process is None and winlog task is None or Execute a Remote Command. Those don't tell me much on their own, but they might indicate something's off.\n\nThe majority of the events, though, show powershell.exe executing commands with some pretty long command lines. Looking closer, those commands download a script from a GitHub repo and then execute it using iex(), which is how you run PowerShell scripts. The script in question is from 'WinPwn.ps1' by S3cur3Th1sSh1t. I remember hearing that this specific script is known to be malicious; it's used for persistence and can do things like download additional payloads, escalate privileges, and avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are events where powershell.exe is creating a new PS drive with 'New-PSDrive' pointing to '\\\\Target\\\\C$'. That looks suspicious because it suggests attempting to access another system or a share, which could be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThe fact that the same command appears multiple times makes me think this isn't just one-off activity. It seems like someone is trying to establish persistence by running malicious scripts repeatedly. The combination of downloading a known bad script and attempting network drives strengthens the suspicion of ongoing malicious activity.\n\nEven though there are some events with None values, the repeated malicious-looking PowerShell commands stand out enough that I'd say this batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing a known malicious script (WinPwn.ps1) and attempting to create remote drives, indicating potential adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
