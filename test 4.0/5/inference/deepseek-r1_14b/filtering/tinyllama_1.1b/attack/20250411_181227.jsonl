{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, there are several events where powershell.exe is being executed with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. Each command seems to be registering a new task using Register-ScheduledTask, which triggers at login and runs calc.exe under the Administrators group with highest privileges. This looks suspicious because creating multiple scheduled tasks can be a common tactic in malware or persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various image files. These could be normal operations for PowerShell as it uses .NET components, but combined with the previous activity, they add to the concern. The file creation event for a temporary PS script '__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1' stands out because it's a PowerShell script being created in the user's AppData folder, which could be part of testing execution policies or deploying malicious scripts.\n\nI also notice that while some events have file paths and process details, others don't. This partial information makes it harder to trace but doesn't change the overall suspicion. The repetition of creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action is concerning because it suggests an attempt to create persistence points or execute malicious code at login.\n\nTaking all these together—the creation of multiple admin-level scheduled tasks, loading of .NET components (which could be for obfuscation or execution), and the temporary script file—it's clear that there's potentially malicious activity. The user in question might have executed a script intended to create persistence mechanisms on their system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and the creation of a temporary PowerShell script suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe is deleting a file. That's concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The file path ends with .ps1, which is a PowerShell script, so it might indicate some scripting activity.\n\nNext, there are two events where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. Looking at the commands, they're creating scheduled tasks that run calc.exe at logon with highest privileges. This seems suspicious because using such high privileges for a simple calculator execution could be an attempt to create persistence or escalate privileges in a malicious attack.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values and loading DLLs like amsi.dll, which is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface. While that's legitimate, the repeated registry writes might be trying to hide something or alter system configurations, which could be part of a broader attack.\n\nI also notice several entries where \"Execute a Remote Command\" is logged but no associated process name. This might indicate remote execution attempts, possibly through techniques like remote file injection or command-line attacks, which are common in APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats).\n\nLooking at other processes like WmiPrvSE.exe and svchost.exe loading system DLLs isn't unusual on its own, but combined with the other events, it adds to the concern. The use of powershell.exe multiple times for creating scheduled tasks and file operations is a red flag.\n\nThe last few events show file creations by powershell.exe and chrome.exe, which might be related to storing malicious scripts or objects that could execute later. This again ties into potential persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a pattern of using legitimate tools (like PowerShell) for malicious activities, such as creating persistent tasks with high privileges, modifying system configurations via the registry, and potentially writing files to disk. These activities don't necessarily prove an attack but strongly suggest suspicious behavior that could indicate a breach or an ongoing threat.\n\nI'm confident at around 0.85 that this batch is relevant for further investigation because the combination of multiple indicators points towards potential malicious intent rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell script deletions, creation of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, repeated registry modifications by Chrome.exe, and remote command executions. These indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
