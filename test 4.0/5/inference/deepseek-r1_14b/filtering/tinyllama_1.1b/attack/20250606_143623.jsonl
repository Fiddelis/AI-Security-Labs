Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from powershell.exe and other system processes like services.exe and svchost.exe. The tasks involved are things like image loading, registry value sets, pipe creation, and file creation.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: powershell.exe is setting a registry value and then loading several DLL files. This isn't unusual because PowerShell often loads various components when it runs scripts or commands. But I should keep an eye on whether these are legitimate modules or something malicious.\n\nNext, there's a process named tarefa_logico.exe which also loads some .NET framework DLLs. The name sounds like it might be related to \"lógica\" in Portuguese, meaning logic, perhaps a custom application. It's loading clr.dll and other standard .NET files, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the events from services.exe and svchost.exe, they're both setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, often used by various Windows services. Multiple registry writes could be normal if a service is initializing or configuring itself, but repeated writes without clear reason might warrant investigation.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory under the user's AppData. This could be part of regular PowerShell profile initialization, especially for non-interactive sessions. However, if this file is created unexpectedly or contains malicious content, it could be suspicious. Since I don't have the content of that file here, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother event shows a new file being created in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. This seems normal as system updates generate log files during their processes.\n\nConsidering all events together: there are multiple instances of registry writes by svchost.exe and services.exe. While these could be part of legitimate system operations, an unusually high number might indicate something is wrong, like a service trying to modify the registry repeatedly without cause.\n\nAdditionally, the creation of files in user directories by powershell.exe could be part of normal operation but should be monitored if it's not expected behavior in this context. The repeated image loads and registry modifications by these processes don't immediately signal malicious activity, but they might be signs of a potential issue or infection that requires further investigation.\n\nOverall, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity, but there are enough indicators to make me cautious. I'd say it's on the edge—interesting enough to look into more deeply to ensure nothing is amiss.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and services.exe, which could indicate potential system compromise.

All the entries are in JSONL format, each with a process, winlog task, and file info.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of setup.exe creating files related to Microsoft Edge. Paths like msedge.exe, msedge_proxy.exe, etc., which seem normal for an installer or update process.\n\nThen, svchost.exe is making several registry changes. Since svchost is a common system process, these might just be legitimate updates or configurations. No red flags there yet.\n\nOther processes like services.exe and setup.exe also set registry values. Again, this could be part of normal operations, especially if Edge is being installed or updated.\n\nThere's one event where setup.exe creates a pipe, which is often used for interprocess communication. Not inherently suspicious, but something to note.\n\nLastly, there's a shortcut file created in the user profile directory pointing to Microsoft Edge. This seems like standard behavior for applications setting up start menu shortcuts.\n\nOverall, all these events look like they're part of installing or updating software, particularly Microsoft Edge.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event and try to spot any patterns or anomalies.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they involve 'setup.exe' creating pipes and setting registry values. Setup.exe is typically used during software installations, so these could be normal if a new application is being installed. However, repeated pipe creations might indicate some form of communication between processes, which can sometimes be malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from 'svchost.exe' creating files in various temporary directories and the Windows AppReadiness folder. Svchost.exe is a common system process, often used by services. The paths here seem legitimate for temporary files and service-related tasks. But I should consider whether the frequency or specific file names raise any red flags.\n\nThen there are events from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' setting registry values. Runtime Broker handles user runtime permissions in Windows, so these activities might be normal unless they're unusual in volume or context.\n\nThe later entries involve 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers for command execution and script running. The events show it loading various DLLs and creating temporary files, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1. While some of these actions are normal, the creation of such a specific temp file could be suspicious. Also, multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe might indicate script execution or module loading.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows legitimate processes doing their usual tasks—setup.exe installing something, svchost handling services, RuntimeBroker managing permissions, and powershell running scripts. However, the combination of setup.exe creating pipes (which could be for communication) and powershell creating specific temp files raises an eyebrow. Malware often creates hidden processes or uses legitimate tools like powershell for hiding activities.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this indicates malicious activity, but there are enough elements that could point to something being off. The confidence level isn't very high since each individual event seems benign on its own, but the totality might suggest a potential issue.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from 'powershell.exe' loading various DLLs and creating temp files, which could indicate script execution. Additionally, repeated pipe creations by 'setup.exe' and registry modifications may suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events are about powershell.exe. The initial one shows that PowerShell accessed something with the task ProcessAccess. Then there's a FileCreate event where it created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. That seems a bit odd because I'm not sure why PowerShell would create a file there. Next, there's a command line that caught my attention: it's using Get-Item to look for *.inf files and checking if they match a certain pattern. This could be part of legitimate script execution, but the use of -ExecutionPolicy Restricted might indicate some form of scripting that's being controlled.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. That's normal when PowerShell runs scripts, especially with .NET components. But it's worth noting that these aren't malicious per se unless they're part of a larger suspicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the Windows Temp directory with a specific name __PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1. The .psm1 extension suggests it's a PowerShell module, which could be part of testing script policies but might also be a way to execute code.\n\nLooking further down, there are process creations for cmd.exe and Dism.exe with specific command lines. The cmd.exe is using Dism to disable the Windows Defender feature. That seems unusual because disabling antivirus\/antimalware can be an indicator of malicious activity aiming to lower system defenses. Additionally, the Dism.exe events show it creating files in a temporary directory and executing them, which could be part of installing or enabling certain features.\n\nThe combination of these actions is concerning. Multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing and creating files, along with disabling Windows Defender, might indicate an attempt to remove security measures or deploy malicious software. The use of Dism.exe in such a way could also be part of system modifications that are not typical user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes accessing and creating files, including disabling Windows Defender, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at these JSONL entries, each with a process name, some Windows log info, and file paths.\n\nFirst, the process is always Dism.exe. I know that Dism is related to Windows deployment and servicing. It's used for tasks like installing updates, adding features, and so on. So, it's a legitimate system process. \n\nLooking at the winlog field, each event says \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. That sounds like a security event indicating that an executable file was created or modified. But Dism.exe is part of Windows, so this might be normal activity during updates or installations.\n\nThe files mentioned are all DLLs with paths pointing to temporary directories under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\... These files have names like DismProv.dll.mui and others. The .mui extension usually stands for Multilingual User Interface, which is part of language packs in Windows. So these might be language resources being loaded.\n\nSince all the events are from the same user (fiddelis), same process, and similar file paths, it seems like Dism.exe is extracting or loading various language DLLs as part of its operation. This is a common behavior when dealing with system updates or configuration changes that require localized resources.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The combination of the process name and the files being accessed align with legitimate Windows operations. No unusual file names, no indicators of compromise like unexpected paths or known malicious file hashes mentioned.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's likely just part of a normal system update or configuration change.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate activity by Dism.exe accessing language resource DLLs during system updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I see multiple entries where processes like Dism.exe and DismHost.exe are loading various .dll files into memory. \n\nFirst off, Dism.exe is known to be part of the Windows Deployment Services, which handles image installations and customizations. It's not unusual for it to load several DLLs during its operation. The events show a consistent pattern where each process loads specific DLLs from the same temporary directory.\n\nI should consider whether these activities are normal or could indicate something malicious. Since Dism.exe is a legitimate system process, and these DLLs seem related to deployment tasks (like SetupPlatformProvider.dll and OfflineSetupProvider.dll), they might be part of standard operations during a system setup or updates.\n\nHowever, the high number of loaded modules in a short time could raise some flags. Malware often loads multiple components quickly, but without additional indicators like unusual file hashes or behaviors, it's hard to say for sure. The paths are temporary and follow a common structure, which aligns with standard deployment processes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the volume is notable, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. This batch doesn't strongly suggest an attack, so I'd classify it as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate processes related to Windows deployment services loading necessary DLLs from a temporary directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first event shows DismHost.exe loading an image, which is SetupPlatformProvider.dll. That seems normal since DismHost is related to Windows deployment services. The second event is the termination of that process. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple events from Dism.exe. The third event logs a file delete for AppxProvider.dll. I remember that Dism.exe is used for disk image management, so deleting files could be part of normal operations. But let me check the rest to see if this continues.\n\nLooking further, several events show file creation time changes and multiple file deletions from the same temporary directory. The paths are all under C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various .dll and .mui files being deleted. This repetition makes me think it's part of a cleanup process after some installation or update.\n\nDism.exe is known for managing Windows images, so these operations could be related to servicing packs or updates being applied. The temporary directory suggests that this is during an install or deployment process where files are extracted and then cleaned up afterward.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or unusual processes here. All the actions are performed by legitimate system tools, and the file paths are standard for such operations. There's a lot of deletions, but they're from known components used in Windows updates.\n\nSo overall, while the activity is extensive, it doesn't indicate malicious behavior. It looks like normal system maintenance.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file operations (loading, deletion) by DismHost.exe and Dism.exe, which are legitimate Windows processes related to disk image management.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this JSON data that was provided. It seems to be a log of some sort, possibly related to system events or security logs on a Windows machine. There are multiple entries, each containing information about a process, a Windows log event, and sometimes a file path.\n\nLet me break down the first entry:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"svchost.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"\n  },\n  \"file\": null\n}\n```\n\nSo, this is an event where a process named svchost.exe has had an image loaded. Svchost.exe is a common system process in Windows, often used by various services. The fact that it's related to Image Load might indicate that a DLL or another module was loaded into its memory space.\n\nLooking at the second entry:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"services.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"\n  },\n  \"file\": null\n}\n```\n\nHere, services.exe is modifying a registry value. Services.exe is another system process involved in managing Windows services and might be part of the Service Control Manager. The change in the registry could be related to service configuration or other system settings.\n\nThe third entry:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"process\": {\n    \"name\": \"sppsvc.exe\"\n  },\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"\n  },\n  \"file\": {\n    \"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSppsvc.exe is associated with the Windows Activation Service, I believe. It's loading the taskschd.dll file, which is part of the Task Scheduler. This makes sense because services related to activation might interact with scheduling tasks.\n\nThe fourth entry mentions \"Windows Update Agent\" as the task, but doesn't have a process or file specified. That suggests it's an event from the Windows Update service checking for updates or performing maintenance.\n\nThere are also entries where both process and file are null, which might indicate events that aren't directly tied to a specific process or file operation, perhaps system-level events or logs without associated files.\n\nNow, considering potential malicious activities, I should think about what these events could mean. Svchost.exe is often used by legitimate services, but it's also a common target for malware because of its elevated privileges. The loading of taskschd.dll by sppsvc.exe could be normal, as Task Scheduler integration is typical.\n\nI need to look for any unusual file paths or processes that don't align with expected system behavior. For instance, if svchost.exe were loading an unexpected DLL from a different location, that might raise red flags. Similarly, changes in the registry without proper authorization could indicate tampering.\n\nIn this case, though, all the files referenced (like taskschd.dll) are legitimate and located in standard Windows directories. The processes involved are also core system processes or related to essential services like activation and scheduling.\n\nSo, while monitoring such logs is crucial for security, based on the information given, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. However, it's always good practice to cross-reference these events with known signatures of malware and ensure that all processes and file operations are authorized and expected.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON data represents system event logs from a Windows machine, detailing process activities, registry changes, and file loads. Here's a structured summary:\n\n1. **Process: svchost.exe**\n   - **Action:** Image loaded (taskschd.dll)\n   - **Note:** Svchost.exe is a legitimate system process often used by services. The loading of taskschd.dll is expected behavior.\n\n2. **Process: services.exe**\n   - **Action:** Registry value set\n   - **Note:** Services.exe is part of the Service Control Manager, and modifying registry values is normal for service management.\n\n3. **Process: sppsvc.exe**\n   - **Action:** Image loaded (taskschd.dll)\n   - **Note:** Sppsvc.exe relates to Windows Activation Service, and loading Task Scheduler components is typical.\n\n4. **Event: Windows Update Agent**\n   - **Action:** System-level update activity.\n   - **Note:** This indicates standard system update checks or maintenance.\n\n5. **Null Entries:**\n   - These represent events without associated processes or files, often generic system notifications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The logs indicate normal system activities and do not show signs of malicious behavior. Processes involved are legitimate, and file operations are within expected locations. However, continuous monitoring is essential for any unexpected deviations."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My goal is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation or not. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there are some empty entries where \"process\" and \"winlog\" don't have any meaningful data. Those might just be noise or unrelated events. Then, starting around line 3, I notice a pattern: multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed with specific command-line arguments. Each time, it's creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable in a path that looks like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". This seems suspicious because using powershell to create services is a common tactic for malware to establish persistence on a system.\n\nFurther down, I see another set of events where powershell is being run with an execution policy set to Restricted. That's interesting because even though the commands here are simple Write-Host statements, it might indicate that the script is trying to run under restricted policies, which could be a way to avoid detection or to execute code that would otherwise be blocked.\n\nThe next part I notice is lines where powershell is querying the 'inf' files in the Windows directory. The command checks each INF file for specific patterns related to installation sections. This could be an attempt to gather information about installed drivers or components, which might be a precursor to installing malicious software or altering system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show repeated powershell executions with varying commands that could indicate a multi-step attack. The initial service creation suggests persistence, the restricted execution policy might be testing the environment's security, and scanning INF files could be part of reconnaissance or an attempt to deploy something malicious based on the findings.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if each individual event is malicious, but the combination raises flags. Malware often uses multiple steps like creating services, using powershell for obfuscation, and performing system checks to ensure it can run without being detected. The repeated attempts and different command types suggest a potential attack campaign rather than isolated incidents.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of harmful actions beyond these signs. It's possible that this is part of legitimate system administration or automated processes. But given the nature of the commands and their repetition, especially the creation of services with specific binaries, I lean towards considering this batch as interesting for further investigation to rule out any malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe executions indicate potential malicious activity, including service creation and system file scanning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event individually.\n\nThe first three events all have the same command line: a PowerShell script executing with ExecutionPolicy Restricted. The script is checking for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. It looks like it's trying to detect whether there are certain sections in these files, specifically related to defaultinstall.nt with different architecture types. That seems pretty technical and possibly could be part of some system configuration or maybe a script that's looking for driver information.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, the first event has 'Provider Lifecycle', which I think relates to how Windows handles drivers or hardware components. The next two events have 'Engine Lifecycle'. Since they're both under Engine Lifecycle, it might be part of normal system operations when certain services or drivers are loaded or unloaded.\n\nThe fourth event is different; it doesn't have a process command line and the winlog task is 'Special Logon', which usually indicates something related to user logon events, perhaps a background service starting under a specific user context.\n\nNow, considering all these together: running PowerShell scripts with certain commands could be malicious, but in this case, the script seems to be reading INF files and checking for known patterns. However, since it's done via PowerShell with restricted execution policy, which is usually safer, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThe repetition of the same command line across multiple events makes me think that maybe a legitimate process is triggering this check periodically. The file field being None in all cases suggests that no files were accessed or written to beyond what's part of normal operations.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity here, like attempts to access restricted areas, unusual file modifications, or network traffic. It seems more like the system is performing routine checks on its own driver information, perhaps during boot or service startup.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, while I'm cautious because PowerShell can be a tool for both good and evil, in this context, it doesn't raise any red flags. The events don't show signs of compromise but rather normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate system checks using PowerShell with restricted execution policies, which is indicative of normal system operations and not malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
