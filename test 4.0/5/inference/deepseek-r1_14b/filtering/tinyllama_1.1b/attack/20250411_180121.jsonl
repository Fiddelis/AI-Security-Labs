{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are in JSONL format with each line containing a JSON object. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file-related data.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple events where 'chrome.exe' is involved. The tasks associated here are network connections detected. That's somewhat normal for Chrome as it's a browser that makes regular internet connections. But I should keep an eye out for unusual frequencies or other indicators of compromise (IoCs). However, in this case, they seem within the expected behavior since Chrome does make connections.\n\nThen, the majority of the events involve 'powershell.exe'. This catches my attention because PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines show that powershell.exe is downloading files from various GitHub repositories. For example:\n\n- \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_base\/objeto_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\"\n- Similar patterns with different paths, like \"modulo_temporario\", \"unidade_base\", etc.\n\nEach of these URLs is pointing to a raw file on GitHub. The commands are using DownloadFile from WebClient, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to fetch remote files without executing them directly, thus avoiding some detection mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n1. The first PowerShell event starts with Process Create and then proceeds to download a file.\n2. Subsequent events show other tasks like Image Load, File Created, and Provider\/Engine Lifecycle changes. This indicates that multiple components are being loaded into memory or written to disk, which can be signs of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, some entries have file paths pointing to temporary directories (e.g., $env:TEMP) where the downloaded files are saved. Temporary locations are often used by malware because they don't require elevated privileges and can be easily cleaned up later, making them harder to detect.\n\nAnother point is that each download is from a different GitHub repository path. While some could be legitimate, the variety and specific paths (like \"modulo_padrao.txt\", \"entrada_comum.txt\") might suggest a coordinated effort or specific modules being downloaded as part of a larger script.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where Chrome interacts with the registry, setting values. This is less common and could indicate potential persistence mechanisms, especially if these changes aren't typical for standard browsing activities.\n\nConsidering all these factors together:\n- The use of PowerShell to download multiple files from GitHub suggests possible remote execution or script downloading.\n- Temporary file storage locations are red flags.\n- The number of such events, each from different repositories, increases suspicion.\n- Registry modifications by Chrome could be part of a persistence mechanism or exfiltration.\n\nWhile isolated events might not raise too many concerns, the combination and frequency suggest a potential malicious campaign. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating to determine if it's part of an attack vector, such as ransomware, APTs, or other malware activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are downloading files from various GitHub repositories into temporary directories, which may indicate malicious activity. Additionally, Chrome.exe events show network connections and registry modifications, raising concerns about potential persistence or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be legitimate but often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. There are several instances where powershell is downloading files from URLs. For example, the command line shows DownloadFile from a GitHub repo. That's a red flag because it could indicate downloading malicious code.\n\nNext, there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks. Attackers often use the registry to maintain persistence or modify system configurations. The events with powershell.exe and reg.exe modifying the registry could be signs of malicious activity.\n\nI also see conhost.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is a legitimate process, but its presence alongside other suspicious activities might warrant investigation.\n\nThe whoami.exe processes are standard for user enumeration, which attackers use to gather info about system users.\n\nThere are several file creation events for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipper; it's unusual to see repeated writes unless the logs are being manipulated or rotated频繁, possibly to delete traces of malicious activity.\n\nThe cmd.exe processes with registry modifications could be part of script execution or used to run commands that are harder to trace.\n\nIn total, the combination of powershell downloads, registry manipulations, and file operations from various processes suggests potential malicious behavior. While some events on their own might not be suspicious, together they paint a concerning picture.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities including powershell.exe downloading files, registry modifications, and repeated process accesses suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm presented with a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through each event one by one to understand what's happening on the system.\n\nThe first few events mention 'powershell.exe' with command lines that seem incomplete or possibly malformed. The tasks associated are things like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, which might be normal PowerShell activity but could also be signs of something more malicious if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe is loading mscoree.dll from the System32 directory. That seems a bit odd because I know that DLLs in System32 are usually legitimate, but sometimes attackers might try to load them for certain operations. Then, other events show powershell.exe accessing various .NET framework components like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll. This could indicate script execution or more nefarious activities.\n\nI notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is involved in different tasks: Image loaded, Registry value set, Process Create, etc. Each of these might be part of normal operations for a legitimate PowerShell use case, but the frequency could raise flags. For example, multiple RegistryEvent tasks within a short time frame might suggest an attempt to modify system configurations or hide traces.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the downloads folder. That seems benign unless it's part of a data exfiltration process, but without more context, it's hard to say. The cmd.exe process running with a \/c command is another point; while that's common for executing scripts or commands, it could be a vector for malicious activity if combined with other events.\n\nLooking further, there are events where processes like Calculator.exe and chrome.exe are modifying the registry. That's more concerning because system utilities like Calculator shouldn't typically make registry changes unless they're running some elevated tasks. Additionally, Chrome modifying the registry might not be standard behavior unless it's updating settings or extensions.\n\nAnother red flag is the creation of a PowerShell script file in the temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. Temporary PowerShell scripts could indicate testing or execution of arbitrary code, which is often a hallmark of malicious activities like testing an environment or dropping payloads.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent tasks and ProcessAccess events tied to powershell.exe are significant. Attackers often use these techniques to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. The fact that multiple registry values are being set might suggest the creation or modification of startup scripts, scheduled tasks, or other persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination raises concerns. The volume and variety of activities involving powershell.exe, coupled with suspicious file creations and registry modifications across multiple processes, point towards potential malicious behavior. This could indicate an active attack, such as credential dumping, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because the aggregate of these events suggests a possible security incident that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and activities, including registry modifications and file creations, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. I'm supposed to determine if they're interesting or not based on the combination of all these events.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to pay attention to. The events show powershell being executed with command lines that include various operations like removing files from the TEMP directory. These specific commands are deleting different .zip files in the TEMP folder.\n\nLooking closer, each of these removals targets specific files: tarefa_base.zip, estrutura_comum.zip, etc. The consistent use of Remove-Item and the -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is designed to clean up without throwing errors if the files aren't found. This behavior could be part of a legitimate cleanup routine, but it might also indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell loads specific DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoreei.dll. These might be part of normal operations, especially since they're related to Windows Defender components, but sometimes attackers use such modules for obfuscation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the user's AppData directory: StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This could be part of setting up a startup routine, potentially malicious if it's intended to run at every login without user consent.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe. While this is typically used for legitimate purposes like checking user information, its presence alongside powershell activities might raise an eyebrow depending on the context.\n\nThe events involving chrome.exe are less concerning. They show registry value sets and loading DLLs, which can be normal operations for a browser process. However, one event shows a registry write, which could indicate some customization or tracking mechanism, but alone it's not enough to be suspicious.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell executions with file deletions in TEMP, creation of files in user directories, loading of system DLLs, and the use of whoami.exe. These activities don't definitively prove malicious intent, but they do suggest potentially high-risk behavior that could warrant further investigation.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.7 because while each individual event isn't conclusive, the combination raises enough red flags to be concerning without being outright evidence of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe executions with file deletions in TEMP directory and creation of files in user directories suggest potentially malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, looking through the events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that remove files from the TEMP directory. For example, one event shows \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\unidade_base.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\". This seems suspicious because PowerShell scripts are often used for malicious activities, especially when they're deleting files in a way that ignores errors and is done with force.\n\nThen there's an event where a file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\" is created and then immediately deleted. Creating and then deleting a script file could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace of malicious activity, which raises red flags.\n\nI also notice that powershell.exe is accessing various files like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me think they might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere's another event where chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are setting registry values. That could be normal, but when combined with other indicators like powershell activity, it adds to the concern.\n\nFinally, there's a whoami.exe execution which is often used by attackers to check permissions or system info. This further supports the idea that this batch might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nPutting all these together—multiple powershell executions with file deletions, script creation\/deletion, and other system accesses—it seems like a coordinated attack rather than random events. Therefore, it's definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity including file deletion attempts, script creation\/deletion, and process access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe being accessed with a ProcessAccess task. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting and can be malicious if it's running suspicious commands. But alone, this could just be normal use.\n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being created. Whoami is typically benign, used to check user information. The command line seems standard, pointing to the system32 directory. No red flags here, but I'll keep an eye out if it's used in combination with other tools.\n\nLooking further, I notice multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and one where it creates a file called pacote_ativo.txt in the user's Downloads folder. The filename \"pacote_ativo\" translates to something like \"active package\" in Portuguese, which might be related to malware distribution or malicious scripts.\n\nThe repetition of powershell.exe ProcessAccess events is concerning. Attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement and executing commands. Having multiple instances could indicate a script running multiple times or an attempt to stay under the radar.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of accessing PowerShell several times and creating a file might suggest that an attacker is using PowerShell to drop malicious files or execute commands. The whoami.exe usage could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering, which are common steps in an attack chain.\n\nI'm also thinking about the confidence level. While each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the pattern—multiple PowerShell accesses and a file creation—is more concerning. It's possible that this is just legitimate activity, but given the nature of these tools being used, it's safer to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and a file being created suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
