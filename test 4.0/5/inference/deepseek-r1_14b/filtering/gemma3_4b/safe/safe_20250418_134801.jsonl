{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. The user is asking me to analyze all these events together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. \n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update**: There are multiple events showing that Microsoft Edge is being updated. Specifically, `setup.exe` is involved in creating and changing file creation times. This seems normal because software updates are common and expected activities.\n   \n2. **CompatTelRunner.exe**: It's loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are related to antivirus and Windows Defender, which are legitimate processes, so nothing suspicious here.\n\n3. **setup.exe Pipe Created**: Pipes in Windows are used for inter-process communication. A setup.exe creating a pipe could be part of the update process, which is normal.\n\n4. **Services.exe Logon Events**: Services.exe is a system process that handles services and logon events. The repeated 'Logon' tasks are standard and not unusual.\n\n5. **Special Logon Task**: This usually relates to system processes or services logging on, which again is normal activity.\n\n6. **User Account Management Events**: Multiple entries here might be due to user login\/logout activities or group policy changes, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, they don't immediately indicate malicious behavior.\n\n7. **taskhostw.exe Loading taskschd.dll**: Task Host processes are used by task scheduler, and loading this DLL is expected for scheduling tasks.\n\n8. **svchost.exe Registry Event**: svchost.exe handles various services, including writing to the registry, which is normal operation.\n\n9. **Powershell Execution**: There's a command line showing powershell.exe running with an execution policy set to Restricted. It reads .inf files and checks for specific patterns. This could be part of system administration or automated tasks, but it's worth closer look because PowerShell is often used in attacks. However, the script here seems benign as it's checking for certain sections in INF files.\n\n10. **File Created by Powershell**: The creation of a file in the StartupProfileData directory might be related to user profile initialization. It doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\n11. **Chrome DNS Query**: Chrome making DNS queries is normal behavior, as it's part of web browsing activities.\n\nPutting all this together, most events are routine system and software updates, service operations, and legitimate processes. The only potentially concerning point is the PowerShell command checking INF files, but without additional context or malicious indicators (like known bad scripts), it's hard to flag this as suspicious. \n\nTherefore, I'd classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity when considering all events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The log entries are primarily related to normal system operations such as updates, service activities, and legitimate process executions.

Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That makes sense since it's probably the log agent itself updating its configuration or data files. Not suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common Windows process that hosts various services, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry. Nothing unusual here.\n\nThen Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems fine; urlmon is part of URL handling in Windows, and Calculator might need some components from there. Not a red flag.\n\nAnother svchost.exe creating a process with parameters for BthAvctpSvc. This looks like a legitimate service host process running under LocalService, which is standard behavior. No issues here.\n\nChrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings and extensions, so this is expected. Not concerning.\n\nMsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll. MsMpEng is related to Windows Defender, and it's normal for it to load system DLLs for functionality. Nothing suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization directory. This could be part of Windows Update or similar services downloading or caching files. It's standard behavior unless these paths seem off, which they don't here.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe both creating and deleting files in the Temp directory. Edge updates often download and then clean up temporary files. The delete action is logged, but it's a normal part of the update process.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading various Defender-related DLLs and creating a lock file in the Temp directory. This aligns with Windows Defender's operation during scans or updates. Nothing unusual.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is used for console applications, and mintty is often part of Cygwin environments. Their registry interactions could be related to configuration settings, which isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the events as a whole, most are standard system processes doing their regular tasks—updating, configuring, loading necessary components. There's no indication of any unusual or malicious activity like multiple failed logins, unexpected file creations in restricted areas, or known malicious process names. The repetition of certain entries (like svchost.exe) is typical and doesn't raise concerns without context suggesting otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole doesn't show anything that stands out as malicious or indicative of an attack. It's mostly normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are primarily normal system processes such as service host activities, file creations\/deletions related to updates and configurations, and standard application behaviors.

My job is to determine if this batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are two events related to \"MpCmdRun.exe\". These processes are logging the loading of image files: MpClient.dll and MpCommu.dll. Since these are parts of Windows Defender, which is a legitimate antivirus\/anti-malware tool, this seems normal. It's just part of the system's regular operation when Defender loads its components.\n\nNext, there's a series of events all originating from \"git.exe\". Each of these has the task as \"File created\" and they're creating files in various subdirectories under \"node_modules\/semver\". This looks like someone is working with Node.js modules, specifically the 'semver' package. Git is commonly used for version control, so this could be part of a developer's workflow—cloning repositories, installing dependencies, etc.\n\nLooking at all these git events together, they're creating a bunch of .js files in different functions subdirectories. This seems like normal activity if someone is using npm (Node Package Manager) to install or manage packages, especially semver which is a standard package for handling semantic versioning. There's nothing here that stands out as malicious or suspicious.\n\nI should also consider the context: these logs could be from a system where a developer is working on a project. The creation of files in node_modules suggests that perhaps dependencies are being installed or the project structure is being set up. No unusual file paths or names jump out; everything aligns with typical development activities.\n\nSince all events relate to legitimate processes—Windows Defender loading its modules and git creating files as part of package management—I don't see any red flags. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, strange file operations, or indicators of malicious behavior like unexpected process creation or network connections.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem interesting for further investigation because all activities appear to be normal and expected based on the system's usage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate processes: Windows Defender loading its components and git creating files during package management.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. So, the first thing I notice is that all these events are JSON objects related to file creation activities on a Windows system. Each line starts with an event where git.exe is the process name, and the task is labeled as \"File created\" under a specific rule.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located within the node_modules directory of a user named fiddelis. The files being created are part of the semver package, which I recognize as a Node.js module used for semantic versioning. These include various JavaScript files like major.js, minor.js, functions\/*.js, and some internal files.\n\nMy initial thought is that these events are typical when a user installs or updates a Node.js package. Git.exe might be part of the process if they're using Git to manage their project, perhaps during a clone, fetch, or install operation. The semver module is commonly used in npm packages for versioning, so seeing multiple files being created under node_modules\/semver suggests that this is part of the installation or update process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unauthorized access, suspicious file names, or activities outside the scope of normal software development. All the paths are within expected directories for a Node.js project setup.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's anything unusual about these events. The fact that multiple files are being created in quick succession could indicate an automated script or build process, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious. It's more likely just part of the package installation flow.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether this kind of activity is commonly monitored or flagged. In most cases, installing packages via npm would generate such events, and they're usually not considered suspicious unless there's a deviation from standard behavior or known patterns of attacks.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the source of these files. Since they're part of semver, which is a widely used and trusted package, the risk of them being malicious is low. Unless there's an unpatched vulnerability in the specific version being used, but that's more about the content than the file creation events themselves.\n\nConsidering all this, I don't find any red flags or evidence pointing towards these events being part of malicious behavior. They seem entirely consistent with normal software development and package management activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files during the installation of a Node.js module (semver) in a typical development environment, indicating normal activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

I've got a bunch of JSONL events here, each one is an event from the system logs. The task is to analyze all these events together and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's about a file being created by git.exe in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\serialize-javascript\". The task is marked as FileCreate. So, this seems like it's part of some file operations.\n\nI see that each event has similar structure: process name is git.exe, the task is File created with a specific rule, and the file path varies but is within the same directory. It looks like multiple files are being created under node_modules for different packages like serialize-javascript, set-blocking, set-function-length, etc.\n\nNode_modules is a standard folder in Node.js projects where third-party libraries are stored. So, if someone is working on a project that uses npm (Node Package Manager), they would have these modules downloaded here. The files created include package.json, index.js, README.md, LICENSE files, and others typical of a node module.\n\nThe process name being git.exe might suggest that Git is involved in managing or cloning the repository, which could be part of setting up the project. Alternatively, maybe it's using Git for version control within the project setup.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The file paths are standard, and the files created are typical for node modules. There's no indication of unusual access times, permissions changes, or attempts to execute these files immediately after creation.\n\nSince all events are related to the same process (git.exe) creating expected files in a project directory, it doesn't raise any red flags. It seems more like routine development activities rather than anything suspicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or anything out of the ordinary. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine file creation activities by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is normal during project setup or development.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. So, I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" \n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that all of them involve the process named \"git.exe.\" The events are all related to files being created, as indicated by the task field in winlog. Each event has a file path pointing to various locations within the user's directory, specifically under node_modules for packages like set-function-length and shebang-command.\n\nHmm, okay, so the first thing that comes to mind is that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in Node.js projects because of npm. The files being created are typical parts of a Node module setup—like package.json, index.js, README.md, etc. These are standard files you'd expect when installing or initializing a project with npm.\n\nI'm noticing multiple events where the same process creates several files under the node_modules directory. This seems normal during a typical npm install operation, where dependencies are being unpacked and their files written to disk. There's nothing unusual about these file creations in terms of naming or location that would raise red flags for malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the consistency of the events. They all follow the same structure: git.exe creating a file under a specific path each time. No deviations or unexpected processes are involved here. The files being created are all standard for Node modules, and there's no indication of any hidden or encrypted files, which could be suspicious.\n\nConsidering the possibility of an attack, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like git for malicious purposes, but in this case, the events don't show anything beyond normal Git operations. There's no evidence of file deletions, writes to unexpected locations, or attempts to execute scripts that would indicate compromise.\n\nAlso, the user context is important. The files are created under the user's Downloads directory within a course folder related to software quality. This suggests it's part of a legitimate development environment rather than something malicious targeting system directories.\n\nI should also think about whether these events could be indicative of lateral movement or data exfiltration, but again, there's nothing here that points in that direction. The files are all static assets being placed in the node_modules folder, which is standard for web and Node.js applications.\n\nIn terms of confidence, since all the indicators point to normal development activities without any signs of tampering or malicious behavior, I would rate this as low confidence in it being interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard file creation operations during the setup of Node.js modules using git.exe, which is normal and expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is in JSONL format, meaning each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. \n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that all the events have \"git.exe\" as the process name. The log type is \"winlog,\" and the task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate).\" Each event also includes a file path that seems to be under the user's Downloads folder, within a directory named after a course, and then into \"node_modules.\" \n\nI'm thinking about what these events could mean. Git is often used for version control, especially in software development. The creation of multiple files under node_modules suggests that someone might be installing or updating Node.js packages, which is normal during development. The fact that all these files are being created by git.exe might indicate a cloning or fetching operation from a remote repository.\n\nBut I should consider whether this activity is unusual or indicative of malicious behavior. Typically, when developers work with Node.js projects, they do use git and node_modules extensively. So seeing multiple file creations in such directories doesn't raise red flags immediately. However, the volume here seems a bit high—14 events all related to the same process and same type of operation.\n\nI need to think about potential indicators of compromise (IOC). Malware often creates files in unexpected locations or attempts to write to system directories. In this case, all the file paths are within a user's Downloads directory and then into their project folders. That doesn't seem suspicious. \n\nAnother angle: Could these events be part of a data exfiltration attempt? If an attacker is trying to move data out of a system, they might create numerous files quickly. But again, in this case, the files are standard Node.js package-related files, which don't carry sensitive information on their own.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern or anomaly in the timestamps of these events. If all these file creations happened within a very short period, it could indicate automated behavior, but without specific timing data, I can't tell for sure.\n\nLooking at each event's structure: The process is always git.exe, which is commonly used and not inherently malicious. The task is \"File created,\" which is a standard Windows audit log entry for file operations. The paths are all within the user's directory, which is expected for local development.\n\nI'm also considering if these events could be part of a legitimate software update or installation process. Node.js modules being updated or installed would naturally result in multiple files being created, especially in node_modules.\n\nGiven that I don't see any signs of unauthorized access, encryption activities, unusual file names, or writes to system directories, the batch doesn't seem to present a high risk. It appears more like normal development activity rather than malicious behavior.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to monitor for anomalies, this set of events falls within typical user activities, especially in a development environment where git and Node.js are commonly used.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during Node.js package installation or updates, which is expected behavior in a development environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event seems to be a log entry related to file creation on Windows. All the entries have \"git.exe\" as the process name and they're all under the same user path.\n\nLooking at the files being created, it's stuff like node_modules with various packages—signal-exit, slice-ansi, sshpk—and their subdirectories. These look like standard Node.js modules, which makes sense if someone is working on a project that uses Git for version control.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is creating these files suggests that this might be part of a Git repository setup or during a clone operation. It's common when you initialize a new Git repository or pull down code with dependencies to have Node.js modules being created in the node_modules directory.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The file paths are typical for a development environment, and all actions are related to creating files as part of the build process. There's no indication of unauthorized access, strange file names, or attempts to execute code outside normal operations.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't seem concerning.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each event: they all have a \"process\" field indicating that git.exe is running. The \"winlog\" shows that a file was created, which triggers an alert via a specific rule called FileCreate. The \"file\" path in each event points to different files under node_modules\/sshpk.\n\nHmm, so the same process (git.exe) is creating multiple files within the sshpk module. Git is commonly used for version control, especially when dealing with Node.js projects as indicated by the presence of node_modules. The sshpk package itself is a known Node.js library used for cryptographic functions related to SSH keys.\n\nI wonder why these file creation events are being flagged. It could be normal behavior during development or deployment when modules are installed or updated. But considering all these files are created at once, maybe it's part of an npm install process where dependencies are extracted and placed into node_modules.\n\nIs there any sign of malicious activity here? The files created seem to be standard parts of the sshpk module—JavaScript libraries, certificates, formats, etc. There’s no indication of suspicious file names or locations outside the expected structure. All events come from the same user (fiddelis) and path structure, which looks like a typical Windows user directory.\n\nI should consider if such activity is common in a normal environment. Yes, when someone clones a repository, installs dependencies with npm install, git might be involved in fetching updates or checking out branches, leading to file creation events in node_modules. So, this doesn't raise any red flags for malicious behavior; it seems routine.\n\nAre there any other angles? Maybe checking the timestamps of these events—if they’re all very close together, that fits with an install process. Also, if git.exe is creating files in a known legitimate way, like during a checkout or sync, it's expected. No evidence here suggests unauthorized access or malicious script activity.\n\nIn conclusion, while each file creation event on its own might look notable, when considered as a whole batch, they all fit within normal software development and dependency management processes.

There are various subdirectories like lib, man, etc., each with different JavaScript and text files.\n\nHmm, git.exe is a version control tool.

The files being created are all within the node_modules directory of a user's download folder. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I notice that all events share the same process name, git.exe, which is commonly used for version control systems like Git. That's not unusual on its own since developers use Git regularly. However, the fact that multiple files are being created under node_modules suggests this might be part of a software development or setup process. Node modules are standard in JavaScript projects managed by npm (Node Package Manager), so it's possible someone is installing dependencies or cloning a repository.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they include both .js and .d.ts files, which are TypeScript definition files. The presence of these along with package.json indicates that this could be part of setting up a project with TypeScript support. The specific packages like \"tcomb-validation\" and \"tcomb\" seem to be npm packages, which further supports the idea that this is related to development activities.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created in quick succession under node_modules might raise an eyebrow because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. However, considering the context—the files are part of a standard package structure and their names suggest they're part of type definitions and modules—it's less likely to be malicious. Plus, git.exe is typically used benignly in development environments.\n\nI should also think about whether this activity could indicate something more sinister. Could these file creations be part of a larger attack? If the user is indeed working on a project, then no. But if there's no context suggesting development work, maybe it's worth looking into. However, without additional indicators like unusual file contents or execution logs, I can't confidently say it's malicious.\n\nThe consistency in process name and task type suggests automated script activity, which could be either legitimate (like a CI\/CD pipeline) or part of an attack. But again, the file paths lean towards normal development behavior rather than anything suspicious.\n\nSo, putting this all together: multiple files being created by git.exe under node_modules likely indicate standard npm package installations or project setups. Without signs of anomalies like unexpected file hashes or permissions changes, I'm leaning towards this batch not being particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by git.exe under node_modules, which is typical during development setup.

So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures. Each line starts with \"process\" indicating that the process name is \"git.exe\". Then there's a Windows log entry where the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and finally, the file path is something under the user's Downloads folder in a specific directory.\n\nSo, I notice that all these events are related to files being created by git.exe. The paths point to different JavaScript files within a node_modules directory. Specifically, it's for a module called \"tcomb\". Node Modules are where npm packages are stored, so this seems like normal activity when installing or updating dependencies with npm.\n\nEach file path is unique but follows a pattern, like Nil.js, Number.js, etc., which are typical library files. The fact that they're all being created by git.exe might suggest it's part of a repository sync or clone process. Git often clones repositories and checks out files into the node_modules when dependencies are managed.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file paths, no writes to unexpected locations, and all activities are tied to a user's development directory. The consistent naming and structure reinforce that this is standard operation for someone using Node.js and Git for software development.\n\nThe confidence level would be high because there's nothing out of the ordinary in these logs. They fit the profile of routine file creation during development or dependency management.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple entries show git.exe creating files within a node_modules directory, which is typical for npm package installations and does not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each event shows that git.exe is creating a file in the node_modules directory under a specific user's downloads folder. The files being created are JavaScript modules like fromJSON.js and isBoolean.js.\n\nHmm, git.exe is typically used for version control. It's common to see it accessing files during development or when updating repositories. Node_modules is where npm packages are stored, so these file creations might just be part of a developer's workflow installing dependencies or syncing code.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is unusual. Since all events are similar and from the same process, it doesn't look like there's any variation that would indicate malicious behavior. There's no evidence of access to sensitive files, unusual permissions, or deviations from standard operations. It seems consistent with normal git and npm usage.\n\nAlso, the paths being created are all within a specific project directory related to \"Qualidade de Software.\" This suggests it's part of a legitimate development activity rather than something malicious that would spread across different directories or systems.\n\nSo, while monitoring is good, this batch doesn't raise any red flags.

Since all events show the same process creating multiple files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development or when running npm commands. Git can be used for version control and might be part of a build process that copies or creates these files.\n\nI should check if there's anything unusual here. The user 'fiddelis' seems to be working on a project, possibly in an educational setting given the course name \"Qualidade de Software.\" Node_modules is a standard directory for npm packages, so creating files there doesn't raise red flags immediately.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity? No, these are just file creations during normal operations. There's no evidence of privilege escalation, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute code outside the expected behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch is likely not interesting for further investigation as it appears to be part of legitimate software development activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development or build processes.
