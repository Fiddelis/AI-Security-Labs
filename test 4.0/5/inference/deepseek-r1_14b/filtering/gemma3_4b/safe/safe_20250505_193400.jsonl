{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_193400.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got a bunch of events here from Windows logs, each in JSONL format. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at the first event: it's about the Registry process and task is Process Creation. That seems normal because the registry is a core system component, so its processes are standard.\n\nThe second event has null process info and the task is SystemStart. Again, that sounds like part of the system booting up, which is expected.\n\nNext, VsmPolicyEnablement – not sure about that one, but it doesn't ring any immediate bells as malicious. Then there's DirtyBootShutdown and BootMenuPolicy tasks. These also seem related to system startup and shutdown processes, which are routine.\n\nThe BootType task would be something the system checks during boot, so nothing unusual there. LeapSecondDataUpdate sounds like a time-related update, probably handled by Windows automatically.\n\nThen another Process Creation event with null process info – maybe just another standard service or application starting up. The smss.exe process creation is interesting because I know that's part of the operating system, specifically related to session management. So this seems normal too.\n\nDirtyTransition and BatteryCountChange events are about hardware changes, which are pretty common, especially if someone is moving a laptop around or plugging in\/out devices.\n\nPutting it all together, these events are all standard Windows startup and process creation activities. No signs of unusual processes, failed logins, network connections, or other red flags that might indicate malicious activity. Each event relates to system initialization, hardware detection, or time updates, which are expected during normal operation.\n\nSo, considering the entire batch, there's nothing here that stands out as suspicious or out of the ordinary. The confidence level is high because all events align with known legitimate activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard system startup and process creation activities, which do not indicate any malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
