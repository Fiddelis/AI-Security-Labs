{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries. Each line represents an event with process information, Windows log tasks, and file details.\n\nFirst, most of the early logs are from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome handles a lot of network traffic and DNS lookups when browsing. Nothing suspicious there on its own.\n\nThen, I notice powershell.exe appearing multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to pay attention to. The first entry shows 'Process Create' which isn't too concerning by itself, but the command line in one of the entries caught my eye. It has a complex command-line argument with paths like \"C:\\\\registro_logico\\\\estrutura_secundario\\\\..\\\\unidade_ativo\\\\objeto_padraounidade_padrao.txt\". Those file paths look suspicious— registry_logico, estrutura_secundario, and unidade_ativo sound like they might be part of a Portuguese-speaking country's local files. Also, the command is using Get-ChildItem to modify LastWriteTime to an old date (01\/01\/1970). That seems unusual because modifying file timestamps could be an attempt to hide activity or make files appear older.\n\nLooking further, there are several Image Load events from powershell.exe. Loading various .NET and DLL files is normal for PowerShell scripts, but combined with the earlier command-line activity, it might indicate that the script is doing more than just benign operations.\n\nThere's also a File Created event followed by a File Delete logged. Creating and then deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to leave no trace of malicious code, which raises my suspicion. Additionally, there are Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe. Modifying the registry is another common tactic for persistence or configuration changes that might be malicious.\n\nThe pipe created event from powershell.exe could indicate communication with another process, possibly a way to execute commands or pass data between different scripts or even with other running processes. This adds to the concern about potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments and file operations that suggest an attempt to alter file metadata and delete traces, combined with registry modifications and pipe creation, points towards possible malicious behavior. While individual events might not be alarming, the sequence and combination of actions here make the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple instances of powershell.exe performing potentially suspicious activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and loading external libraries.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm seeing a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event from system logs. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they indicate something malicious.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are several entries where powershell.exe is involved. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can do both good and bad things. The command lines in these events show that powershell is executing some script using Get-ChildItem to list files in certain directories and then modifying their LastWriteTime to a very old date, 01\/01\/1970. That seems suspicious because changing file timestamps can be part of hiding malicious activities or making files look older than they are.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe is loading MpClient.dll, which might be related to antivirus software, but sometimes attackers can abuse legitimate processes for their own purposes. Additionally, there are events from svchost.exe and conhost.exe modifying the registry, which could indicate attempts to persistence or change system configurations. Svchost is a common process that hosts various services, so it's not inherently bad, but unusual activity here might be cause for concern.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file by powershell.exe in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This could mean the script is trying to persist across reboots or execute at startup, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some events that seem normal, like calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL used for URL parsing. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating its configuration file doesn't raise any red flags—it's likely part of log management software.\n\nBut considering all these together: multiple powershell executions with similar command structures, registry modifications from various processes, and the attempt to create startup files might indicate a coordinated attack. The repeated use of powershell to modify file times and system configurations could be part of an attacker's toolkit for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is definitely malicious because sometimes scripts can do legitimate things like clean up old logs, but the pattern here seems too consistent with malicious behavior. The combination of process activity, registry changes, and file modifications points towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with command-line arguments that modify file timestamps, registry value sets by svchost.exe, and the creation of files in non-standard locations suggest potential malicious activity or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze the provided JSONL events as a whole to determine if they are interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where different processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values. These actions alone might not be suspicious, but their frequency or combination could raise flags. For instance, multiple registry writes from various executables might indicate configuration changes, possibly malicious in nature.\n\nThen there's a significant number of events (13 instances) where chrome.exe is involved in setting registry values. This stands out because Chrome typically doesn't modify system-wide registry settings frequently unless it's part of some update or customization process. The repetition here could suggest an attempt to alter the system's configuration, which might be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are two events related to file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is often used for log management, so its activity might not be suspicious on its own. However, the fact that it's creating a new config file could indicate a setup or deployment process, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is normal.\n\nThe event where chrome.exe loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory seems concerning. This DLL is part of Microsoft's anti-malware platform, so seeing Chrome interact with it might not be unusual, but combined with the other registry activity, it could hint at a broader system compromise or manipulation.\n\nPowershell.exe is also flagged in multiple events. Since PowerShell can execute scripts and perform various system operations, any abnormal use of it should raise an eyebrow. Its file creation event adds to the suspicion, especially if it's part of a larger campaign.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are several red flags: multiple processes modifying registry settings, repeated actions by chrome.exe, and the involvement of powershell.exe. These could be indicative of malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to avoid detection. While each event individually might not be too concerning, their combination suggests a potential security issue that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including chrome.exe, powershell.exe, and others show repeated registry modifications and file creation activities, which may indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
