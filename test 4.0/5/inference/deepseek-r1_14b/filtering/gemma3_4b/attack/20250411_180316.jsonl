Another cmd.exe changing the registry.\n18. WMIC.exe deleting processes and loading modules.\n\nLooking at these, I notice several instances where powershell.exe is accessing or running tasks. Powershell can be used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Also, there are multiple svchost.exe modifying the registry, which is unusual because svchost is typically a legitimate process but can be used by malware to hide activities.\n\nThe cmd.exe commands stand out too, especially the one with WMIC.exe deleting notepad.exe processes. That seems suspicious because it's an administrative command often used to terminate processes, possibly to cover tracks or remove competition from other running processes. Additionally, WMIC is another tool that can be malicious if misused.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of urlmon.dll by calc.exe and wmic.exe. This could indicate some form of code injection or unauthorized access since these modules are typically part of Windows but shouldn't be loaded by such processes without a legitimate reason.\n\nOverall, while there's a mix of normal activities like file creation by winlogbeat and legitimate process creations, the volume of registry modifications, powershell activity, and use of administrative tools like cmd.exe and WMIC raise concerns about potential malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Defender uses various components, but sometimes malicious actors might abuse legitimate tools, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, several events involve notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe accessing registry keys. The tasks are \"Registry value set\" which is a common activity for configuration changes, but multiple processes doing this could indicate suspicious activity, like installing malware or setting persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines: there's a whoami.exe run without any arguments. That's often used to check user privileges, which is something an attacker might do after gaining access. Then, cmd.exe is used with \"\/c\" to execute commands. The first cmd line copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. This could be replacing system tools, potentially for persistence or malicious activity. Another cmd command deletes a scheduled task named win32times using schtasks. Deleting tasks might hide activities or remove traces.\n\nThere's also a schtasks.exe command used to delete the same task. That's redundant but confirms that multiple methods are being used to manipulate scheduled tasks.\n\nPowershell.exe is appearing multiple times with various actions, including accessing processes and registry keys. PowerShell is powerful and often abused by attackers for its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands remotely. The repeated ProcessAccess tasks might indicate attempts to gain information or privileges.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several red flags here. Multiple instances of legitimate tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe being used with potentially malicious command lines, registry modifications, process access, and manipulation of scheduled tasks suggest possible unauthorized activity. This could be part of an attack chain, such as establishing persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of events—especially the command-line arguments and multiple tools being used in a coordinated manner—points to malicious behavior rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, process creation with specific commands, and potential file replacement suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of processes being logged. The first line is about 'schtasks.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll'. That seems normal because schtasks is related to scheduled tasks in Windows. Next up is 'svchost.exe' making changes to the registry. Svchost is a common system process, so that doesn't immediately raise flags.\n\nThen there's 'cmd.exe' and 'conhost.exe' both setting registry values. I know cmd is just the command prompt, and conhost might be related to console services. Registry activity alone isn't unusual unless it's combined with other actions.\n\nI see several entries for 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. However, looking at the events, it seems like powershell is just being accessed or created without any malicious commands mentioned. The tasks are things like 'ProcessAccess' and 'Registry value set', which could be legitimate.\n\nThere's also an entry for 'whoami.exe' being run from the system32 directory. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that doesn't seem suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother thing I notice is repeated instances of processes like cmd.exe and chrome.exe accessing or setting registry values. Chrome might be doing this for its extension management or settings, which isn't unusual.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, most of these events are normal system activities. There are multiple entries of process creations and registry changes, but without evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors, I don't see a clear sign that this batch is concerning.\n\nHowever, the high number of powershell.exe instances stands out a bit. Attackers often use powershell for lateral movement or executing commands, so multiple accesses could be a red flag. But since there's no specific indication of misuse here, like suspicious command lines or access to sensitive files, it might just be legitimate admin activity.\n\nI'm also considering if the repeated process creations and registry modifications are part of a normal workflow or something more nefarious. Without additional context, such as timestamps or user information, it's hard to tell, but based on what's provided, there's no concrete evidence of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal system processes and registry activities without signs of malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's a whoami.exe process running. That's usually a common tool for users to check their permissions. Not inherently bad, but I should keep it in mind.\n\nThen, there are several events related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers because it can execute scripts and do system-level stuff. The fact that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed makes me a bit cautious. \n\nLooking closer, the logs show that powershell.exe is accessing registry values. That's not unusual on its own, but when combined with other actions, it could be part of malicious activity. Also, there are file creation and deletion events for a PowerShell script in the user's temp directory. Creating and then deleting a script file might be an attempt to avoid detection or leave no trace.\n\nThe script path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The fact that it's in the Temp folder and has a random-looking name suggests it's temporary, which could be part of legitimate operations or an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs when powershell.exe runs. This is normal for PowerShell as it loads different components, but sometimes attackers might load specific libraries that could indicate malicious behavior. The presence of mscoree.dll and others related to .NET might be part of legitimate operations or could be indicators of certain attacks.\n\nThere are also Provider Lifecycle events with command lines running powershell.exe multiple times. This repetition makes me think there's something ongoing—maybe a script running in a loop or some automated process, which is more concerning if it's not expected.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a config file. That seems normal if this is part of log management software, but I should check if this is an authorized process.\n\nThe high number of events around powershell.exe—process creation, registry access, image loading, and file operations—combined with the temporary script file deletion makes me think there's something worth investigating.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I see a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event. My task is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: most of them are PowerShell.exe. That's already a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts. But I need to look deeper into what these events are showing.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. The first few events show that PowerShell is loading various DLL files, like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. Legitimate processes do load libraries, so on its own, this might not be suspicious. However, the specific paths could indicate something. For example, MpClient.dll is related to Windows Defender, which is legitimate, but sometimes attackers can abuse legitimate tools.\n\n2. There are multiple events where PowerShell creates files in user directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local... This might not be malicious per se, but it's worth noting because scripts often create configuration or log files here.\n\n3. The registry value sets and process accesses could be part of legitimate operations, but again, attackers sometimes modify the registry to hide their tracks or change system configurations.\n\n4. There are several events where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of .bat files in various paths. These look like they're testing whether certain scripts exist before proceeding. This behavior could be part of a script checking if it's running in an environment it's familiar with, which might indicate some form of persistence or lateral movement.\n\n5. The process names include whoami.exe, which is typically used to check user information. If this is called by another process like PowerShell, it could be for privilege escalation or reconnaissance purposes.\n\n6. The repeated calls to 'Process Create' and 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks might indicate that the system is spawning multiple processes, possibly as part of a chain of command where each script call leads to another process.\n\nPutting all these together: Multiple instances of PowerShell with varied command-line arguments checking for specific files, creating new files, accessing processes, and modifying registry entries. These behaviors don't definitively prove malicious activity, but they do raise eyebrows because:\n\n- PowerShell is commonly used in attacks.\n- The repeated checks for .bat scripts could be part of a script that only runs if certain conditions are met (like not being in a sandboxed environment).\n- File creation and registry modifications can be signs of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to avoid detection.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible that this is part of legitimate system administration tasks or automated processes. However, given the nature of the events and their repetition, especially with the .bat file checks and PowerShell usage, I lean towards considering this batch as potentially malicious or at least indicative of suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n\nSo, my classification would be INTERESTING because there are several red flags, even if individually they might not be conclusive. The combination suggests possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with varied command-line arguments checking for specific files, creating new files, accessing other processes, and modifying registry entries.

Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from powershell.exe. This is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so it's definitely something to keep an eye on. The logs show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so by themselves they might not be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are file creation and deletion events related to PowerShell scripts in temporary directories. For instance, a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 is created and then deleted. This behavior could indicate that the script was tested or executed briefly before being removed. Malware often uses such techniques to avoid detection, so this might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking further, there's activity where powershell.exe checks for specific files in certain directories using command lines. The commands test if files like objeto_ativo\\objeto_temporario_script.bat and modulo_logico\\componente_padrao exist. This could be part of a script checking its environment or attempting to drop additional malicious components. The presence of such checks might suggest some form of persistence or payload delivery.\n\nAdditionally, there are several registry value set events from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome modifying the registry is normal for settings and extensions, multiple such events without context could be suspicious if they involve unknown keys or repeated writes, possibly indicating malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of PowerShell loading DLLs, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, checking for specific files, and setting registry values suggests potential malicious behavior. However, some actions are legitimate, like normal PowerShell usage or Chrome operation. To be sure, more context would be needed on the environment and user activities around these events.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because while not all events are clearly malicious, there's a cluster of behaviors that together could indicate something nefarious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and registry modifications, which may indicate potential malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

All the events involve powershell.exe processes, which immediately raises some red flags because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nLooking closely, each event shows that powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The commands are creating new items in various file paths and setting content to \"dir\". This seems suspicious because creating multiple batch files with names like script.bat and writing \"dir\" as their content could be part of a larger malicious script.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where the task is 'Registry value set' and several image loads from different .NET framework locations. While these aren't inherently malicious on their own, they do indicate that the process is loading various components which could be part of obfuscating or executing additional code.\n\nI notice that some of the command lines are creating files in different directories using relative paths. This pattern suggests an attempt to spread across the system or perhaps create persistence points for later execution. The use of multiple directory levels and varying file names might be an effort to avoid detection or to make manual analysis harder.\n\nAnother point is that each event with a 'Provider Lifecycle' task also involves writing a new script file. These could potentially be dropped scripts used for lateral movement or privilege escalation, which are common signs in attack chains.\n\nConsidering the combination of all these events—multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files and accessing registry and image components—it's reasonable to suspect that this activity is part of an ongoing malicious process. The repetitive nature of the command lines and file operations adds to the concern, as it doesn't align with typical user behavior or legitimate script execution patterns.\n\nWhile there's no direct evidence of harmful code being executed in these events, the pattern and volume of the activities suggest a possible attack vector.

This is normal for PowerShell as it runs scripts and loads necessary libraries, but I should keep an eye on any unusual modules being loaded.\n\nThen, I notice several file creation events by PowerShell. They're creating .bat files in different directories. Creating new batch files might be part of setting up a persistence mechanism or dropping malware components. Also, the paths look a bit generic, which could indicate some automated script trying to set things up.\n\nThere are registry value sets by both PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be a red flag because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nLooking at all these events together: multiple file creations of .bat scripts, registry modifications, and repeated use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments.

The paths in these commands look a bit structured but not obviously malicious yet. However, it's a bit unusual to see multiple such checks in quick succession from the same user or process.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell creates temporary files in different locations, like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp'. That makes me think about script execution because scripts often create temp files. The creation and deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1' is notable—temporarily creating a script file could be part of testing or executing malicious code.\n\nAlso, there are events where PowerShell interacts with the registry and processes. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often use them to persistence or modify system configurations. The fact that there's a 'Registry value set' event without any obvious legitimate reason could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, the creation of configuration files like '.winlogbeat.yml.new' by winlogbeat.exe doesn't seem malicious on its own, but combined with other events, it might indicate some unauthorized tooling or script activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple PowerShell executions checking for specific files, temporary file creations and deletions, registry changes—it seems like there's a pattern of potentially malicious activities.

Each script exits based on whether these files exist. These scripts could be part of legitimate checks or malicious activities like ensuring payload components are present before executing further commands.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the events: Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Image Load. The variety suggests different stages of activity—initial process creation, file access, registry modifications, and loading of libraries which is typical for PowerShell scripts.\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines across multiple events indicates possible iterations or loops, which might be normal but could also signal persistence mechanisms where the script runs multiple times to check conditions.\n\nConsidering the files involved, they're spread across different directories, some named in Portuguese, which might not be standard. This could be an attempt to hide or use non-standard locations, a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThe fact that both \"whoami.exe\" and PowerShell are used raises flags because attackers often chain commands using these tools.

This is a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously. However, the files being created are in temporary directories and seem related to script policy tests, which could be legitimate user scripts or system checks.\n\nThere are also events where specific paths are checked using Test-Path commands in PowerShell. These might indicate an attempt to verify if certain executables exist before proceeding, possibly as part of a benign check or malicious payload deployment.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary files, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. This could be part of script execution for testing or configuration, but it's worth noting that the file is deleted immediately after creation, which might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nI see a few process creations: whoami.exe and cmd.exe. These are common tools for users to check their permissions or run commands, so alone they're not suspicious unless used in conjunction with other activities.\n\nLooking at the registry events from powershell.exe, these could be modifying system configurations, which is another area that requires attention because attackers often alter registry settings to maintain persistence.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess tasks on powershell.exe might indicate monitoring or interaction with other processes, which could be part of legitimate administration tasks or malicious activity like process injection.\n\nOverall, the batch shows a lot of PowerShell activity with file and registry manipulation.

However, sometimes it's just legitimate use. Looking at the command lines, I notice several instances where powershell.exe runs scripts that check if certain paths exist on the filesystem.\n\nFor example, one of the commands checks if \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\estrutura_comum\\src\\estrutura_temporario.cs\" exists and exits with 0 or 1 based on the result. This behavior seems suspicious because it's testing for specific file paths, which could be part of a larger script to ensure files are present before proceeding.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple similar commands across different events, each checking various paths.

The use of Test-Path suggests they're verifying file existence, which in some cases can be part of malicious scripts trying to locate certain files for exploitation or deletion.\n\nAdditionally, the logs show powershell.exe accessing registry values and loading various .NET framework components.

It raises my suspicion because deleting log files or scripts quickly can help cover tracks.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though they aren't provided), if these events are happening in quick succession, it might indicate a sequence of malicious activities. For example, checking for a script's presence, executing it, and then cleaning up logs could be part of an attack chain.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple variations in the command lines with different paths (like C:\\registro_base\\..., C:\\unidade_temporario\\...) suggests some kind of persistence mechanism or maybe testing across different locations. It feels like someone is trying to ensure their malicious script exists before executing it, possibly indicating they're checking multiple fallback locations.\n\nAnother point is that the user involved is \"fiddelis,\" which might be a clue if this user is known for legitimate activity or not. If this account isn't typically used for such scripts, it could indicate unauthorized access.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That seems unrelated to the PowerShell activities unless it's part of log tampering, but without more context, it might just be normal log management.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances checking for script existence, quick file creation\/deletion in temp folders, varied paths suggesting persistence checks, and potential use of a non-standard user account. These factors increase the suspicion that this batch is indicative of malicious activity aimed at avoiding detection or preparing for an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command lines checking for script existence, file creation and deletion in temporary folders, and varied paths suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence checks or log tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}

Multiple entries show powershell.exe being accessed and creating files. That's interesting because while PowerShell is legitimate for admin tasks, it's often used in attacks to hide malicious activities.\n\nThere are also instances where whoami.exe is run with the command line pointing to system32. Whoami is usually benign but can be part of privilege escalation or info gathering by attackers.\n\nI see some network connections from svchost.exe and chrome.exe. Svchost is a common process, but unusual network activity could indicate C2 communication. Chrome's multiple network connections might just be normal browsing, but the frequency is high, which raises an eyebrow.\n\nRegistry modifications are happening with both PowerShell and svchost.exe. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware, so that adds to the suspicion.\n\nSome processes like winlogbeat and notepad are present, but their actions seem less concerning compared to the other activities.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of legitimate and potentially malicious behaviors. The repeated use of PowerShell, whoami, registry edits, and network connections from svchost could indicate an active attack or some form of lateral movement within the network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, including file creation and registry modifications, alongside network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first log shows Chrome doing a DNS query—that seems normal. Next, there are several entries from PowerShell accessing processes and registry values. That catches my attention because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. \n\nLooking closer, I notice multiple instances where PowerShell creates new processes and accesses the registry. There's also a file being created and then deleted in the same location—C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. This temporary file might be part of script execution, which could indicate something suspicious.\n\nFurthermore, there are several Image Load events from different DLLs. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, the repeated loading of these files might warrant closer inspection to ensure they're not being used maliciously.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which can be a sign of inter-process communication, potentially hiding command-line arguments or activities.\n\nOverall, the repetitive and varied actions from PowerShell suggest possible script execution. Since some of these actions could be part of an attack, especially considering the file creation and deletion in a temp directory, I classify this batch as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell executing commands, accessing registry values, creating files, and deleting them.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several events where `powershell.exe` is being executed with command lines that include commands like `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, and `gci -recurse`. These look like PowerShell commands that could be used to list files and directories recursively. The fact that it's using multiple commands in one line might indicate scripting or automated behavior.\n\nNext, the tasks under `winlog` vary between different lifecycle events for processes and file creations. For example, there are mentions of `Image loaded`, `Engine Lifecycle`, and several instances where files are being created. One such file is a `.yml.new` file in the `data` directory, which might be part of some configuration or log file setup.\n\nThere's an event where `powershell.exe` sets a registry value using `RegistryEvent`. That's notable because modifying the Windows Registry can be indicative of malicious activity since it often involves persistence mechanisms. Similarly, there are instances where other processes like `conhost.exe` set registry values. I should check if these changes are legitimate or part of normal system operations.\n\nLooking at the files created, one is in a user's `Downloads` folder named `estrutura_secundario.txt`. That name doesn't immediately raise red flags, but paired with the PowerShell activity, it could be part of some data exfiltration or configuration. Another file path points to a `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` which seems related to PowerShell profile configurations, possibly setting up persistent tasks.\n\nI also notice that `winlogbeat.exe`, likely an agent for log management, is creating files in its own directory. That seems normal unless it's behaving abnormally elsewhere, but nothing stands out here.\n\nConsidering the frequency of these events within a short period, multiple instances of PowerShell executions and registry modifications could suggest suspicious behavior. The repeated use of `powershell.exe` with similar command-line arguments might be part of a script execution or an attack chain, such as initial access followed by lateral movement or data collection.\n\nThe combination of process creation, file writes, and registry changes is often seen in both legitimate scripts and malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or credential dumping. Without additional context on the user's environment and baseline behavior, it's hard to be certain, but these patterns are enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands, including potential file enumeration and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious activity or suspicious scripting.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
