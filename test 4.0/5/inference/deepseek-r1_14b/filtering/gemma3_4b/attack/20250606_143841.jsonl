PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so it's worth noting but not immediately suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is usually benign as it just reports user info.\n\nNext, multiple events show powershell.exe accessing different files and registry values. The file paths seem normal at first glance, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are standard for .NET Framework. But the creation of a temp script '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1' is interesting because temporary PowerShell scripts can be used maliciously to execute code or test policies.\n\nThe script gets created and then deleted shortly after. This could indicate an attempt to avoid detection by creating, testing, and then removing evidence. The use of 'Registry value set' also stands out as attackers often modify the registry to persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are several instances where powershell.exe is creating pipes and accessing other processes. While some of these actions can be legitimate, the repeated creation and deletion of files along with registry modifications might suggest malicious activity. The combination of multiple process creations and deletions could be part of a cleanup routine after executing something bad.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern shows a potential script being tested or executed in a way that tries to hide its tracks.

All the events involve processes being created and accessed, especially powershell.exe. There are multiple instances where powershell is accessing files and registry entries, which could be normal admin tasks but might also indicate something suspicious.\n\nI notice that several powershell.exe processes create temporary files in C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1. Creating a script file there could be part of testing or legitimate scripting, but it's often used by malware to avoid detection. Then, the same file is deleted shortly after, which might be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThere are also multiple ImageLoad events for various .dll files related to .NET and PowerShell. While these are standard, the combination with other actions could raise flags. Additionally, there's a whoami.exe process running, which might be checking user permissions or system informationâ€”something attackers often do.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe in different ways, including command lines that look suspicious (like \"& {}\"), is concerning. Malware often uses such techniques to hide its activities and execute code. The fact that multiple events are chained together suggests a possible script running several commands, which could be malicious in nature.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows behavior that's not entirely normal.

Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events are related to powershell.exe. There are multiple entries where powershell is either being created, accessed, or loading various modules. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously, so repeated activity from it could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged: there's a lot of Process Create events for powershell, which might indicate multiple instances running. The RegistryEvent and FileCreate\/Delete entries suggest that something is modifying system settings or creating files on disk. Specifically, I see a file being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1. This seems unusual because why create a script file only to delete it right after? Maybe it's trying to avoid detection or testing if scripts are allowed.\n\nThere are also several ImageLoad events for various DLLs, which is normal when running powershell, but the specific paths mentioned don't immediately raise red flags unless they're known malicious ones. The FileDeleteDetected event on that script file could be a sign of an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there's a Pipe Created event, which might indicate communication between processes, possibly for command execution or data transfer. This could be part of a larger attack chain, like downloading malware components or executing commands over a pipe.\n\nConsidering the combination: multiple powershell instances, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and pipe activity. These behaviors together are indicative of potentially malicious activity.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events involve several processes and actions in Windows. The first event is \"whoami.exe\" being run with a command line path that seems normal. It's just querying user information, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries for \"powershell.exe\". PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in cmdlets that can do both legitimate and malicious tasks. But not all uses of PowerShell are bad. I need to see what each event indicates.\n\nLooking at the events:\n- Some show that PowerShell accessed files or registry values.\n- One event shows a file being created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest, which is unusual and could be part of script execution testing.\n- Another event deletes this same file shortly after it was created. The fact that the file was deleted right after creation might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nThere's also a command line in one of the PowerShell events: \"& {if (Test-Path \\\\\"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This script is checking if a specific file exists. If it does, it exits with success; otherwise, it fails. The path looks like it's trying to reach \"procdump.exe\" through multiple directories, which might be an attempt to bypass certain security measures or access restricted files.\n\nConsidering all these together:\n- Multiple PowerShell instances being created and accessed.\n- Creation of a temporary file that's immediately deleted.\n- A script attempting to check for the existence of another file in a non-standard path.\n\nThese actions could indicate attempts at lateral movement, persistence, or testing system defenses. The repeated use of PowerShell and the specific file operations might be part of an attack chain. While not conclusive on their own, the combination raises red flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with potentially malicious scripts and actions, including creating and deleting temporary files, accessing registry values, and checking for specific file paths.

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the entries are from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused by attackers. The tasks listed include things like image loaded, file created, and process access. Specifically, seeing 'MpClient.dll' being loaded might raise an eyebrow because that's related to Windows Defender, which is a legitimate process, but sometimes malware tries to mimic or inject into such processes.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. 'whoami' is a standard tool for getting user information, but repeated use could be suspicious if not explained by normal activity. It's usually used to check permissions or credentials, which might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nLooking further, I see a command line: \"cmd.exe \/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". That command turns off Windows Defender Firewall, which is a common step in malware activities to disable the firewall and allow further attacks. This seems concerning because it's actively altering system security settings.\n\nThere are also several entries from 'svchost.exe', which is another process that can be tricky because many legitimate services run under svchost, but it's often used by malware as well. The registry events (value sets and object changes) could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or install persistent malware components.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell executions with various actions, including loading DLLs, creating files in user directories, accessing processesâ€”combined with attempts to disable the firewall and registry modifications by svchost. This looks like a potential attack chain where an attacker is trying to establish persistence, disable defenses, and possibly drop malware components.\n\nThe confidence level here is high because several red flags are present: disabling firewall, using PowerShell for potentially malicious tasks, and suspicious registry changes.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The structure seems consistent across all lines. Each has three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the 'process' field, every single one of these events shows that the process name is 'svchost.exe'. Now, I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used by services to host other components. It's pretty common for system processes and can be part of various services. However, it's also known that svchost.exe can sometimes be exploited by malware because it's a standard process and might not raise as many suspicions.\n\nThe 'winlog' field in each event mentions a task: \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\". So this indicates that there was an activity related to the Windows registry. The registry is a critical part of the operating system, storing configurations for hardware, software, and user preferences. Any modifications here can be significant because they can affect system behavior and persistence mechanisms.\n\nNow, I'm considering why multiple events like these would occur. If it's legitimate activity, such as during system updates or service installations, there might be a few such events. But the fact that there are 25 consecutive entries all showing registry modifications by svchost.exe raises some red flags.\n\nI remember reading about common indicators of compromise (IoCs) in cybersecurity. One of them is unusual or excessive activity related to registry operations, which can indicate that malware is trying to establish persistence or modify system settings. Malware often uses the registry to store configuration information, keys for persistence, or even to drop malicious payloads.\n\nMoreover, since all these events are tied to svchost.exe, it's worth considering whether this process has been given unusual privileges or access. While svchost.exe itself is a legitimate process, if it's being used in an abnormal way, especially with multiple registry modifications quickly in succession, it could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nI also think about how such events would look in typical system logs. Legitimate processes that modify the registry might do so at different times and under different circumstances, but 25 entries in a row seem excessive unless there's a specific reason for it. I can't recall a legitimate scenario where svchost.exe would make this many changes to the registry in quick succession without causing some other noticeable impact on the system.\n\nFurthermore, looking at the 'file' field, all events have \"None\". This might mean that no file was accessed during these registry operations, which could be another red flag. Malware often uses a combination of file operations and registry modifications for persistence and functionality. If there are only registry changes and no files being written or read, it might still indicate malicious activity but perhaps in an early stage.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the timing and frequency. If these events occurred over a short period, that's more concerning than if they were spread out. The batch provided doesn't include timestamps, which would be helpful, but the sheer number suggests a potential issue.\n\nI also think about other possible explanations. Could this be part of a legitimate system update or service restart? It's possible, but again, 25 events in a row seem too much unless there's a specific reason. I'm leaning towards considering these as suspicious because they don't fit the typical pattern of normal system activity.\n\nIn summary, while svchost.exe is a legitimate process, the combination of multiple registry modifications without associated file operations and the high frequency of such events within the same batch is concerning. This could indicate that an attacker is using this process to manipulate system settings or establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple consecutive registry modification events by svchost.exe may indicate potential malicious activity, as excessive registry changes without corresponding file operations can be a sign of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is svchost.exe and the winlog task is about registry changes. Svchost.exe is a common system process, but when it's involved in registry modifications, especially multiple times, it could be suspicious because attackers often use legitimate processes for malicious activities. However, I'm not sure if just registry changes are enough to raise flags here.\n\nThen, there are events where the command line shows powershell.exe being executed with a specific command: New-PSDrive to create a drive mapped to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This is concerning because using PowerShell can be a red flag for malicious activity, especially when it's creating drives that might point to remote locations. The repeated use of this exact command in multiple events makes me think it's part of an attack script or payload.\n\nAdditionally, the winlog tasks vary between RegistryEvent, PipeEvent, and Provider Lifecycle\/Engine Lifecycle. The pipe created event could be a sign of communication between processes, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration. The provider lifecycle events might indicate that PowerShell is being loaded or unloaded, which in itself isn't necessarily bad but combined with the other activities could be suspicious.\n\nI'm also noting that all these events are from the same process tree (svchost.exe and powershell.exe), suggesting a coordinated sequence of actions. This makes me think it's more than just normal system activity; it might be an attack chain where initial access is followed by lateral movement or data theft.\n\nThe number of repeated entries, especially the svchost.exe registry changes and the PowerShell commands, adds to the suspicion. Such repetitive behavior is often seen in scripts trying to establish persistence or perform tasks across multiple systems.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination of registry modifications by svchost.exe followed by specific PowerShell commands suggests a possible malicious campaign. This could indicate an attack like credential dumping, remote access setup, or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry changes and suspicious PowerShell activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, most events show PowerShell executing commands. The initial few have the command line starting with powershell.exe followed by some code. One stands out: \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". That looks like it's trying to map a network drive (G:) pointing to \\Target\\C$, which is a remote volume. This could be an attempt to access another machine, maybe for lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThen there are several events where the command line is just \"powershell.exe & {}\", with empty curly braces. These might be part of the same script execution or initializations before executing more complex commands. The tasks in Windows logs alternate between 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle', which are typical during PowerShell operations, especially when modules are being loaded or drives are created.\n\nLooking further down, some events have a longer command line: checking if \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\" exists. The path seems odd, with multiple backslashes and \"..\", which might be trying to navigate directories incorrectly or access files in unexpected places.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch starts with a suspicious PowerShell command that attempts network drive mapping, followed by repeated checks for a specific file. This combination suggests possible malicious activity, like setting up a persistence mechanism or attempting file operations on remote systems. The repetition of these events could indicate an automated script trying to establish access or perform actions across multiple machines.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this as interesting because it involves potentially harmful PowerShell activities and attempts to access external resources, which are common signs of cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events showing command-line operations attempting network drive mapping and file existence checks suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking at the two JSON objects provided, each represents a process event. The command line in both cases is the same: it's a PowerShell script that checks whether a specific file, \"procdump.exe\", exists in a certain directory. If the file exists, it exits with code 0; otherwise, it exits with code 1.\n\nSo, what stands out here? Well, procdump.exe is a legitimate tool often used for debugging by capturing process dumps. However, its presence or absence could be significant depending on the context. Since the script is checking if this file exists and exiting based on that, it might be part of some automated monitoring or validation step.\n\nNow, considering cybersecurity, sometimes attackers use such checks as part of their lateral movement or to ensure certain tools are present before executing malicious activities. Alternatively, it could just be a benign process like a system check or part of a legitimate script.\n\nThe events don't show any explicit signs of malicious behavior on their ownâ€”no file creation, deletion, or modification, nor any network activity mentioned. They're purely checking for the existence of a file. However, the fact that this check is being performed multiple times (as seen by two identical events) might be worth looking into.\n\nI should also consider the command line's structure. The use of PowerShell with an ampersand suggests it's executing another command, which in this case is the if statement checking for the file. This is a common technique but could be used maliciously as well.\n\nAnother angle is the path where procdump.exe is being checked: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\\". The directory structure seems a bit non-standard, which might not necessarily be bad, but could warrant closer inspection to see if it's part of legitimate operations or if it's a less commonly used location for such tools.\n\nSince both events are identical and there's no indication of any other related activities (like process creation or deletion), the confidence level isn't extremely high. But given that this could be an indicator of potential malicious behavior, especially if procdump.exe is being checked as part of a larger sequence of actions, it might still be worth investigating further.\n\nIn conclusion, while these events aren't definitive proof of something malicious, they do raise enough questions about the intent behind checking for this specific file that it's worth flagging as interesting. The confidence isn't very high but exists because there are potential red flags without clear benign explanations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve a PowerShell script checking the existence of procdump.exe, which could indicate malicious activity such as verifying tool presence before execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
