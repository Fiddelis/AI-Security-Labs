{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. First, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they involve `chrome.exe` with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. These seem normal for a browser process, especially when browsing the internet. No red flags there.\n\nThen, I notice several entries involving `powershell.exe`. This catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The events show various actions: Process accessed, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete logged.\n\nOne event stands out where a file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1` is created and then deleted. This temporary PowerShell script creation and deletion might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test script execution without leaving evidence for long. Additionally, the command line in some events includes a script with commands like `ls -recurse`, which lists files recursively—potentially part of data exfiltration or reconnaissance.\n\nAnother point is multiple ImageLoad tasks from different .dll files related to .NET and Windows Defender. While these are legitimate libraries, frequent loading might indicate some malicious activity trying to blend in with normal processes.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events linked to the same command line suggest ongoing or looping PowerShell operations, which could be part of a script designed to run indefinitely or perform tasks at intervals.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of creating\/deleting a script file, multiple registry accesses, and repeated network-related actions in PowerShell could indicate an attempt at persistence or lateral movement within a network. These activities are common in attack chains, making the batch concerning from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of PowerShell activity including script creation and deletion, which may indicate malicious behavior or attempts to bypass security measures.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with specific command lines. The commands look like they're listing files recursively using ls and get-childitem. That's a bit unusual because such repetitive use of PowerShell might indicate someone is trying to gather information about the system, which could be part of reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most are related to Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle, but some are Image loaded, Pipe Created, File created, Registry value set, and Process accessed. The file paths mentioned include MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which seems legitimate, but there's also a file named objeto_principal.txt being created by powershell.exe. That filename doesn't ring any bells immediately, but it's unusual for a PowerShell script to create files in user directories.\n\nThere are multiple entries where svchost.exe is accessing the registry. Svchost.exe is typically used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware. The fact that it's setting registry values several times might be suspicious. Also, there are events related to user account management and special logon tasks, which could indicate privilege escalation or credential manipulation.\n\nAnother point of interest is the repeated occurrence of powershell.exe commands. Using PowerShell in a loop with such commands can be a red flag because attackers often use it for executing scripts or downloading additional tools. The batch also includes events from winlogbeat.exe creating files, which might just be normal logging activity, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it could raise an eyebrow.\n\nThe process accesses and file creations are spread across different directories, like the user's Downloads and AppData folder. This scattering might be an attempt to stay under the radar or to avoid detection by antivirus software.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events on their own might not be malicious, the combination—repeated PowerShell commands, registry modifications by svchost.exe, file creations with unusual names, and multiple process accesses—suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high because these activities often correlate with attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands to list files recursively across directories, combined with registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe and other processes, may indicate potential malicious activity or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the winlog task is 'User Account Management'. That usually relates to user account creation, deletion, or changes in permissions. However, looking at these events, I don't see any associated files or processes—they just show the logon or logoff events. Without additional context like a high number of failed attempts or unusual times, these might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the data directory. That makes sense because winlogbeat is likely writing its logs or configuration files. The path seems standard, so this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThen I see RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe accessing registry values. RuntimeBroker is a legitimate Windows process used for running Broker services, and Notepad is just an editor. They might be adjusting some settings or preferences, which isn't unusual unless there's a pattern of repeated writes without reason.\n\nPowershell.exe accessed a process, which is concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously. However, in this case, the task is 'ProcessAccess', which could mean it's just querying information about another process—maybe for legitimate script execution. But I'm not sure if that's normal behavior for this system without more context.\n\nCalc.exe and Calculator.exe both loaded urlmon.dll. URL Monitor is a standard Windows DLL used for handling URLs, so it's expected when launching certain applications. The fact that two different calculator processes did this doesn't seem suspicious unless there's an unusual number of instances or odd execution paths.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, most events are normal system activities. There's no indication of failed logins, file creations in unexpected areas, or any signs of malicious code execution. The only potentially concerning point is the PowerShell activity, but without more details on what it did, it's hard to say. Since there's a mix of standard and one possibly elevated action, I'm leaning towards this being interesting because it's worth checking if the PowerShell access was necessary.\n\nI'd rate my confidence as 0.7 because while some events are notable, they don't clearly point to malicious activity on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a combination of user account management activities and process-related events, including the use of PowerShell.exe which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
