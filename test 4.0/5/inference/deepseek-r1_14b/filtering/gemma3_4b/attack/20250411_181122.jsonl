{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. The events seem to be related to process creation and activity on a system, possibly from Windows since I see things like 'whoami.exe' and paths under C:\\Windows.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's the execution of whoami.exe. That seems benign; it's a common tool used to determine user information. But then, looking at the subsequent events, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. The command line in one of them stands out: it has a findstr command searching for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc., and then using select-string with a pattern for \"password\". This immediately raises red flags because this kind of script is often used to search for sensitive information.\n\nLooking deeper into the events, I see that powershell.exe is accessing registry values, which can be part of legitimate operations but also could be malicious if it's trying to gather system information or modify configurations. There are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and others. While these might be normal for running PowerShell scripts, the combination with other actions makes me cautious.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event where a temporary script file is created in C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. Then, immediately after, there's a FileDeleteDetected event for that same file. This seems suspicious because it could indicate an attempt to execute the script and then delete evidence of its existence.\n\nAdditionally, several events show Provider Lifecycle tasks without any associated file, which might mean some kind of communication or activity within the system's services or drivers. But combined with all the PowerShell activities, this adds to the concern.\n\nI also notice that the same command line is repeated multiple times in different events, suggesting perhaps a loop or repeated attempts to execute malicious code. The use of pipes (Pipe Created event) might indicate inter-process communication, which could be part of a larger script or malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several indicators of potential malicious behavior: searching for sensitive information with findstr and select-string, creation and deletion of temporary files, repeated PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines, and multiple registry accesses. While some individual actions might not be alarming on their own, the combination strongly suggests a possible attack or unauthorized access attempt.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple red flags that together point to malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with suspicious patterns searching for sensitive information, combined with temporary file creation and deletion. Indicators include registry access and repeated process creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is telling me.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe with specific command lines. The command line seems to be using findstr and select-string with patterns related to 'pass' in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. That immediately raises a red flag because searching for passwords in files could indicate someone is trying to gather sensitive information. This kind of activity isn't typical unless it's part of legitimate administrative tasks, which still should be monitored closely.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe and other processes like svchost.exe, conhost.exe, etc., are modifying the registry (Registry value set). Registry modifications can be benign, but when combined with other activities like process creation or file access, they might indicate malicious behavior. These events happen several times, which makes me think there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog, I see various types like Process Create, Image Load, File Created, etc. The powershell.exe instances are creating processes and accessing files. For example, one event shows that powershell.exe created a new file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's a bit concerning because it's writing to the user's AppData folder, which is common for persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where findstr.exe is being used with specific search patterns, which aligns with the earlier powershell commands. This combination of using command-line tools for searching and modifying system components suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nI also notice that chrome.exe has several registry writes. While this isn't as suspicious on its own, multiple registry modifications by different processes could be part of a larger campaign to maintain persistence or alter system configurations in ways that are not typical user behavior.\n\nThe fact that these events span across various timestamps and involve multiple processes (powershell.exe, findstr.exe, svchost.exe) working together makes me think this isn't just random noise. It looks like there's a coordinated effort, possibly by an attacker, to search for sensitive information and make changes to the system to either hide their tracks or establish persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell command lines searching for passwords, file creations in user directories, multiple registry writes across different processes—this batch definitely stands out. It's not just a single event; the combination of activities over time is significant. So I would classify this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, searching for sensitive information in files, and creating\/ modifying system files and registry entries, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

While these actions can be part of normal browser behavior, the frequency is high—there are multiple entries with similar tasks. Additionally, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file named 'objeto_logico.txt', which could be suspicious as PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Combining these factors increases my concern.\n\nHowever, most events don't show any overtly malicious behavior beyond what might be expected from Chrome and legitimate system processes. The presence of winlogbeat.exe setting up files seems related to log collection, possibly indicating monitoring rather than an attack. The justification leans towards interesting due to the PowerShell activity and repeated registry writes, but confidence is moderate because other events don't strongly indicate foul play.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry write operations by chrome.exe and a file creation by powershell.exe which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is commonly used for malicious activities because it's powerful and can execute scripts. The commands like 'schtasks' and 'wmic process where name='notepad.exe'' stand out to me. These look like they're trying to delete tasks or processes, which could be an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt system functions.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple instances of creating processes for schtasks.exe and cmd.exe with commands that delete scheduled tasks. This pattern suggests someone is trying to remove scheduled tasks from the system, possibly to cover their tracks or prevent other actions from running.\n\nLooking at the file paths, like 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\estrutura_ativo.txt', it seems a user is downloading files, maybe setting up structures for something. The presence of .winlogbeat.yml.new suggests some monitoring tool might be involved, but more importantly, there's activity with whoami.exe and conhost.exe, which are often used to gather system information or elevate privileges.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the use of RegistryEvent tasks. Malware often manipulates the registry to maintain persistence or hide its presence. The repeated attempts to access and modify processes and the registry could indicate an attacker trying to establish long-term access.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's a mix of process creation, file manipulation, registry changes, and deletion of scheduled tasks. This sequence doesn't look like normal user activity; instead, it resembles someone with malicious intent trying to compromise the system or cover their tracks.\n\nI'm confident enough to say that this batch is interesting because it shows signs of potentially malicious activities, including attempts to delete processes and scheduled tasks, which are common indicators of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and deletions, file operations, and registry modifications, indicative of potential malicious activity such as deleting scheduled tasks and system processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few lines, there's a lot of activity from WMIC.exe. The command line in the first event is \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That seems suspicious because deleting processes via WMI could be malicious. But then I see that it's followed by ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, which are legitimate Windows components. So maybe that's just normal activity.\n\nNext, there are several entries from powershell.exe accessing registry values and being accessed by other processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so this alone isn't enough to raise flags unless the commands themselves are suspicious. But without seeing the actual command lines, it's hard to tell.\n\nNotepad.exe setting a registry value? That seems odd because notepad is just a text editor. Similarly, cmd.exe deleting user accounts via net.exe and net1.exe commands might be part of an automated script or cleanup process, but again, without context, it's unclear.\n\nThere are multiple events where processes like whoami.exe and conhost.exe create new instances and interact with the registry. These tools are often used by attackers for information gathering and persistence.\n\nThe last few events show user account management and security group changes without a corresponding process, which could indicate legitimate admin activity or perhaps privilege escalation attempts.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The repeated use of WMIC.exe to delete processes and the multiple registry accesses by various executables raise some red flags, but not enough evidence to confirm malicious behavior on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations, deletions, and registry modifications involving potentially malicious tools like WMIC.exe, powershell.exe, and cmd.exe indicate possible unauthorized activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of log events to analyze. Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial event, it mentions \"User Account Management\" in winlog. That might be someone creating or modifying user accounts, which could be normal admin activity but could also indicate something malicious like setting up a backdoor account.\n\nNext, there are several events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe with commands that look suspicious. For example, the command line for cmd.exe includes \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". The \"\/del\" flag here is deleting a user account. If this is happening without proper authorization, it could be an attempt to remove traces or disable accounts.\n\nThere are multiple instances of net.exe and net1.exe being used with similar commands, like \"net user pacote_auxiliar_Admin \/del \/domain\". This repetition makes me think that there's a pattern here—maybe the attacker is trying to delete several accounts in a loop or script. The use of both net.exe and net1.exe is unusual; I'm not sure why they're using different executables for the same task.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the deletion of services via sc.exe: \"sc delete win32times\". This could be an attempt to disable monitoring services, which might indicate that someone is trying to cover their tracks or prevent logging.\n\nLooking at the processes created: whoami.exe and conhost.exe. These are often used for information gathering or running other commands in a hidden manner. The repeated use of powershell.exe with registry events makes me think that there's some persistence mechanism being set up, like adding registry keys to run scripts at startup.\n\nThe combination of these activities—deleting user accounts, deleting services, and using various tools—is concerning. It seems like someone is cleaning up after themselves or trying to remove evidence. These actions are not typical day-to-day operations for most users or even all admins; they look more like steps taken during an attack.\n\nSo putting it all together: unauthorized account deletions, service removals, use of multiple scripts and tools—this batch definitely stands out as suspicious. It's likely related to malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletion commands and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

This could be part of normal cleanup, but deleting specific files might indicate something malicious.\n2. **powershell.exe** being accessed and created multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and script operations.\n3. Several events show **Registry value set** actions from cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Malware often modifies the registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n4. A **File Delete logged** event where a specific .exe file is deleted. This might be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities.\n5. Multiple **Provider Lifecycle** and **Engine Lifecycle** events from powershell.exe, which could be related to script execution but also suspicious in large volumes.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern:\n- Repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with specific commands.\n- Registry modifications that could indicate persistence or configuration changes.\n- File deletions targeting potentially malicious files.\n\nThese activities collectively suggest possible malicious behavior. The repeated process creations, registry changes, and file operations, especially using tools like cmd and powershell, are red flags for potential attacks. However, without more context on the baseline activity of these processes, it's hard to be certain, but the combination is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated powershell.exe executions which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, multiple entries show powershell.exe being used. Powershell is a common tool but can also be used maliciously. The first event shows Image loaded for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems suspicious because legitimate processes shouldn't typically load defender components as part of their operation unless there's something wrong.\n\nNext, there are file creation events in temporary directories like C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a specific filename __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. The fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly raises flags because attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious scripts.\n\nAnother event shows a pipe being created in powershell.exe, which could be used for inter-process communication. This might indicate some form of lateral movement or command execution within a process.\n\nLooking further, there are several engine lifecycle events, which are normal for powershell but when combined with other actions, they might suggest something more nefarious. Additionally, there's a process access event on another instance of powershell.exe, possibly indicating one powershell process interacting with another—maybe to inject code or commands.\n\nThere are multiple Process Create events for whoami.exe. While whoami is generally benign, repeated executions without clear reason could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering by an attacker.\n\nThe final few events involve winlogbeat.exe creating files in a specific path. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and isn't inherently malicious, but if it's behaving outside normal parameters, like accessing unusual files or running with elevated privileges, it might warrant attention.\n\nConsidering all these together: repeated powershell activities, creation\/deletion of temp scripts, process creations of potentially benign tools (whoami.exe) that could be used maliciously, and the file operations by winlogbeat. The combination suggests possible malicious behavior. There are several red flags that could indicate an attack chain—perhaps initial access using a script dropped in temp, executed via powershell with persistence mechanisms.\n\nSo overall, the batch does seem relevant for further investigation because of the suspicious activities indicated across multiple events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and repeated process creations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. I'll go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to common processes like whoami.exe, powershell.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, and others. The tasks associated with these processes include things like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image Load, File Create, Dns query, and Network connection detected.\n\nOne thing that catches my eye is the multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. Repeated accesses could be indicative of malicious activity, but it's also commonly used by admins for legitimate tasks. However, combined with other events, this might raise an eyebrow.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe multiple times. While this is typically a benign command to check user information, in some contexts, it can be part of reconnaissance or credential dumping techniques. But again, not inherently malicious unless used inappropriately.\n\nLooking at RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe, these are known to be legitimate Windows processes, often part of system services. However, they've been exploited by malware in the past, so their presence in logs isn't alarming on its own but could be worth monitoring if other suspicious activities coincide.\n\nThe events involving Registry value sets across several processes (like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, Calculator.exe, etc.) might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. Attackers often use the registry to maintain their presence on a system, so repeated writes here could be concerning. However, legitimate software also uses the registry, making it tricky to assess without more context.\n\nThe Image Load events for urlmon.dll in calc.exe and Calculator.exe are interesting. URLMON is a legitimate DLL used for handling URLs, but its use by these processes might be worth investigating. Sometimes, malicious actors inject code into legitimate processes, using components like URLMON for communication or data exfiltration.\n\nFile creation by winlogbeat.exe seems normal if it's an agent collecting logs. However, the path mentioned (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...) suggests it's being used in a user directory, which could be unrelated unless there's more to it.\n\nThe Network connection and Dns query events from chrome.exe are pretty standard and likely part of normal browsing activities. They don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: While there are several events that individually might not raise red flags, the combination could be concerning. The repeated use of powershell.exe, multiple registry writes across different processes, and the image loads in non-standard contexts (like Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll) add up. These patterns might suggest a possible attack where an adversary is using legitimate tools for malicious purposes or establishing persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these are just normal system activities, especially if this system has multiple users or processes running administrative tasks. Without additional context like timestamps, user information, or more detailed file paths, it's hard to be certain. But given the number of potentially concerning events, I'd lean towards classifying this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe access and registry modifications across various processes may indicate potential malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
