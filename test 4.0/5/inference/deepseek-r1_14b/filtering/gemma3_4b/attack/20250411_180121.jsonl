The first few entries are from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries, which seems normal for a browser. But then I see powershell.exe appearing multiple times with different command lines.\n\nThe command lines in the powershell.exe processes stand out because they involve downloading files from various GitHub repositories into temporary locations. Specifically, each command is using WebClient to download a file and saving it to %env:TEMP%. This behavior is concerning because it's indicative of script execution or potential malicious activities.\n\nMoreover, there are events where a file is created and then deleted shortly after. The creation and deletion of files in the Temp directory without clear justification could be part of an attempt to avoid detection or to execute code temporarily.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated pattern in the command lines, each downloading from different repositories but following a similar structure. This repetition suggests automated or script-based activity, which might be malicious in nature.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of powershell.exe for downloading files, the temporary file operations, and the repetitive behavior—it's highly likely that this batch is relevant for further investigation.

Each command is slightly different but follows the same pattern: using powershell.exe to execute a script that downloads a file from a GitHub URL into the TEMP directory. This is concerning because it looks like a common tactic for malicious scripts to download additional payloads or tools.\n\nAlso, there are several events where PowerShell is creating files in specific paths, like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and others. These activities could be part of establishing persistence or dropping malicious files on the system.\n\nAnother point of interest is the number of registry value sets by both Chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome might have legitimate reasons to modify the registry, multiple such events without any other context could indicate suspicious activity, especially when combined with the other PowerShell behavior.\n\nThere are also a few DNS query events. These alone aren't unusual, but they might be part of an attempt to communicate with external servers or check for domain availability, which can sometimes be part of malicious activities.\n\nOne event shows Chrome.exe making multiple Registry changes, which doesn't align with typical user activity and could be an indicator of compromise if it's not expected behavior.\n\nLastly, the winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of legitimate log management, but it's worth noting as it could also be used in data exfiltration or logging malicious activities.\n\nPutting all these together—multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, suspicious file creations, numerous registry modifications, and some unexpected Chrome activity—it seems like this batch shows signs of potential malicious behavior.

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with details about the process, Windows log task, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events from different processes like powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and others. Powershell is often used for malicious activities because it's versatile and can execute commands, so that catches my attention.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there are several 'Registry value set' events. That makes me think someone might be trying to hide their tracks or modify system configurations, which could be part of an attack. There's also a process creation event for whoami.exe, which is typically used to get user information—maybe reconnaissance?\n\nI see commands like \"cmd.exe \/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1\". This looks suspicious because it's deleting a scheduled task named 'spawn'. If an attacker wants persistence, they might create their own tasks and delete existing ones to avoid detection. The use of redirection (\">nul 2>&1\") suggests they're trying to suppress output to avoid alerts.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated access to urlmon.dll via processes like Calculator.exe and calc.exe. This DLL is part of URL handling, but unexpected accesses can indicate attempts to inject code or manipulate network traffic.\n\nThere's also an event where a file named 'entrada_base.txt' was created by powershell.exe. Creating files in user directories might be part of data exfiltration or setting up a base for further actions.\n\nWhile there are legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and schtasks.exe, the combination of these events—using powershell, modifying registry entries, deleting scheduled tasks, accessing system DLLs, and creating files—is concerning. It looks like someone might be trying to establish persistence, hide their activities, or perform malicious operations on the system.\n\nSo overall, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because of multiple indicators that point towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe process creations and deletions of scheduled tasks, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the process names: conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe—all are legitimate system tools. The tasks involve things like registry changes and process creation. I don't immediately spot any red flags here, but the repeated use of PowerShell might be worth noting since it's often used in scripting and can be a vector for attacks.\n\nI notice several events where PowerShell is being accessed or creating processes. For example, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing something with 'ProcessAccess' and also setting registry values. The command lines seem standard, but the sheer number of times PowerShell is used could be significant.\n\nThere's an event where cmd.exe runs a REG DELETE command to remove a registry entry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This suggests someone is trying to delete an autorun entry, possibly cleaning up after some malicious activity or just regular maintenance. But it's hard to tell without context.\n\nAnother event shows reg.exe being used to delete another registry entry. Again, legitimate administrative tasks could involve this, but if done repeatedly or in conjunction with other activities, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the last few events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is run with an empty command line and the task is 'Provider Lifecycle'. This seems odd because usually, PowerShell commands would have some arguments. Empty command lines might indicate that the script isn't executing anything visible or is trying to hide its actions.\n\nPutting it all together: several legitimate tools being used, but the repetition of certain activities—especially with PowerShell—and the empty command line executions raise some questions. Could this be a persistence mechanism where malicious actors are setting up scripts to run at startup? Or maybe they're attempting to remove traces of their activity by deleting registry entries.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.7 because while the individual actions aren't necessarily malicious, the combination and frequency might suggest something more than routine system administration. Without more context, it's hard to be certain, but there are enough indicators to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of legitimate tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe showing repeated registry modifications and process creations could indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or cleanup attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events are related to PowerShell.exe. Specifically, there are multiple entries where the process is PowerShell and the task involves loading images or creating files. For example, the first few entries show ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs. This could be normal because PowerShell often loads different libraries when running scripts, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nLooking further, I see that there are events where a file was created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script name: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1\". Then immediately after, the same file is deleted. This pattern of creating and then deleting a temporary script might be part of some automated process or testing, but it could also indicate an attempt to execute malicious code that's removed quickly to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point of interest is the use of cmd.exe with a command line \"\/c\", which usually means executing a command and then terminating. This could be innocent, like running a script, but in some cases, it might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere are also events involving Registry value sets by both PowerShell.exe and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can be legitimate for configuration changes, but it's another area where malicious actors might try to persistence or alter system settings.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe was executed. While this is commonly used for legitimate purposes like checking user permissions, it could also be part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack to gather information about the system.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell activities, creation and deletion of a script file, command-line execution with cmd, registry modifications, and use of whoami.exe. These are all flags that might indicate suspicious behavior. However, each individually could also be part of normal operations, especially since the user is running some scripts or tools.\n\nThe high number of events tied to PowerShell and the specific actions like creating\/deleting a script file, along with other system calls, increase the suspicion. While it's possible these are from legitimate activities (like testing or configuration), the combination raises the risk that something malicious is occurring.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is an actual attack, but the pattern does show some red flags. My confidence isn't 100%, maybe around 75-80%, because while each action could be innocent, together they suggest potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, command-line execution with cmd.exe, and registry modifications raise suspicion of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two cmd.exe and conhost.exe processes setting registry values. That might be normal admin activity but could also indicate something malicious. Then, multiple powershell.exe instances accessing processes and modifying the registry. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and attacks, so repeated access events could be red flags.\n\nI notice several ImageLoad tasks in powershell.exe, which means it's loading various DLLs. This can be part of normal operation, but sometimes attackers use these to inject malicious code or load malicious libraries. The file creation and deletion in the Temp directory is concerning because it suggests script execution; creating and then deleting a script file might be an attempt to bypass some policy logging.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with \"& {}\" as command line arguments. This can be used to hide commands or inject code, which is often seen in attacks. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events from powershell might indicate it's being used for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple registry modifications, process access, image loading, file creation\/deletion, and hidden command execution—it seems like a coordinated effort that could be malicious.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is something I should look into. Okay, so I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these together and decide whether they're interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to see what's happening. The events seem to be related to process creations, registry changes, file operations, and some network activities maybe?\n\nLooking at the first few lines: Calculator.exe running is normal, but then there are multiple entries from powershell.exe doing different things. For example, creating pipes, accessing processes, setting registry values. I know that PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nThere are several instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines like \"& {}\", which doesn't look very standard. That might mean they're executing some scripts or commands in a way that's not typical, possibly to hide something or execute malicious code. Also, I notice some events where files are created or accessed, like the file paths mentioned. One of them is MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender, so that seems okay. But another one is creating a profile data file in the Startup folder, which might be suspicious.\n\nThen there's an event from whoami.exe being executed. That's usually used to get user information, which could be part of reconnaissance but isn't inherently malicious unless it's done with other actions.\n\nI also see a lot of registry writes by various processes, including Chrome and Calculator. While some applications do modify the registry during normal operation, multiple writes in quick succession or from different processes might indicate something is off. Especially if they're setting values that shouldn't be there or modifying system settings without user interaction.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated attempts to access other processes (ProcessAccess events). This could be a sign of process injection or privilege escalation techniques where an application tries to gain higher-level permissions by accessing another process's memory space.\n\nThere are also file creation events. The fact that some files are being created in the TEMP directory, like objeo_principal.zip, which doesn't look like a standard system file name. Creating files in temp directories can be part of normal operations, but deleting them might indicate an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe is known for its dual use—legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The combination of process creations with unusual command lines, multiple registry writes from different processes, file accesses in non-standard locations, and attempts to access other processes suggests potential malicious behavior. This could be an indicator of a script or tool being executed that's trying to hide itself or perform actions that aren't intended by the user.\n\nI'm not 100% certain without more context, but based on these events, it seems like there might be something worth investigating. So I'll classify this as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell executions with unusual command lines, repeated registry modifications, and file operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities due to its built-in capabilities and the ability to execute commands directly. \n\nLooking at each event, there are multiple instances where files are being loaded into memory or created\/deleted in temporary directories. For example, several entries show file creations and deletions in the TEMP folder with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. This seems suspicious because creating a script in the temp directory and then deleting it could be an attempt to avoid detection or clean up after malicious activity.\n\nAnother point of concern is the repeated use of Remove-Item cmdlets in PowerShell scripts. These commands are used to delete files, and when combined with the -ErrorAction Ignore parameter, it means any errors during deletion won't be logged or displayed, which is a common tactic to cover tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where known legitimate processes like chrome.exe load modules related to antivirus (MpOAV.dll) and other system components. While this isn't inherently malicious, the combination of these with PowerShell activities could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures or load malicious code undetected.\n\nThe logs also show multiple ImageLoad events for various .dll files associated with .NET and Windows Defender. Although these are standard system files, their loading in conjunction with other suspicious activities might suggest that a malicious script is trying to utilize these legitimate modules to execute its payload.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that many of these events are chained together—creating a file, deleting it, loading certain libraries—suggests a potential script or process that's trying to execute without leaving too much trace. This kind of behavior is often seen in attack chains where adversaries try to maintain persistence or carry out their objectives stealthily.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch as a whole does show signs of potentially malicious activities, particularly around file operations and PowerShell usage. However, it's possible that some of this activity could also be from legitimate scripts or normal operations. The high volume of similar events, especially the repeated deletions in the TEMP directory and the command-line arguments used, leans towards something more suspicious.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while not conclusive on its own, it does present several red flags that would merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events showing file creation and deletion in TEMP directory, along with repeated attempts to remove files using Remove-Item cmdlets.

This sequence might indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts or test system policies. The combination of creating and then deleting files is a common tactic in attacks to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nThe events also involve registry modifications and process accesses, which are often used by malware to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.

Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes running with command lines that remove files from the TEMP directory. These commands are using Remove-Item and have ErrorAction set to Ignore, which is common in scripts to avoid output. But the fact that they're deleting specific files like 'registro_auxiliar.txt' and others seems a bit unusual. I wonder if these deletions are part of normal cleanup or something more malicious.\n\nThen there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is often used for log shipping, so this isn't too suspicious on its own. However, the path mentioned is specific, and it's good to note that this process is running as expected.\n\nNext, I see multiple instances of powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal because Defender might use PowerShell scripts to scan or update. But combined with other events, it could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, there are several FileCreate and RegistryEvent tasks by both PowerShell and Chrome. The repeated Registry value sets by Chrome are a bit odd but not necessarily bad—maybe an extension or update is causing that. However, the number of such events might indicate something more persistent or unwanted.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe runs without any command-line arguments. Whoami is typically harmless, used to get user information, so unless it's part of a larger attack chain, this isn't concerning on its own.\n\nAnother point is the ProcessAccess tasks by PowerShell and RuntimeBroker. These could be normal for legitimate processes accessing other services or files, but again, without more context, they're hard to judge.\n\nPutting all these together, I'm concerned about the repeated deletions in TEMP by PowerShell. Malware often deletes traces of its activity there. Also, the multiple Registry changes from various processes might indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. The use of ErrorAction Ignore is another red flag because it's a common technique to suppress errors and avoid detection.\n\nWhile individual events aren't alarming, the combination—especially the PowerShell deletions and frequent registry modifications—is suggestive of potential malicious activity.

Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The fact that it's accessing processes repeatedly might raise some flags, especially if we don't see other related activity to balance it out.\n\nThen there are instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is typically benign as it's used to check user permissions. However, seeing it multiple times could indicate something if combined with other suspicious activities. But in this batch, they're standalone.\n\nLooking at the file paths, I notice that winlogbeat.exe created a configuration file, which makes sense if it's an agent running. The powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt is a bit odd; \"pacote\" might relate to Portuguese for package or active. Not sure about its context here.\n\nThe repetition of powershell.exe accessing processes might indicate someone trying different things or maybe automated scripts.
