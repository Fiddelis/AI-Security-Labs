Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of entries where the process is 'whoami.exe' being created. That seems normal because whoami is a standard system tool used to get user information. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I notice multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and created. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to look at. The command line in one of the events shows it executing a script from a GitHub URL: https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn... That catches my eye because downloading scripts directly from the internet can be risky, especially if they're executed immediately.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe is accessing various registry values and loading different image files. While PowerShell does load many DLLs when running scripts, the combination of multiple ImageLoad events and a direct execution of an external script might indicate something malicious. Also, there's a file being created and then deleted in the same location: C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp... This temporary file deletion could be part of a script trying to clean up its traces.\n\nAnother point is that after executing the script, other processes like sppsvc.exe are involved. I'm not sure what's normal for that process, but combined with the powershell activity, it might suggest some kind of persistence or lateral movement.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple Registry value sets in powershell.exe could be setting up persistence mechanisms, like adding registry entries to run at startup. Also, creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder suggests an attempt to maintain persistence across user sessions.\n\nConsidering all these events together—executing external scripts, accessing registries, loading images, and creating\/deleting files—it's possible that this batch shows signs of malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some actions could be legitimate, but the combination points towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts from an external source, accessing registry values, and creating\/deleting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process name is 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement because it has built-in administrative capabilities and can execute code directly on the system. The fact that it's appearing several times could be significant.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks associated with these events:\n- There are multiple instances of 'Process Create' and 'Registry value set'. Registry modifications are often a red flag because attackers might try to persistence by creating or modifying registry keys.\n- A file was created in the Temporary folder: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1'. The fact that it's a PowerShell script (as indicated by .ps1 extension) and in a temporary directory is concerning. This could be part of malicious activity, such as testing script execution or dropping malware.\n- There's also a 'File Delete logged' event for the same file, which suggests that after creating it, the file was deleted. This behavior might indicate an attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Image Load events showing different DLLs being loaded by PowerShell. While this is normal for legitimate script execution, the combination with other suspicious activities could raise concerns about malicious code being executed.\n\nOther processes like 'svchost.exe', 'sppsvc.exe', and 'whoami.exe' appear in the logs as well. Svchost is a common process that can be part of legitimate system services or used by malware. Sppsvc.exe relates to Software Protection, which could be benign but sometimes targeted by exploits. The use of whoami.exe, while not inherently malicious, could be part of gathering system information during an attack.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances with file creation\/deletion, registry changes, and loading various DLLs—along with other process activities—indicates potential malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe including file creation, deletion, and registry modifications suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all have a similar command line. The process is using powershell.exe with some inline code that downloads a script from a GitHub repository. The URL mentioned is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn...\" which I think might be related to known malicious scripts. WinPwn is a tool I've heard about before; it's used for lateral movement and privilege escalation in Windows environments, often by attackers.\n\nThe command being executed includes 'iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)' which means they're executing code downloaded from that URL. The script name is WinPwn.ps1, which aligns with the tool I was thinking about. So this looks like an attempt to execute a known malicious payload.\n\nAdditionally, the arguments after downloading are '-noninteractive -consoleoutput', which suggests that it's running without user interaction and outputting to the console. This is typical of scripts that need to run unattended, possibly for persistence or automated attacks.\n\nThe 'winlog' field shows tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These seem related to how Windows handles providers and services, so maybe this script is trying to establish some kind of service or persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking further down the events, there are some variations. Some command lines are using 'New-PSDrive' with parameters that look like they're mapping a drive to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". This seems suspicious because it's attempting to access another machine's C drive, likely over the network. This is a common technique used in penetration testing and attacks for lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe repetition of these commands across multiple events suggests that there might be multiple attempts or possibly different stages of an attack. The same script might be executed several times, maybe trying different targets or methods to ensure successful execution.\n\nConsidering all this, the activities described fit common indicators of compromise (IOC) for cyberattacks. The use of known malicious scripts like WinPwn and network drive mappings to remote machines are red flags. These could indicate an ongoing attack where an attacker is trying to move laterally within a network or escalate privileges.\n\nTherefore, these events should be considered significant because they demonstrate potentially harmful activities that could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed contains multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity indicative of potential malicious behavior. The repeated execution of the WinPwn.ps1 script from a known repository often associated with cyberattacks suggests an attempt to compromise systems. Additionally, the use of network drive mappings points to lateral movement within a network, a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs). Given these findings, the events are classified as **interesting** due to their alignment with attack patterns and potential security risks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"Interesting\",\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"malicious_script_execution\": {\n      \"description\": \"Multiple executions of a known malicious script (WinPwn.ps1) from a GitHub repository associated with cyberattacks.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"Command line indicates downloading and executing the script using powershell.exe.\",\n        \"URL matches a known repository for malicious tools used in attacks.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"network_lateral_movement\": {\n      \"description\": \"Use of 'New-PSDrive' to map network drives, potentially accessing remote machines (e.g., \\\\Target\\\\C$).\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"Command line shows attempts to connect to remote drives, indicating possible lateral movement within a network.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"repeated_attempts\": {\n      \"description\": \"Repetition of similar commands across multiple events suggests persistent attack attempts or multi-stage activities.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"Multiple events with the same command patterns, possibly targeting different machines or executing different parts of an attack.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of 20 JSONL events. Each event has the same structure: process is None, winlog indicates a task named \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and file is also None. My job is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these events represent. The presence of multiple events with the same 'task' in the Windows event log suggests repeated attempts to execute remote commands. Since each event has no associated process or file information, it's a bit ambiguous where exactly this activity is coming from.\n\nI remember that \"Execute Remote Command\" tasks are often related to legitimate administrative activities, such as running scripts or commands over Remote Desktop or via tools like PowerShell. However, in the context of cybersecurity, repeated attempts without any other indicators could be suspicious. It might indicate an attempt at command and control communication or unauthorized access.\n\nConsidering there are 20 identical events, this repetition raises my concern. Usually, legitimate activities wouldn't generate so many identical log entries unless it's part of a script running multiple times. But I don't have enough context here to know if that's the case. The absence of other fields like process name or file path leaves me without additional clues about the origin or intent.\n\nOn one hand, each individual event might not be alarming, but collectively, they could signal a potential breach attempt. Attackers often use remote command execution for lateral movement or to execute malicious code. The lack of associated files or processes makes it hard to link these events directly to known malware, which lowers the confidence level slightly.\n\nI'm also thinking about false positives. Maybe this is part of a legitimate process that's being logged multiple times without any nefarious intent. But given the number of events and the specific task name, I can't rule out malicious activity entirely.\n\nIn terms of classification, since there are multiple identical events with a task that could be either benign or malicious depending on context, it leans towards \"INTERESTING.\" The confidence isn't very high because without more information, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. So, maybe around 0.6 or 0.7.\n\nTo summarize: the batch is interesting due to multiple repeated remote command executions but lacks enough context for a higher confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events indicating repeated attempts to execute remote commands, which could be suspicious or indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
