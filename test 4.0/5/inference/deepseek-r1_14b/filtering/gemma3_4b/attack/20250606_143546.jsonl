{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and decide whether it's interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities. The first event shows that powershell.exe accessed something, then there are multiple instances of it accessing resources again. That's a bit concerning because repeated accesses could indicate testing or enumeration.\n\nNext, I notice a command line in one of the events: \"powershell.exe\" followed by some PowerShell script. The path in the command line is pointing to 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That's interesting because the path structure with multiple dots (..) might be trying to navigate to a different directory, possibly to hide where the script is actually located. This kind of behavior could be an attempt to obfuscate the source of the script.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is loading various image files and modules, like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET libraries, the combination with other actions might raise a red flag.\n\nThen, I see a file being created in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1'. That's a suspicious filename because it includes 'PSScriptPolicy' which relates to PowerShell scripting policies. Creating such a file could be part of testing or bypassing script execution policies, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAfter that, the same file is deleted. The creation and deletion within a short time might suggest an attempt to execute the script without leaving it on disk for too long, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also pipe creations by powershell.exe, which could be used for inter-process communication, maybe with other malicious processes or for exfiltration.\n\nAnother event involves svchost.exe creating a log file and modifying registry values. SvcHost is often associated with legitimate services, but it can sometimes be used by malware to hide processes. The creation of 'edbtmp.log' in the SoftwareDistribution directory could indicate something related to Windows Update or servicing stack activities, but without more context, it's hard to say. The registry modification might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting all this together, I'm noticing a pattern where powershell.exe is being used with potentially malicious scripts, creating temporary files, deleting them quickly, and possibly interacting with system services (svchost.exe). These activities could be indicative of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence within a network. The use of obfuscated paths and temporary script execution adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm not seeing any direct evidence of malicious payload execution, but the behavior is concerning enough that it warrants further investigation. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some actions could be benign, but the combination points towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines and file operations, including creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script.

Let's break down each event.\n\nFirst, I see several processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe performing registry value sets. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations but could also indicate malicious activity, especially when done by non-standard processes.\n\nThere are events where powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. Powershell is commonly used for both benign and malicious tasks, so this might warrant closer inspection.\n\nMultiple instances of svchost.exe creating files under C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download... This looks suspicious because svchost is often associated with legitimate services but can be hijacked by malware. The paths here seem unusual and not part of normal Windows operations.\n\nOther events involve image loads for urlmon.dll, which is a known DLL used in Windows updates. Seeing this being loaded by various processes could be normal, but combined with the other activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nOverall, there's a pattern of multiple system-related processes creating files and modifying registry entries in non-standard locations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of system log events where the process is consistently svchost.exe. That's a common Windows process, often associated with services running under System account. Now, most of these events are registry value sets and file creations.\n\nFirst, multiple RegistryEvent tasks by svchost.exe might be normal since it's used by various legitimate processes to modify the registry. But I should check if these modifications are out of the ordinary or if they're happening too frequently. Also, the files being created are in standard Windows directories like SoftwareDistribution and Logs. Those paths are typical for updates and system operations.\n\nI notice some file creation events pointing to specific .etl files and temporary logs. These could be part of normal Windows update processes or diagnostic logging. The presence of multiple similar events might indicate repetitive tasks, which isn't necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of events—many repeated RegistryEvent writes and FileCreate operations—could be a red flag if they exceed what's typical for the system. If svchost.exe is performing these actions excessively, it might suggest a background process or potential malicious activity trying to stay under the radar by using a legitimate process.\n\nBut without more context about the baseline of this system, it's hard to say definitively. The events don't show any unusual file paths or access patterns that are commonly associated with malware. They seem to align with standard Windows operations, possibly related to update services or system maintenance.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a slight concern due to the volume and repetitive nature of these events, they don't clearly indicate malicious behavior. It might just be normal system activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of svchost.exe performing registry modifications and file creation operations in standard Windows directories, which are typical for legitimate system processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first three lines are all from svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process. It seems like it's setting registry values and creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That sounds normal because svchost often handles system services, including updates and patches. The file paths mentioned look like standard locations for update-related files.\n\nNext, there are several events from MpSigStub.exe, which I know is related to Windows Defender. It's loading DLLs and creating pipes, which fits its role as a stub that handles signature updates. Creating temp files with names like mpasdlta.vdm seems typical for Defender's operations—nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen, setup.exe appears multiple times. This is often used during software installations or updates. The paths it's accessing are within the EdgeCore directory, which makes sense if Microsoft Edge is being updated. These actions are standard for setup processes.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe and powershell.exe also show up briefly. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows' User Account Control and resource management, so its activity is normal. Powershell.exe can be tricky since it's used both benignly and maliciously, but in this case, there's no indication of suspicious commands or elevated privileges; just a process access event.\n\nLooking at all these events together, the activities are consistent with regular system operations—updating defender signatures, handling patches, installing software components. There's nothing out of place that would indicate malicious behavior like unexpected file creations, registry modifications in sensitive areas, or signs of privilege escalation. No network connections or unusual process spawns either.\n\nI'm confident that this batch doesn't show any signs of malicious activity. It's just the system doing its normal updates and maintenance.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal system operations, including file creation and registry modifications by legitimate processes such as svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, and setup.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. First, I notice that a lot of these entries are from PowerShell and services.exe accessing the registry and creating processes.\n\nLooking at each event, there's a whoami.exe running, which is usually harmless, but then powershell.exe shows up multiple times with different tasks. One of them has a command line that looks suspicious—it's trying to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path that ends in .exe. That stands out because creating services can be a way for malware to persist across reboots.\n\nAlso, the powershell.exe process is accessing various files and registry keys repeatedly. There's a file creation and deletion of a temp script, which might indicate that something malicious is being written and then deleted to cover tracks. The use of multiple image loads suggests it's loading several components or modules, possibly for obfuscation or to hide its activities.\n\nThe services.exe process making several registry changes also catches my eye. Malware often uses legitimate tools like services.exe to make system changes stealthily. Multiple registry writes could be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations to allow unauthorized access.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show signs of potentially malicious activity—suspicious service creation, file operations in temp directories, and repeated registry modifications. The combination points towards possible exploitation or persistence techniques commonly used by attackers.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes creating a new service with suspicious parameters and accessing various files and registry entries, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. The user mentioned that I should analyze the entire batch as a whole, so I need to look for patterns or combinations that might indicate something malicious.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first few logs show processes named \"tarefa_logico.exe\" loading various DLLs. These seem like normal operations because applications often load standard libraries. The files being loaded are mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll—all of these are related to the .NET framework, which is legitimate.\n\nThen, there's an event involving \"powershell.exe\" creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell activities can be normal or malicious, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, another log shows \"powershell.exe\" setting a registry value. That's something to note because changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThen there are events where the process is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and the file path points to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1.\" This script seems to be executed remotely. The fact that it's being run via PowerShell could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, several events have the same command line for powershell.exe, which is executing a script from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1.\" This repeated command line suggests that the script might be running multiple times or in different contexts. The script is trying to invoke something called \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" and has error handling, which could indicate it's part of a larger script or malicious payload.\n\nThe tasks associated with these events are either \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which don't immediately ring alarm bells but might be related to how PowerShell initializes modules or handles commands.\n\nPutting this together: there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is running scripts that reference the same file path, and some of these scripts have attempts to execute code with error handling. The repeated execution and the specific script name make me think this could be part of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to run malicious code.\n\nThe initial events loading .NET DLLs by \"tarefa_logico.exe\" seem normal, but when combined with the PowerShell activities, it's possible that this is all part of a coordinated attack. Malware might use legitimate processes and tools like PowerShell to execute scripts from specific locations, especially if those locations are not commonly accessed or if they're being written to.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same script execution could indicate an attempt to ensure the script runs despite interruptions, which is a common tactic in attacks. The use of error handling and sleep commands (like Start-Sleep 5) might be part of a larger script designed to evade detection or wait before executing malicious actions.\n\nIn summary, while individual events don't necessarily look suspicious, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions targeting specific scripts and file operations suggests potential malicious activity that could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing a script from C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 70\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that each event has three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process field seems to be about command lines executed, winlog is related to Windows log tasks, and file points to a path or is None.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there's a pattern where powershell.exe is being used with some command-line arguments. Specifically, in the first event, it's importing a module from \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\" and then invoking a function called Invoke-entrada_principal. That seems a bit unusual because I'm not familiar with that specific PowerShell command or module name.\n\nThen, in the subsequent events, there are multiple instances of creating a new service using New-Service with the same parameters each time. The service is named \"objeto_ativo\" and points to an executable in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating the same service multiple times might be a sign of something being set up or perhaps an attempt to ensure it's running, which could be malicious.\n\nLooking further down, there are events where process is None but the file points to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The winlog task here is \"Execute a Remote Command\", which suggests that this script might be being executed remotely. That's concerning because remote execution can be used for malicious purposes, like executing scripts without user interaction.\n\nThe repetition of these events multiple times (like seven times for the service creation and several times for the remote command) makes me think there's some automation or script running in a loop. Such repetitive behavior could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures by trying multiple times or distributing activities across different logs.\n\nI'm also considering whether these paths are legitimate. The path structure \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\" and its subdirectories don't seem like standard Windows directories, which might make them suspicious. Malware often uses such non-standard paths to hide their files and processes.\n\nPutting it all together: the use of PowerShell to execute unknown scripts, creating multiple services with potentially malicious names and paths, coupled with remote command execution. These are red flags that could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or service installation for a potential backdoor.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of these events suggests possible malicious behavior. The confidence isn't 100% but based on the indicators, it's high enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions and service creations point to potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. Let me analyze them one by one to see if there's anything interesting or concerning.\n\nFirst, most of the events have \"winlog\" task as \"Execute a Remote Command\". That seems repetitive. The file path mentioned is the same each time: 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. This could be a script being executed remotely, which might indicate some automated process or perhaps malicious activity.\n\nThere are also a couple of events where \"process\" is 'services.exe' with task 'Logon', and one event with 'Special Logon'. I know that services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, often related to service management. The logon tasks could be normal user logins, but the frequency here isn't too high.\n\nThe file path seems suspicious because it's the same across multiple events. If this script is executing repeatedly, it might be part of a larger campaign or a persistence mechanism used by attackers. The repetition could suggest that an attacker is trying to maintain access or perform tasks on the system.\n\nI also notice that there are no other file accesses or process creations mentioned in these logs beyond what's provided. This makes me wonder if there's more context needed, but based on what I have, the repeated remote command execution of the same script raises a red flag.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch as a whole shows multiple attempts to execute the same remote command, which could be indicative of malicious activity or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of the same script file, indicating potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The repeated execution of the same script could be suspicious, possibly part of malicious activity like script-based attacks or persistence mechanisms. However, it's also possible that legitimate system tasks are triggering these commands multiple times.\n\nSince there are 18 events, including a few from Windows Update Agent, it adds some variety but not enough to change the overall pattern.
