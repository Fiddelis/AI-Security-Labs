{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is being accessed. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement and execution of malicious scripts. The fact that it's accessed several times in different events suggests possible command and control activities or attempts to execute commands.\n\nThen there are instances where cmd.exe and reg.exe are used with command lines adding registry entries. Specifically, they're modifying the Run key under HKCU. This is concerning because adding entries to the Run key can allow malicious software to persist across reboots, which is a common tactic in persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the files being created, there's a file named modulo_padrao.txt created by PowerShell.exe and another .winlogbeat.yml.new file from winlogbeat.exe. While winlogbeat might be legitimate for log shipping, the presence of these files alongside the other suspicious activities could indicate that data is being exfiltrated or configurations are being set up to maintain access.\n\nThe combination of multiple registry changes, process creations for tools like PowerShell and cmd, and file creation events all point towards potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is setting up a persistence mechanism by adding entries to the Run key, using these tools to execute commands, and possibly creating files as part of their payload or for data storage.\n\nGiven all these factors, it seems like there are several red flags that together make this batch of events worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe accessing registry and file system, which may indicate malicious activity such as persistence or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
