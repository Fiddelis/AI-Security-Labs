Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with some command-line arguments. The command lines look like they're creating scheduled tasks. Specifically, each command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a common calculator executable but can be malicious if dropped by another process.\n\nThe tasks are being registered with names like 'unidade_ativo', 'registro_geral', etc. The fact that these are all named differently suggests maybe an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, possibly to persist across reboots or to avoid detection by having different task names.\n\nAlso, the command lines specify the trigger as AtLogon, meaning these tasks will run at user logon. This is a common persistence mechanism for malware because it allows the malicious payload (calc.exe in this case) to execute automatically when a user logs in.\n\nThe 'User' part of the scheduled task setup specifies BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel set to Highest. That means the task runs with high privileges, which could be dangerous if the intent is malicious since it can perform actions that require admin rights.\n\nNow, looking at other events: there are some Registry value sets and Process accesses related to powershell.exe, which aligns with creating scheduled tasks as registry modifications are often involved in such operations. There's also an event where mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are loaded by powershell.exe. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's a chrome.exe process accessing a pipe and modifying the registry too, but since it's Chrome, that's more expected behavior unless there's something unusual about it, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell.exe instances creating scheduled tasks at logon with admin privileges. This could indicate a potential attempt at persistence or lateral movement within the system. The repeated use of powershell for such tasks is a red flag because attackers often abuse legitimate tools like PowerShell for their activities.\n\nI'm also noticing that each task registration has a slightly different name, which might be an attempt to evade detection by security tools that block specific task names. Additionally, using calc.exe as the payload could be a way to test if the system allows such tasks or to deliver more malicious payloads later.\n\nConsidering all these points, this batch of events shows behavior that's potentially malicious. The combination of creating multiple high-privilege scheduled tasks and the use of powershell.exe for task creation is indicative of possible attacker activity aiming to maintain persistence on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as payload at user logon, running under high privileges.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's break down this problem. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The classification needs to be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most are related to PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs and creating temporary files. For example, there's a file creation of \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1\" in the user's temp directory. Then it's deleted right after. This seems like part of script execution checks by Windows.\n\nNext, there are several registry writes from chrome.exe. These might be normal updates or tracking, but they don't immediately raise red flags unless known malicious activity is linked to them.\n\nThe standout events are the ones where the process name is 'None' with tasks labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This catches my attention because it's unusual for an event not to have a process name. It suggests either a misconfigured log source, a hidden or terminated process, or potentially something malicious trying to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's a PowerShell command line that schedules a task to run calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. While calc is benign, the method of scheduling tasks using administrative access could be a sign of persistence techniques used by attackers.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple events without process names and suspicious scheduled task execution point towards possible malicious activity or at least something out of the ordinary that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, which is unusual. Additionally, there are PowerShell activities that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This seems suspicious because executing remote commands can be a common tactic in cyberattacks, like command-line attacks, which often indicate malicious activity. However, without additional context, it's hard to tell if these are legitimate or part of an attack.\n\nThen, I see events involving PowerShell execution and scheduled tasks. For example, there's a process where powershell.exe is used with a command that creates a new scheduled task. The command line shows the creation of \"unidade_comum\", which translates to something like \"common unit\" in Portuguese—this might be an attempt to create a malicious scheduled task to execute calc.exe at logon as an administrator. That definitely raises red flags because it's giving elevated privileges and persistence.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries where svchost.exe interacts with the registry, creating new keys or values. SvcHost is commonly used by malware for hiding processes or establishing persistence. The creation of a scheduled task named \"unidade_comum\" seems like a key part of this activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where conhost.exe and chrome.exe are interacting with the registry. While Chrome is a legitimate application, unusual registry access can indicate tampering, especially if it's done by another process or in combination with other suspicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The file paths seem normal at first glance, but paired with the other activities, they might be part of a larger malicious payload deployment.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a sequence of actions that suggest possible malicious behavior: creating scheduled tasks for persistence, using elevated privileges, and multiple processes modifying system configurations. These indicators collectively point towards potential compromise or attack activity.\n\nTherefore, the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation because the combination of remote command executions, powershell activities, registry modifications, and file creations all together create a concerning pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including remote command execution, PowerShell activity creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. I'm looking at a batch of JSONL events provided by the user. My goal is to determine if this batch is relevant for investigation. The user mentioned they're a cybersecurity expert with experience in analyzing logs, so they likely want an accurate assessment without any unnecessary details.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first eight events all involve the process \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values. Registry modifications can be common, especially for legitimate software updates or configurations. However, repeated registry writes might indicate something suspicious, but since it's from Chrome, which is a well-known application, this could just be normal behavior.\n\nThen, there are two more events: one from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file and another from \"powershell.exe\" also creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so its activity might not raise red flags immediately. However, PowerShell is often associated with both legitimate scripting and malicious activities because it's a powerful tool that can be misused.\n\nConsidering the combination of these events, while individually they don't seem too alarming, together they could hint at potential malicious behavior. The repeated registry writes by Chrome, especially if occurring multiple times in quick succession, might suggest tampering or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, file creation by both Winlogbeat and PowerShell could be part of a script's activity, possibly setting up files for later use or exfiltration.\n\nI'm also noting that the events are spread across different processes, which makes it harder to isolate any single event as malicious but together they form a pattern. The fact that multiple entries come from known legitimate processes like Chrome and PowerShell adds complexity because attackers often use these tools for隐蔽 activities.\n\nIn terms of confidence level, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because each individual action could be benign. However, the combination makes me hesitant—there's a slight possibility that these events are part of an attack chain, such as setting registry keys for persistence and using PowerShell for further actions. But without more context or additional indicators of compromise (like known malicious IPs or file hashes), it's hard to confirm.\n\nSo, I'm on the fence here. On one hand, nothing jumps out as clearly malicious. On the other hand, the pattern doesn't fit typical user activity either. My confidence isn't too high in classifying this batch as interesting without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include legitimate activities such as Chrome modifying registry values and Winlogbeat creating configuration files, with no clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
