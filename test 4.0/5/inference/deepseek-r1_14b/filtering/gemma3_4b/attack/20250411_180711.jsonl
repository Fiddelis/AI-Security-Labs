Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst up, there are multiple entries where 'chrome.exe' is involved. The tasks include Dns query and Network connection detected. That's pretty standard for Chrome because it does handle DNS lookups and network connections as part of its operation. So nothing unusual here; these events are expected and not a red flag on their own.\n\nThen, there's an entry with 'powershell.exe' where the task is Process accessed. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate administrative tasks and by attackers, so this alone isn't suspicious. However, I should keep an eye out for other actions in combination with this.\n\nNext, I see a process create event for 'whoami.exe'. That's interesting because whoami is often used to get user information, which can be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation in attacks. But again, without more context, it might just be a legitimate user checking their permissions.\n\nLooking further, there are several 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events for PowerShell. Registry modifications can be concerning because attackers might tweak system settings to facilitate persistence or other malicious activities. I should note how these tasks are being used in sequence.\n\nNow, the more critical part comes when examining the command line of one of the PowerShell processes. The script seems to be encoding some plaintext using XOR encryption with a key and then sending it via an HTTP POST request. That's a big red flag because encrypting data before sending it could indicate an attempt to hide malicious traffic or exfiltrate data. This kind of activity is often associated with command-and-control communication or data theft.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation and deletion events related to a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. The fact that the script is created and then immediately deleted suggests attempts to avoid detection by having minimal footprint on the system. This behavior aligns with common tactics used in malware to evade standard antivirus scanning and logging mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not look suspicious, the combination of using PowerShell for multiple tasks, especially including encryption and file operations in the Temp directory, raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The repeated network connections from Chrome are normal, but the PowerShell activities are more worrying. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe, including process creation and network activity, which could indicate potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows that the process is powershell.exe and the Windows log task is \"Pipe Created\". That's a bit generic because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, by itself, this might not be too concerning unless there are other indicators.\n\nNow looking at the next six events, all of them have similar command lines in powershell.exe. The command line seems to be doing something with encryption or obfuscation. Let me parse that command line:\n\n- They're getting bytes from a string that includes \"Path\" and a path like \"C:\\Users\\victim\".\n- Then they define a key, which is the alphabet plus some numbers.\n- They create an empty array for cyphertext.\n- There's a loop where each plaintext byte is XORed with the corresponding key byte. That's a simple substitution cipher, but XOR can be decrypted if the key is known.\n- After encrypting, they set an expectation for HTTP requests and make a POST request to example.com.\n\nHmm, making multiple POST requests with encoded data could be part of data exfiltration. Encrypting or obfuscating data before sending it over the network is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection. The repeated command lines suggest that this script is being executed multiple times, which might indicate persistence or multiple instances running.\n\nThe event also doesn't show any file access beyond \"None\", so no files are being written or read from disk in these events. But the fact that they're sending data to example.com could mean they're trying to send sensitive information out of the network.\n\nConsidering all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with a script that obfuscates and sends data is a red flag. Malicious actors often abuse PowerShell for its built-in features and to evade detection. The encryption might be an attempt to hide the payload or data being sent, which increases the suspicion.\n\nI'm also noting that each event has the same command line, which could indicate automated execution, possibly from a script or batch file. This kind of repetitive behavior is often seen in attacks where adversaries try to maintain persistence or distribute their activities across multiple instances to avoid detection.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events likely represent malicious activity, making the batch very interesting for further investigation. The confidence level is high because the combination of powershell.exe usage with obfuscation and data exfiltration is a strong indicator of potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing the same script that performs XOR encryption on user path information and sends it via POST request to example.com, indicating possible data exfiltration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is being executed with a command line that includes some Base64 encoding or XOR operations. The command seems to be taking plain text, encrypting it using a simple XOR cipher with the key \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\", and then sending it via POST request to example.com. This caught my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when combined with encryption and data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several instances of image loading (`Image loaded` task) for various DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. These could be normal operations, but it's worth noting that some might be related to legitimate processes or potential threats.\n\nThere are file creation events, including a `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file created by `winlogbeat.exe`. Since this is likely part of the log management setup, it probably isn't suspicious on its own. \n\nRegistry value sets and process accesses involving powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, Calculator.exe, svchost.exe, etc., are noted. While some of these processes are legitimate system components, repeated registry modifications by powershell.exe could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThe network event shows a DNS query for example.com, which is expected if there's an attempt to send data externally, but without knowing the destination's reputation, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch includes multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines that perform XOR encryption and send data over the network. This behavior could indicate data exfiltration or establishing a C2 channel, which are common indicators of malicious activity. The frequency of such events raises concern, suggesting potential compromise. Therefore, this batch is relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with XOR encryption and data exfiltration attempts detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a cybersecurity perspective. The goal is to determine if these logs are interesting or not for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are involved in registry value sets. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often tweak system settings to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. The fact that these legitimate processes are making changes to the registry might not be suspicious on their own, but when combined with other activities, it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity from chrome.exe. It's setting several registry values and loading various DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these could be normal operations for Chrome, especially related to security features or plugins, the sheer number of registry changes is notable. I wonder if this is part of some malicious activity using Chrome as a front.\n\nLooking further, there are instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve removing specific files. One line in particular stands out: it's using a script to delete a file named \"pacote_padrao_script.bat\" located at a specific path. The use of powershell for deleting files can be a common tactic in attacks, especially since PowerShell is often used for executing malicious scripts and has legitimate uses, making it harder to detect.\n\nAdditionally, there are several 'Process Create' events for whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Whoami is typically used to display user information, but when combined with other actions, it might be part of a larger attack chain, such as gathering system information before deploying more malicious activities.\n\nThe file creation event from winlogbeat.exe seems benign at first glance, but if this tool is being misused or if the created files are part of an exfiltration process, it could indicate suspicious behavior. However, without more context on how winlogbeat is being used here, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nOverall, while each individual event might not be overtly malicious, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe with specific commands, along with registry modifications and file deletions, raises concerns about lateral movement or persistence within a network. These activities are often indicators of an advanced persistent threat (APT) or ransomware attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes show suspicious activity including registry modifications, file deletions via PowerShell, and potential use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to figure out if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event and note what's happening. The logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see that they're all related to 'powershell.exe'. The tasks involve loading images (Image loaded) and accessing various files. For example, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others are being loaded. These could be part of normal PowerShell operations since it's a scripting environment that might load .NET libraries.\n\nNext, I notice that there are events where 'powershell.exe' is creating files in user directories, like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_temporario.txt'. Creating temporary files isn't unusual for scripts, especially if they're generating or processing data. However, the fact that it's PowerShell doing this might raise some flags because attackers often use PowerShell for its scripting capabilities and to bypass certain security measures.\n\nThen, looking at 'chrome.exe' events: these are all about registry value sets. Chrome sometimes makes changes to the registry when updating settings or extensions, so while unusual if done频繁, but individually they don't seem malicious. But since there are multiple such events from chrome.exe, it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe more concerning part comes later. There are several PowerShell command lines showing attempts to remove specific files with .bat extensions in various directories. The paths like 'C:\\componente_ativo\\pacote_base\\..\\\\modulo_principal\\registro_logico_script.bat' seem a bit generic, but the fact that multiple such scripts are being deleted is suspicious. This could indicate an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity or remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, these command lines use the Remove-Item cmdlet with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. Using Force can bypass normal access controls, which might be a red flag because it suggests someone is trying to delete files that they normally wouldn't have permission to or that are protected. The ErrorAction being set to Ignore means any errors during deletion won't surface, making this activity harder to detect.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell loading various .NET libraries and creating\/deleting temporary files. While these actions alone aren't necessarily malicious, combined with the repeated attempts to delete specific script files using potentially dangerous parameters raises concerns about possible malicious activities like hiding traces or executing scripts meant to cause harm.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that this could be legitimate administrative activity or script execution, but given the combination of file deletions and the specific paths targeted, it's more likely indicative of something suspicious. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some actions could be part of normal operations, especially if this system runs automated scripts, but the overall pattern does warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show file deletions with forced parameters and attempts to remove files with .bat extensions, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's start by looking through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe being executed with commands that remove files using Remove-Item. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. The paths they're deleting seem to have \"script.bat\" in them, which makes me think these might be scripts that are part of some process or malware.\n\nThen I see cmd.exe running some sc.exe commands to stop and delete services. Sc.exe is a service control command, so stopping or deleting services could indicate an attempt to disable security features or remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nThere are also several registry-related events from processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware to ensure it runs on startup or remains undetected.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other activities, it could be used to gather information about the system's user context, which is common in attacks.\n\nLooking at the variety of processes involved—powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, services.exe—it seems like an attacker might be using multiple tools and techniques to carry out their objectives. This diversity suggests a possible attack chain rather than isolated incidents.\n\nI'm also noticing repeated actions: multiple deletions via powershell.exe, multiple registry modifications across different processes, and the use of sc.exe to manipulate services more than once. These repeated attempts could indicate an active adversary trying to cover their tracks or escalate privileges.\n\nAnother point is that some events don't have file information, which might mean the files were deleted successfully, making it harder to trace back. The fact that these deletions are happening in different directories (like C:\\tarefa_geral\\estrutura_base and others) suggests a broader cleanup effort across the system.\n\nThe combination of process creation, registry modifications, file deletions, and service manipulations points towards potential malicious activity. It doesn't look like normal user behavior or routine system operations. These actions are more aligned with attack tactics such as persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, and impact.\n\nTherefore, putting all these events together, it seems highly likely that this batch is indicative of a security incident requiring investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell command deletions, cmd.exe service manipulations, and registry modifications.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell can be legitimate but also commonly used in attacks because of its powerful scripting capabilities. I see several instances where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. That's a bit concerning because attackers often use these actions to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\nAlso, I notice that cmd.exe was used with the command 'del \/A:H %temp%\\tarefa_logico.txt >nul 2>&1'. This deletes a specific file in the temp directory without any arguments, which might be an attempt to remove evidence or delete malicious files. The use of del with switches could indicate some level of persistence or cleanup activity.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is run. While this is usually benign and used to check user privileges, it can also be part of an attack chain to gather information about the system.\n\nI also see that several powershell.exe instances are creating files in the Temp directory. Specifically, a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1 is created and then deleted. This pattern—creating and immediately deleting a file—is suspicious because it could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace after execution.\n\nFurthermore, the event shows that powershell.exe loaded various .NET framework DLLs, which might not be directly malicious but could be part of normal operations. However, when combined with other events like registry modifications and file deletions, it raises concerns about potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms or script execution.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess tasks for powershell.exe are also notable. Such access patterns can indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or gain unauthorized access.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious actions, cmd.exe deleting files, and the creation\/deletion of a .ps1 file in Temp—it's likely that this batch of events is indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file deletions, and script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events. Each event has process info, winlog task, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal since it's part of the log system. Then there are multiple powershell.exe entries with Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripts and malicious activities, so that catches my attention.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is being called with \"& {}\", which might be a way to execute commands or load modules. Also, it's interacting with the registry, setting values, which could indicate some configuration changes—maybe installing something persistently.\n\nThere are file operations too, like creating a new file in the StartupProfileData directory. Creating files in user directories can be part of persistence mechanisms. Then, cmd.exe is deleting a file in the Temp folder. Deleting files might be to remove traces or clean up after an attack.\n\nThe whoami.exe process running from system32 could be checking user permissions or identity, which attackers often do to escalate privileges or gather info. Combining all these: powershell and cmd activities with file and registry manipulations, plus the deletion of a temp file—it feels like there's some malicious behavior here. It doesn't definitively prove it's an attack, but the combination raises red flags.\n\nI'm not seeing any direct indicators of known malware, but the pattern looks suspicious. So, I'd classify this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing file operations, registry modifications, and process creations indicate potential malicious activity or script execution that warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The events are all related to PowerShell.exe activity on a Windows system.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with the command line argument `& {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}`. This command deletes a file in the TEMP directory named key.log without throwing an error if it doesn't exist. Repeating this command several times might indicate that an attacker is trying to remove log files to cover their tracks, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell creates temporary files and immediately deletes them. For example, creating `__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1` and then deleting it shortly after. This behavior could be part of a script that doesn't want to leave evidence behind, which is suspicious.\n\nLooking at the types of events: there are process creations, file accesses, file creations, deletions, registry changes, and image loads. The repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands and file operations raises flags because legitimate use would typically not involve such repetitive deletions or temporary files creation\/deletion in this manner.\n\nThe fact that multiple similar events occur suggests automation, possibly from a script. Since the command is attempting to remove log files, it's likely an attempt to hide evidence of malicious activity. Therefore, this batch shows potential signs of suspicious behavior that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events showing file deletions and temporary file creation\/deletion patterns indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system, likely Windows based on the file paths and process names.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed. That immediately raises some flags because PowerShell can be both legitimate for admin tasks and also commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. \n\nLooking closer, one of the events has a command line argument that deletes a log file in the TEMP directory: 'powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}'. Deleting logs can be part of an attack to cover tracks. But I need to see if this is the only such event or if there are more concerning actions.\n\nThen, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are normal when running PowerShell scripts as they're part of .NET runtime, but excessive loading might indicate something else, though not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for a temporary script file: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1'. This seems like it could be a PowerShell script checking some policies or executing commands. The fact that the same script is then deleted with a FileDeleteDetected event might suggest something was done with this script, but without knowing its content, it's hard to say.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets and Process accesses. These could be related to persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts. For example, registry modifications can be part of creating persistent backdoors.\n\nLooking at the processes, 'conhost.exe' is also involved in a RegistryEvent. ConHost is typically used by Windows PowerShell to host console applications, but it's sometimes targeted by attackers for persistence or lateral movement.\n\nAlso, there's an event where whoami.exe is executed. This could be legitimate (e.g., checking user permissions) or part of an attack vector to gather information about the system.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances with various activities, file deletions, temp script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and a whoami execution. These behaviors individually aren't always malicious, but the combination could indicate malicious activity like script execution, log deletion (to hide traces), and possible persistence mechanisms or data gathering.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while some events are normal, the volume and specific actions suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.

That's a red flag because PowerShell scripts often used in attacks.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, many are \"Provider Lifecycle\", \"Engine Lifecycle\", and others related to process creation or file operations. These could indicate that the system is handling processes or files, but when combined with powershell.exe, it might be malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an instance where conhost.exe is involved in a registry value set. Conhost is usually used for console windows, but being part of such an event could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nMultiple whoami.exe executions stand out too. Using whoami without any output or arguments can be a way to check user permissions or privileges, which attackers might do during lateral movement.\n\nI notice that some file paths are specific and involve Windows Defender files, like MpClient.dll. This could be an attempt to load malicious code into legitimate processes.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a config file. While this tool is used for log shipping, it can sometimes be abused in attacks or misused by attackers to delete logs.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions with potential command line manipulations, use of whoami and conhost, and activity around legitimate system files could indicate malicious behavior.

That's a common tool that can be both legitimate and malicious because it has powerful scripting capabilities. But seeing it accessed multiple times could be normal, especially in environments where scripts are run regularly.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed a couple of times with the command line pointing to its default location. Whoami is usually harmless as it just reports user information. It doesn't do anything destructive, so that might not raise flags on its own.\n\nLooking further, I see powershell.exe accessing registry values. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities since attackers often need to persistence their access or modify system settings. However, legitimate software also modifies the registry sometimes, so it's context-dependent.\n\nThere's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used for log shipping, which makes sense if this is part of monitoring setup. That seems normal and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nPutting all these together: There are multiple powershell.exe accesses and a couple of whoami executions, along with a registry access by powershell. While individually some of these could be suspicious, the fact that they're spread out and include common activities like using whoami and legitimate log file creation might not be enough to indicate malicious behavior on their own.\n\nI also notice that many events are similar, which could just be normal script or tool executions rather than coordinated attacks. Without seeing additional indicators like failed login attempts, writes to sensitive files, network connections, or known malicious process trees, it's hard to conclude these logs as suspicious.\n\nSo overall, while powershell.exe is a red flag in some contexts, the lack of other malicious signs and the presence of normal system activities make this batch not particularly interesting for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal processes like PowerShell access and whoami.exe execution, which are common in legitimate activities.
