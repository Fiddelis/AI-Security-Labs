{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event involves powershell.exe creating a file: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt\". PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, repeated writes might be unusual. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious or just normal activity.\n\nThen, whoami.exe was executed. That's a standard tool used to get user information. It's usually not malicious by itself unless there's an irregularity in how it's being used, like with elevated privileges or in conjunction with other activities.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event stands out because of the command line: \"& {& \\\"C:\\\\tarefa_base\\\\tarefa_geral\\\\estrutura_secundario\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\" -LogPath $env:TEMP\\\\key.log}\". This script is named Get-Keystrokes, which suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes. That's definitely a malicious indicator as such scripts are often used for keylogging to steal sensitive information.\n\nThere's also another powershell.exe event with a similar command line pointing to a different path, again invoking Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition of running the same script from different locations is concerning and indicates potential malicious activity.\n\nThe events showing ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs are part of normal PowerShell operation when executing scripts, so these aren't unusual on their own but could be part of a larger suspicious pattern.\n\nLooking at all the events together, there's a combination of actions that raise flags. The use of powershell.exe to execute potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes), multiple instances of these scripts running from different paths, and whoami.exe execution might indicate a possible attack or data theft attempt. Chrome's registry interactions are less concerning on their own but could be part of broader activities.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.85 because while there are clear indicators of potential malicious activity, some events (like Chrome's actions) aren't conclusive on their own. However, the repeated use of powershell.exe with known malicious scripts strongly suggests investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) aimed at capturing keystrokes, indicating possible unauthorized data collection activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a batch of system log events and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events are related to PowerShell executing scripts. Specifically, several entries have command lines pointing to different paths with \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This script name suggests it might be logging keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware for keylogging. The repeated execution of such scripts across various file paths could indicate malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell creates and deletes temporary files, like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1\". This behavior might be an attempt to bypass certain script execution policies by creating and then deleting the script. It's a red flag because legitimate scripts usually don't behave this way.\n\nLooking at other events, there are file creations in different user directories and some registry modifications. While not all of these are necessarily malicious on their own, combined with the repeated PowerShell activity, it raises suspicion. The use of multiple paths for the script execution could be an attempt to avoid detection by varying the locations each time.\n\nAlso, one event mentions \"Execute a Remote Command\", which is another concerning sign because remote command execution can be used to download or run malicious code. This adds to the overall risk assessment.\n\nI should consider the confidence level here. The patterns observed—multiple instances of suspicious script executions, temporary file creations, and potential remote commands—indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior. However, without more context on the environment or user actions, it's hard to be 100% certain. But given the indicators, I'd rate the confidence at around 0.85.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch definitely warrants investigation because it shows signs consistent with malware activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) across different paths, along with creation and deletion of temporary files and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got three JSONL entries here, each representing an event.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: the process is svchost.exe creating a file in a specific path. Svchost.exe is known for being part of legitimate Windows services but can also be used by malware. However, just seeing it create a file might not be suspicious on its own—it could be normal system operation.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe, which I recognize as an ELK Stack tool used for log management. It's creating a new configuration file in the user's directory. This seems pretty benign since it's likely part of setting up or updating the logbeat configuration during installation or update.\n\nThe third event is powershell.exe creating a file called 'entrada_padrao.txt' in a user's Downloads folder. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but I should consider if this activity aligns with expected behavior. If the user is running scripts or automating tasks, it might be normal.\n\nLooking at all three events together: two of them involve file creation by known tools (svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe), and one involves PowerShell. There's no obvious sign of malicious intent like multiple failed logins, unexpected network connections, or known malicious file hashes. The files created don't have names that are commonly associated with malware.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit cautious because sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes for malicious activities. But without more context or additional events showing unusual behavior (like execution after creation or access from external sources), it's hard to classify these as suspicious.\n\nSo, overall, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. Each event individually seems benign, and together they don't form a pattern that raises red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate processes creating files in expected locations without indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
