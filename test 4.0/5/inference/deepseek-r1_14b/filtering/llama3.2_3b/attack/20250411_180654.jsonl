{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessing various tasks. That's common, but what's the context? There are multiple entries with command lines pointing to different paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests it might be capturing keystrokes, which is a red flag for potential malware activity.\n\nI see several events where PowerShell is accessing files, loading images, and executing commands. The repeated use of \"-LogPath $env:TEMP\\\\key.log\" in the command line indicates that these scripts are writing logs to temporary files. This behavior could be part of data exfiltration or malicious logging.\n\nAnother point is the file deletions and creations. Specifically, there's a File Delete logged event for a PowerShell script test file and a File created entry for a profile data file. While legitimate scripts might do this, combined with the other activity, it raises suspicion.\n\nThere's also an event where a remote command was executed, which could mean that the system is being controlled externally. This adds to the potential malicious behavior.\n\nI should check if these activities are part of normal operations or if they're unusual for the user\/system in question. Since multiple instances involve potentially malicious scripts and file manipulations, it's likely that this batch indicates suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes were created and accessed with command lines referencing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script paths. This script is known to capture keystrokes and may indicate malicious behavior. Additionally, file creation\/deletion events related to temporary log files were observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of two JSONL events. Each line is a separate event. Let me analyze them step by step.\n\nFirst event: The process name is winlogbeat.exe. That's the agent responsible for collecting Windows logs, right? So it's creating a file in its data directory with a .yml.new extension. That seems normal because winlogbeat often creates or updates configuration files as part of its operation. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nSecond event: The process is powershell.exe, which can be both legitimate and malicious since it's commonly used for scripting but also by attackers. It created a file named 'entrada_padrao.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. Now, 'entrada_padrao' translates to \"default input\" in Portuguese, but without more context, it's unclear if this is part of normal operations or something else. Maybe the user runs PowerShell scripts regularly, so this could be benign.\n\nLooking at both events together: One is a log agent doing its job, and the other is PowerShell creating a file. There's no indication of malicious activity like multiple failed login attempts, unexpected process spawns, or communication with known bad IPs. Both files are in standard user directories, and their names don't raise red flags.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually and together, these events don't show signs of compromise. Unless there's more context suggesting otherwise, like unusual timestamps or other related events, I wouldn't flag this batch for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate system processes (winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe) performing normal operations such as file creation. There is no indication of malicious activity in the provided data.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
