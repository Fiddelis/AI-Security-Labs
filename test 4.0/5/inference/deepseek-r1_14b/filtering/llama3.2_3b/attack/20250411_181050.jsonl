Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a whoami.exe process being created. Whoami is usually used to get user information, but it's common and not inherently malicious unless misused.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell can be used for good or bad things, so I'll keep an eye out for how it's used here.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creates a file. That makes sense if it's part of log shipping; no red flags yet.\n\nA cmd.exe process runs some commands: using certutil to encode and decode files. Certutil is often used in malicious activities because it can be used to decrypt payloads. This combination might indicate something suspicious, like encoding calc.exe into a different file.\n\nAnother powershell access eventâ€”so that's the second time. Maybe they're checking if it's running or something else.\n\nCertutil.exe is used again to encode and decode files. The command lines show specific files being processed, which could be part of creating an executable. This repeated use of certutil for encoding\/decoding is a big red flag because attackers often use this technique to obfuscate malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple FileCreate events from winlogbeat.exe and certutil.exe. The paths in the Temp directory suggest temporary files being created, which could be part of payload generation.\n\nRundll32.exe runs PcaSvc.dll with some task name. That's a bit unusual but not necessarily malicious unless it's known to be suspicious.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad events for combase.dll and urlmon.dll from SDXHelper.exe. These are legitimate system DLLs, so this might just be normal operation unless there's more context.\n\nChrome.exe has multiple RegistryEvent writes. This could be related to browser extensions or tracking, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding files, especially targeting calc.exe (which is a common payload delivery method), suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell and cmd with these tools could indicate an attacker trying to execute code or create malware on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of certutil.exe being used for encoding\/decoding files, particularly targeting calc.exe, which is often associated with malicious activities. The use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe in combination suggests potential command execution or payload delivery.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
