First off, there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe being executed and accessing various registry values. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. The command line in one of the events shows an attempt to import a PowerShell script from a path that seems suspicious—unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\.. might be trying to access or modify system configurations.\n\nI also notice several ImageLoad events by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, which are known for being used by various services but can sometimes be exploited. Svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory could indicate an update deployment process, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's normal or not.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks on PowerShell might suggest persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts. Additionally, the file paths loaded by these processes look legitimate, but the combination of actions—process creation, registry modifications, image loading—over multiple events makes me think there's a potential malicious script running in the background.\n\nWhile not all events are definitively malicious, the pattern here raises enough concern that further investigation is warranted. The use of PowerShell with specific scripts and the file operations by svchost.exe could be signs of unauthorized access or persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including script execution and registry modifications, along with suspicious file operations by svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a bunch of system log events in JSONL format and I need to figure out if this batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve processes like 'svchost.exe' creating files and setting registry values. Svchost is a common Windows process that runs services, so sometimes it can be used maliciously. But in this case, looking at the file paths:\n\n- The first three entries are files being created under \"C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\\" with various .dll extensions. That's normal for updates or patches being downloaded.\n  \nNext, there's an event from 'msedgewebview2.exe' loading a system32 DLL. That seems standard since Edge usesWebView2 for rendering.\n\nThen, more svchost.exe events: creating files and setting registry values. The file paths look like they're related to Windows Update or delivery optimization, which is normal when the OS is updating or managing updates.\n\nI also see some events from 'MpSigStub.exe', which is part of Windows Defender. It's loading DLLs and creating temp files in the usual places. No red flags there—it's just doing its job.\n\nThere are a couple of setup.exe processes creating files, probably during installation of Microsoft Edge components. That makes sense too.\n\nAll these activities seem to be normal background operations for system updates, antivirus operations, and software installations. I don't see any signs of unusual behavior like repeated attempts, access to restricted areas, or unexpected file creation in sensitive locations. The process names are typical, and the file paths align with standard Windows operations.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch doesn't indicate anything malicious. It's just regular system activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activities such as file creations, image loads, and registry updates related to system updates and legitimate processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: MsMpEng.exe loading mpengine.dll. That seems normal since it's related to Windows Defender.\n\nSecond event: setup.exe creating a file for EdgeCore. Again, standard software installation activity.\n\nThird event: whoami.exe running without any flags. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nFourth and fifth events: powershell.exe being accessed and then creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\". The command line has some encoded paths which might be trying to execute a malicious script.\n\nLooking at the next few events, powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and deleting a temporary file. This could indicate it's running scripts or trying to hide something.\n\nThen there are events where tarefa_logico.exe loads DLLs. Without more context, this could be normal or part of the malicious activity chain.\n\nThe later events show remote command execution and importing a PowerShell script from specific paths. The paths \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\" look suspiciously hardcoded, which might be part of a persistence mechanism ormalware.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a sequence involving powershell.exe executing scripts with custom command lines, creating services, and deleting files. These actions could indicate malicious behavior like installing backdoors or running unauthorized code. The multiple events tied to the same script paths increase the suspicion. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe executing scripts, creating services, and file deletions indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening here.\n\nFirst off, the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. There are 18 events in total. Looking at the first few, they all involve powershell.exe being executed with some command lines. The commands seem to be importing a PowerShell script from a specific path and then invoking a function called Invoke-entrada_principal, which translates roughly to \"Invoke-main_entry\" or something like that. There's also error handling included, catching exceptions and exiting with the HRESULT code.\n\nI notice that in the first three events, the task under winlog is either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. The process command line is the same across these: importing a module and then running this function. Then, from event 4 to 9, the command line changes slightly; it's now creating a new service using New-Service with specific parameters and starting that service. The task here again relates to Provider or Engine Lifecycle.\n\nStarting from event 10 onwards, there are events where the process is 'None', but the winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path points to component_auxiliary.ps1 in various directories. These seem like they're executing remote commands related to that script.\n\nPutting this together: the initial events show powershell.exe running scripts that either invoke some function or create services. The latter half shows multiple executions of a remote command pointing to the same PowerShell script, which could indicate repeated attempts to execute it, possibly over time.\n\nI should analyze whether these actions are normal or if they indicate malicious behavior. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and attacks. Here, the scripts are trying to import modules and create services. The repeated execution of remote commands might be concerning—if this script is doing something harmful, multiple executions could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking at the file paths: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum...\" translates roughly to \"C:\\logical_unit\\common...\", which seems like a made-up or obfuscated path. The fact that it's accessing \"..\\registro_secundario\" suggests moving up directories, which might not be typical unless it's part of the intended script.\n\nThe command lines have consistent syntax but are they legitimate? Using Invoke-entrada_principal and creating services with New-Service—could these functions be doing something malicious? Without knowing their exact purpose, it's hard to say. But the repetition is a red flag.\n\nAnother point is that multiple events in a short period could indicate automated or batch processing, which might be part of an attack. Also, 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks without corresponding process info (since process is None) could mean something is triggering these from elsewhere, possibly exploiting remote access.\n\nConsidering all this, the combination of powershell.exe executing scripts, creating services, and repeated remote command executions to specific files suggests potential malicious activity. The consistent patterns and multiple events point towards an investigation being necessary.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell execution events with suspicious script imports and service creations, along with repeated remote command executions pointing to the same file path. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given batch of events is interesting or not. Let's look at each event.\n\nMost of the events show a task named \"Execute a Remote Command\". They're all similar, repeating many times. Also, the file path points to the same PowerShell script: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1.\n\nI remember that repeated remote command executions on the same file could indicate malicious activity. It's suspicious because attackers might execute scripts multiple times to avoid detection or establish persistence.\n\nThere are a couple of events where process is 'services.exe' and task is 'Logon', plus one with 'Special Logon'. These seem normal as services can logon, but they're in the minority compared to the remote command tasks.\n\nThe volume of identical events is high. High repetition of the same event, especially involving remote commands, raises concern. It's unusual for legitimate activity to repeat an exact task so many times without variation.\n\nI should consider if this could be a script or scheduled task running periodically. But given that it's the same file each time and from different processes (most are None), it seems more like unauthorized access.\n\nThus, this batch is likely interesting as it shows potential signs of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of a remote command targeting the same PowerShell script, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I see that each event is in JSONL format, so there are multiple lines, each with a JSON object.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all have \"winlog\" task as \"Execute a Remote Command\". The file path mentioned is the same across most of them: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1. This path seems suspicious because it's referencing a PowerShell script, which is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nI notice that this pattern repeats multiple times—there are 14 events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" with the same file path. Then there are two events where the task is \"Windows Update Agent\", but no file is involved. That might be normal system activity, but it's worth noting because of the sudden change.\n\nSo, why does this matter? Repeated attempts to execute a remote command could indicate someone trying to run malicious scripts on the system. The fact that all these events point to the same script path suggests that perhaps an attacker is attempting to execute this script multiple times, maybe as part of a persistence mechanism or to ensure the script runs.\n\nI should also consider whether this activity is normal for the system. If legitimate users are running this script regularly, it might not be suspicious. But given the number of attempts and the fact that each one is an \"Execute a Remote Command\", it's more concerning. The use of PowerShell scripts in such contexts is often linked to cyberattacks because they can be used to execute commands, download files, or even establish communication with external servers.\n\nAdditionally, there's no process information listed, which might mean that the events are being logged at a different level, perhaps without the context of which processes triggered them. This makes it harder to link these events to specific applications or services, adding to the suspicion.\n\nThe two \"Windows Update Agent\" tasks could be part of normal system updates, but their inclusion in the same log batch might not add much to the Suspicious category unless there's a correlation between Windows Update activities and malicious behavior. In this case, it seems more like they are separate events, possibly unrelated to the remote command executions.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple repeated attempts to execute a remote PowerShell script could be indicative of malicious activity. The lack of process context doesn't help much in dismissing it as benign. Therefore, I would classify this batch as interesting because it raises red flags about potential unauthorized system commands being executed repeatedly.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated attempts to execute a remote command via the same PowerShell script path are potentially indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
