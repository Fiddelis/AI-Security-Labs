Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event is cmd.exe running a command that creates a service called win32times with a binPath pointing to another cmd command that starts a PowerShell script. The script path is c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1, which doesn't exist. This looks suspicious because creating services can be part of persistence mechanisms, and the non-existing script might indicate an attempt to hide or failed execution.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process accessed. Without seeing the exact command line, it's hard to tell, but PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities.\n\nThen, sc.exe is creating another service, win32times again, this time with a different script path: c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, non-existing scripts are red flags because attackers might use such paths to avoid detection or execute arbitrary code.\n\nThe services.exe process is setting registry values twice. Services.exe usually handles system services, so changes here could be legitimate, but they can also be used by malware for persistence.\n\nAnother sc.exe event checking the service status (qc). Legitimate admins might do this, but in combination with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nCalc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll are interesting. While these executables are common, the DLL is associated with URL handling, which could indicate some form of network activity or injection attempts. It's a bit unusual for calculator apps to load such modules.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file seems normal if it's an agent running, but without more context, it's hard to say. The path looks legitimate, but sometimes attackers use beat agents as part of C2 infrastructure.\n\nPowershell.exe again setting registry values could be malicious activity, like installing backdoors or altering system configurations.\n\nChrome.exe events include pipe creation and multiple registry writes. While Chrome can do a lot with its extensions and plugins, these actions might warrant closer look if they occur outside of user interaction, especially if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nLastly, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll. The Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) is something attackers try to bypass. Loading this DLL could be an attempt to disable AMSI protection or interfere with malware detection mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple instances of service creation attempts with non-existent scripts, which might indicate failed persistence attempts or malicious script execution. The use of cmd.exe and sc.exe for service manipulation is common in attacks. Additionally, the unusual file loads by calc.exe and chrome's interaction with system DLLs add to the suspicion. PowerShell's involvement is another red flag because it's frequently abused. Overall, these events don't look like normal user activity but could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including service creation attempts with non-existent scripts, use of cmd.exe and sc.exe for potential persistence, unusual file loads by calc.exe, and PowerShell registry modifications indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
