I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. **OfficeClickToRun.exe** doing a DNS query. That seems normal as Office apps often resolve domains.\n2. A PowerShell command looking for strings like 'pass' in various files. This could be suspicious because searching for passwords might indicate data theft or privilege escalation.\n3. Powershell creating a file in the Startup folder. Creating files there can allow persistence on startup, which is a red flag.\n4. Chrome doing several normal activities: pipe creation, DNS queries, loading DLLs, and network connections. These are typical for a browser.\n5. winlogbeat.exe creating a config file, which is standard for log management tools.\n6. whoami.exe run without arguments—usually benign but sometimes used in attacks to check permissions.\n7. cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks with schtasks. Deleting tasks can be part of removing traces or persistence mechanisms.\n8. schtasks.exe being used to delete more tasks. Again, this could indicate an attacker trying to remove logs or tasks.\n9. WMIC.exe deleting processes. If it's targeting notepad.exe, maybe harmless, but using WMI to manage processes is a common attack vector.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity. Notably, the PowerShell command searching for 'password' strings, creating files in startup folders, and deleting scheduled tasks could be indicators of an attacker trying to establish persistence or steal credentials.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events include suspicious activities like a PowerShell script searching for sensitive terms, file creation in startup folders (potentially for persistence), and deletion of system tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see an event where WMIC.exe is running and loaded a file related to Windows Defender. That's a bit concerning because WMIC can be used for remote command execution, but the file path seems legitimate as it's part of Windows Defender. Maybe just a routine update or scan.\n\nNext up are multiple cmd.exe processes with command lines that delete users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and others. Deleting user accounts is something an admin might do, but it's also a common tactic for malware to remove traces or elevate privileges.\n\nThere are several powershell.exe instances without any file paths mentioned, just process access events. Powershell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so I'm keeping that in mind.\n\nI notice cmd.exe being used with commands like 'net user \/del' which deletes users. These seem targeted as they have specific usernames ending with \"_Admin\". That pattern might indicate an attempt to remove administrative accounts, possibly to disable monitoring or take over system access.\n\nLooking further, there's a process where net1.exe is deleting a user across the domain. This could be more serious since it's affecting all networked computers. The command lines are clear and specific, which makes me think this isn't just routine maintenance.\n\nThere's also an event where sc.exe deletes a service called win32times. Deleting services can disrupt system operations, and if this is done without proper authorization, it might be malicious.\n\nAnother cmd.exe process uses del to delete temporary files in the %temp% directory. This could be part of cleaning up after some activity, which often happens in attacks to remove evidence.\n\nConhost.exe is running with a registry change. Conhost is typically used for console windows, but combined with registry modifications, it might be hiding malicious activities or altering system configurations.\n\nFinally, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. This command is usually used to check user permissions, which could be part of privilege escalation attempts or just recon.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with deletion commands, specifically targeting administrative accounts and services, along with file deletions in temp directories and registry modifications—these are red flags. They suggest a coordinated attack where someone is trying to remove user accounts, disable services, and cover their tracks. The pattern of behavior points towards potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nI'm pretty confident this batch shows signs of suspicious activities that need investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and deletions targeting administrative accounts, services, and files suggest potential unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs. So, I'm looking at multiple events here, each in JSONL format. The first thing that catches my eye is the variety of processes involved. There's cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and a lot of powershell.exe instances.\n\nStarting with the first event: cmd.exe deleting a file from a temp directory. That seems suspicious because legitimate software usually doesn't delete files in such a way without user interaction, but I can't be sure yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries involving whoami.exe being created as a process. Whoami is typically used to check user information, but seeing it spawn several times could indicate something's off. Maybe an attacker trying to gather user details?\n\nThen, the bulk of the events are from powershell.exe. Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers because it can execute scripts and do system-level tasks. I notice a lot of activity related to file creation, deletion, and registry changes. For example, creating a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1) and then deleting it right after seems like an attempt to remove evidence or bypass certain security policies.\n\nLooking at the image loads for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, these are part of .NET framework. While legitimate, they're also used in some malicious scripts. The fact that powershell is accessing them might be a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation event in the Windows Defender directory. That could indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activity as something related to antivirus software, which would be a common tactic for evading detection.\n\nI'm also noticing repeated Process Create events for both whoami.exe and powershell.exe, which might suggest automated or script-driven behavior—something that's not typical of normal user activities but rather indicative of potential malware trying to run multiple commands or scripts.\n\nThe combination of these behaviors—a suspicious file deletion by cmd.exe, multiple executions of whoami.exe, and extensive powershell activity with file manipulations and registry changes—points towards possible malicious intent. The repeated attempts to create and delete files could be part of a script trying to maintain persistence or erase traces.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that this is a user running legitimate scripts or tools that interact heavily with the system. But given the frequency and nature of these events, especially the powershell.exe activities which are often abused by attackers, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple process creations (whoami.exe and powershell.exe) and file manipulations, indicative of potential malicious activity such as script execution or evidence deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are two events where the process is calc.exe and Calculator.exe both loading urlmon.dll from the same path. That seems normal since those are standard system files related to calculations and Windows components. No red flags here.\n\nNext, an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack for log management, so it's normal for it to create or update configuration files. That doesn't seem suspicious either.\n\nThen there are events from powershell.exe being accessed and chrome.exe making DNS queries and network connections. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, the event here only mentions access without any unusual activity like script execution. Chrome's activities also look typical—DNS queries for browsing and network connections to websites.\n\nPutting it all together, none of these events indicate malicious behavior or anomalies beyond what's expected from normal system operations and user activity. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, file deletions, or other concerning actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard system processes such as loading DLLs, file creation by winlogbeat.exe, and normal network activities from Chrome.
