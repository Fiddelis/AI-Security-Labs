Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process running. That's typically a harmless command used to display user information, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, two entries show PowerShell being accessed without any specific commands. Alone, this might not be concerning since many legitimate processes use PowerShell.\n\nLooking further, I see a more detailed PowerShell event with a command line that includes creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path. This stands out because creating services is a common tactic in malware to achieve persistence. The binary path points to 'tarefa_logico.exe' located in a user's directory, which isn't a standard system location, raising suspicion.\n\nThen, there are file creation and deletion events related to PowerShell scripts in the temp directory. Creating temporary script files can be normal, but deleting them immediately might indicate an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity.\n\nMultiple registry value sets by 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' catch my attention. Modifying the registry is another red flag because attackers often use it to maintain persistence or configure malicious settings.\n\nThe setup.exe process creating several files for EdgeCore seems legitimate, as updates or installations often do this.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating a new service with an unusual name, modifying the registry multiple times, and handling temporary PowerShell scripts suggests possible malicious activity.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are from processes like 'setup.exe' and 'svchost.exe'. Setup.exe is commonly associated with software installations, so multiple file creations under different paths might just be part of the installation process. The files created include things like .bat scripts and executables for Edge and msedge_proxy, which seems normal if Microsoft Edge is being updated or installed.\n\nThen there are events from 'svchost.exe', which is a common Windows process that can host various services. Some of these events involve creating temporary files in the Windows Temp directory with names like APPX.*.tmp. These look like they could be part of package extraction during updates, so that's not unusual either.\n\nLooking at the Registry activity, both 'setup.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are modifying registry values and objects. While suspiciousregistry changes can indicate malicious activity, in this context, since these processes are legitimate and often handle such tasks during installations or service operations, it might just be normal behavior.\n\nThe only event that stands out is the one from 'powershell.exe'. It's running with an execution policy set to Restricted and executing a Write-Host command. Powershell can be a vector for attacks because of its scripting capabilities. However, in this case, the command seems benign—it's simply writing \"Final result: 1\" to the console. The fact that it's using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted might indicate it's following some security best practices, but it's still worth noting because sometimes attackers use Powershell for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's a mix of normal installation processes and legitimate system operations, along with that one Powershell event. While the Powershell usage could be concerning, without more context indicating malicious intent (like other suspicious activities or known attack patterns), it's hard to say if this batch is indicative of an actual security incident.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the majority of the events are typical for system operations and software installations. The confidence level isn't very high because the Powershell command does raise a slight red flag, but without additional indicators, it's difficult to confirm malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal system operations such as file creations and registry modifications related to software installations.

This could be concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The repeated ImageLoad events might indicate script execution or module loading, which isn't inherently bad but could be a red flag if combined with other behaviors.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line where 'powershell.exe' is run with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. This could prevent scripts from executing unless explicitly allowed, but sometimes attackers use this to avoid detection by restricting script execution. The actual command in the process event seems benign at first glance—it checks for specific .inf files and looks for a particular pattern. However, this behavior could be part of a larger script or payload that's trying to check system configurations or look for vulnerabilities.\n\nThere are also events where 'whoami.exe' is executed. This is commonly used by attackers to gather information about the current user, which might precede privilege escalation attempts or lateral movement within a network. While standalone, in combination with other activities, it raises suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, I see 'cmd.exe' being used to run Dism commands. The command '\/c Dism \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet' stands out because it's attempting to disable Windows Defender features and remove them without restarting the system. Disabling antivirus software is a common tactic in malware to prevent detection, so this could indicate malicious activity.\n\nMoreover, 'Dism.exe' is involved in loading files from a temporary directory. The paths like 'AssocProvider.dll' and 'DismCorePS.dll' might be custom modules or payloads being deployed. If these files are unfamiliar or if their hashes don't match known legitimate versions, they could be malicious components.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell executions with specific commands, attempts to disable security features using Dism, file creation in temporary directories that could host malicious scripts, and the use of whoami.exe—all point towards potential malicious behavior. These activities are often part of an attack chain aiming to compromise system security or establish persistence.\n\nTherefore, the combination of these events is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions loading various DLLs and creating files in temporary directories, combined with attempts to disable Windows Defender using Dism.exe, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows that 'Dism.exe' created a file called 'DismHost.exe'. Dism is known as the Deployment Image Service Installer, which is part of Windows for servicing operations. Creating files related to it can be normal during system updates or deployments.\n\nLooking at the subsequent events, all of them are from the same process 'Dism.exe', and each reports a task where an executable file is detected. The paths in these events point to various .dll and .mui files located in temporary directories under the user's AppData folder. These are typically language resource files for DLLs, which makes sense during the execution of system-related processes.\n\nI notice that all the events are occurring in a single directory within the Temp folder. This suggests that Dism.exe is extracting multiple components into this temp location, which aligns with its role in deploying or servicing images where it might extract necessary files.\n\nThe fact that multiple .dll and .mui files are being detected as executables could raise an eyebrow, but given the context of Dism.exe's operation, it's entirely normal. These files are part of the system's legitimate processes and aren't indicative of malicious activity.\n\nThere's no indication of any unusual behavior such as access to restricted areas, multiple failed attempts, or deviations from standard operating procedures. All events follow a consistent pattern typical of Dism.exe performing its intended functions.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't show signs of malicious activity. It's likely just part of a routine system update or servicing process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the legitimate operation of Dism.exe and involve the creation and detection of standard files during its execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each line is a JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I notice that the same process, Dism.exe, is executing multiple times with similar file paths. The files being accessed have names like TransmogProvider.dll.mui and others. These seem to be DLL files related to different providers, possibly part of system setup or configuration tools.\n\nThe events show 'File Executable Detected' tasks from the Windows log. This rule usually triggers when an executable file is created or modified, which could indicate potential malicious activity. However, I remember that Dism.exe is a legitimate Microsoft tool used for deployment and servicing of Windows images. It's commonly used during OS installations or updates.\n\nLooking deeper, all these events are happening in the same temporary directory: C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\. Temporary files are normal during software installations or updates, so this doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nThere's also an event where DismHost.exe is run with a specific command line parameter. DismHost is another legitimate component used in the same context as Dism.exe, often for servicing Windows images. The file paths and activities here align with standard operations performed by these tools during system setup or updates.\n\nSince all these events are consistent with normal operations of known Microsoft utilities, there's no indication of malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let's see what each event is telling me.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where the process is DismHost.exe and the task is Image loaded. Each of these has a different DLL file being loaded into memory. The paths all point to a temporary directory under AppData for user fiddelis. So this looks like some legitimate files being loaded as part of normal operations, perhaps related to system image management or deployment.\n\nThen, there's an event where DismHost.exe process is terminated. That seems natural if the process completed its task and shut down.\n\nNext, I see events from Dism.exe. These are File Delete logged tasks, each deleting a file from the same temporary directory. The files being deleted include various DLLs like CbsProvider.dll, DismCore.dll, and others, along with some MUI files which are usually language resources. \n\nPutting this together, it looks like DismHost.exe was loading several DLLs into memory during its execution, and then Dism.exe is cleaning up by deleting those temporary files. This sequence of events aligns with how the DISM (Deployment Image Service Manager) tool operates when performing tasks like servicing Windows images. The process loads necessary components, performs operations, and then deletes the temporary files to free up space and maintain system integrity.\n\nI don't notice any signs of malicious activity here. All actions are typical for DISM operations. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, unusual file names, or persistence mechanisms that would indicate malware. The use of temporary directories is standard for such processes, which helps prevent leaving unnecessary files behind.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch doesn't raise any red flags.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries where each line represents an event involving the deletion of files by Dism.exe.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are from the same process: Dism.exe. That's the Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool, which I know is used for servicing Windows. It's part of the operating system, so it's not something malicious in itself. \n\nEach event logs a file deletion under different paths within the Temp directory. The files being deleted are various .dll.mui and .dll files, all located in the same temporary folder. The repeated pattern suggests that Dism.exe is systematically removing these files as part of its normal operation. Since Dism is an established system tool, this behavior aligns with its expected functionality.\n\nI'm checking if there's any red flag here. Are multiple deletions unusual? Well, during servicing operations or updates, the system might clean up temporary files. So it makes sense for Dism to delete these files after they're no longer needed.\n\nIs there anything suspicious about the file paths? The path is consistent across all events, which again points to a legitimate process rather than malicious activity trying to erase different files in various locations.\n\nCould this be part of an attack where an adversary is covering their tracks by deleting logs or other evidence? In that case, I'd expect more varied file types and possibly hidden or less common system files. Here, the files are all resource DLLs related to providers, which Dism handles as part of its job.\n\nAlso, the fact that each event has exactly the same structure and only varies in the specific file path makes me think it's a batch operation rather than random deletions spread out over time. That consistency is typical of legitimate system processes.\n\nI also consider whether the number of events could be concerning. There are 14 entries here, but Dism might handle multiple files during an update or servicing process. It's not unusual for such operations to generate several log entries as they delete temporary files.\n\nIn summary, all signs point towards these being normal operations by a legitimate system tool. No anomalies in the file types, paths, or process indicate malicious intent. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly concerning from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is not considered suspicious. The deletions are performed by Dism.exe as part of its routine operations, removing temporary files that are no longer needed. The consistent and expected behavior aligns with the tool's known functionality, making these events normal rather than indicative of malicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"info\",\n  \"message\": \"The batch of events is not considered suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out what's going on with these logs. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial entries look like some kind of event data. The \"event\" field has a long string that seems to be base64 encoded or something similar because it starts and ends with curly braces and contains special characters. I'm not entirely sure how to decode this, but maybe it's related to process information or file operations.\n\nNext, there are entries where both \"process\" and \"winlog\" fields have values like \"None.\" That probably means that either the process or the Windows log didn't capture any specific details at that point. Not too concerning on its own, but I should keep an eye out if this pattern continues.\n\nThen, starting from the third entry, there's a recurring command line in the \"process\" field: it's using powershell.exe to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo.\" The binary path points to a file called tarefa_logico.exe located in a specific directory. This seems suspicious because creating services via PowerShell can be a common tactic for malicious activities, like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThe \"winlog\" field consistently says \"Provider Lifecycle,\" which I think refers to events related to system providers starting or stopping. That makes sense if they're creating a new service because that would trigger provider lifecycle events.\n\nI'm wondering why there are multiple entries with the same command line. Maybe this is part of an automated script running multiple times, but it could also indicate some kind of loop or persistence mechanism where the service is being recreated repeatedly.\n\nLooking at the file field, all these entries have \"None,\" so no specific files were captured in these events, which is a bit odd if they're creating and starting services. I would expect some file references, especially for the binary path mentioned.\n\nI should check what \"objeto_ativo\" means. Translating it from Portuguese, it's \"active object.\" Not sure if that's relevant or just a name chosen by the attacker. The directory structure in the binary path seems off too: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum...\" doesn't look like standard Windows directories. Maybe they're using custom paths to hide their activities.\n\nI'm also thinking about the potential impact of this activity. If an attacker is creating a service, they might be trying to establish persistence on the system so that their malicious process starts automatically at boot. The fact that it's done via PowerShell adds another layer because scripts can sometimes bypass certain security measures or be harder to detect.\n\nI should consider possible indicators of compromise here. Creating services, especially using non-standard names and paths, could be a sign of malware. Also, repeated attempts might indicate testing or an attempt to ensure the service is successfully deployed.\n\nTo validate my thoughts, I'd need to look deeper into each field:\n\n1. Decode the base64 string in the first entry if possible, to see if it reveals more about the process or file operations.\n2. Correlate these events with other logs around the same time to see if there's a pattern or additional context.\n3. Investigate the directories and files mentioned to check for any anomalies or signs of tampering.\n4. Review the system's service list to see if \"objeto_ativo\" is present and running, which would confirm that this service was successfully created.\n5. Look into any recent changes in user accounts or permissions that might allow such services to be created without proper authorization.\n\nI'm also thinking about possible防御措施。Since the activity involves creating a service via PowerShell, enforcing strict policies on script execution and monitoring for unauthorized service creations could help mitigate such threats. Additionally, regular audits of system services can ensure nothing malicious is running undetected.\n\nIn summary, these logs suggest potential malicious activity where an attacker is attempting to create and start a service using PowerShell. The repeated attempts and unusual naming conventions raise suspicions. To confirm, I'd need to dig deeper into the specifics of each event and possibly involve more advanced security tools or techniques.\n<\/think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided logs, here's a structured summary of findings and recommendations:\n\n### Findings:\n1. **Base64 Encoded Data**: The initial entry contains a long string that appears base64 encoded. Decoding it might provide insights into process or file operations, though specific details couldn't be extracted without decoding.\n\n2. **Recurring PowerShell Command**: Subsequent entries show repeated use of `powershell.exe` to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo.\" This points to potential malicious activity, as attackers often use such methods for persistence.\n\n3. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: The consistent \"Provider Lifecycle\" task in the Windows log suggests these events are triggered by service creation or management activities.\n\n4. **Suspicious File Path**: The binary path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum...` is non-standard, possibly indicating an attempt to hide malicious files.\n\n### Concerns:\n- **Repeated Attempts**: Multiple entries with the same command line may indicate testing, persistence attempts, or automated scripts.\n- **Unusual Naming and Paths**: The service name \"objeto_ativo\" (active object) and directory structure raise suspicions of potential tampering.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Decode Base64 String**: Decode the initial base64 string to gather more detailed information about the process or file operations involved.\n\n2. **Correlate Logs**: Look for additional logs around the same time to understand the broader context and identify any patterns or related activities.\n\n3. **Investigate Directories and Files**: Check the directories mentioned in the binary path for anomalies or signs of unauthorized access.\n\n4. **Review System Services**: Examine the system's service list to confirm if \"objeto_ativo\" exists, indicating successful service creation by an attacker.\n\n5. **Enhance Security Policies**:\n   - Enforce strict PowerShell script execution policies.\n   - Monitor for unauthorized service creations and unusual activity.\n   - Regularly audit system services to ensure nothing malicious is running undetected.\n\n6. **Advanced Monitoring**: Consider deploying advanced security tools or techniques to detect and prevent such activities in the future.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs suggest potential malicious activity involving service creation via PowerShell, which could be an attempt at persistence. Further investigation and proactive security measures are recommended to mitigate risks."}

This seems suspicious too because accessing system files like INF could indicate an attempt to gather information or modify system configurations.\n\nThe fact that multiple similar commands are being run repeatedly makes me think this might be part of a script trying different things, possibly as part of an attack vector.

I'm not entirely sure what those mean, but it seems like they're related to system service events. The file field is None in all cases, which might mean no file was directly accessed or written during these events.\n\nThe PowerShell command itself is trying to read INF files and check if their content matches a specific regex pattern.

But I'm wondering if this activity is normal or if it's something malicious.\n\nSince each event uses Restricted ExecutionPolicy, that usually means only scripts signed by trusted publishers can run. So maybe the script is trying to do something that requires higher privileges but is restricted.
