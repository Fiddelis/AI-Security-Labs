{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to see if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and look for patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that several entries are from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute commands. Looking at the command lines, some of them have scheduled task actions set to run calc.exe at logon. That seems suspicious because why would someone schedule a calculator to run on login? It doesn't make much sense unless they're trying to hide malicious code.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe is creating new scheduled tasks with different names like entrada_ativo, entrada_temporario, tarefa_geral, and estrutura_auxiliar. These names don't seem to have any obvious meaning, which might be intentional obfuscation. Scheduled tasks running at logon as Administrators with highest privileges could indicate persistence mechanisms, which are often used by attackers to maintain access.\n\nAdditionally, there are several instances where files are being deleted or created in the Temp directory, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Temporary PowerShell script files can be a sign of malicious activity if they're trying to bypass certain policies or execute commands without proper permissions.\n\nI also see multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process information, which could mean remote execution is happening outside the usual logging methods, making it harder to trace back to the source. This might be an attempt to hide the true nature of the activity.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with potentially malicious commands and the file deletions in temporary directories raise red flags. The combination suggests a possible attack where an adversary is establishing persistence on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon, file deletions in temporary directories, and remote command executions. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are several entries here from different processes like powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Let's go through each one to see if anything stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nThe first event has a task labeled \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That immediately raises a red flag because executing remote commands can be a sign of remote access or command-and-control activities, which are often associated with malware.\n\nThen there's an entry from powershell.exe where a file was created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. Creating files in non-standard locations might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms, like adding scripts to run at startup without user interaction.\n\nAnother event shows that a registry value was set using powershell.exe. Malware often modifies the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or to alter system configurations. This could mean the attacker is trying to ensure their commands run every time the system starts.\n\nLooking at conhost.exe, which is a legitimate process, but again there's a registry modification. Conhost isn't typically malicious on its own, but if it's used in conjunction with other activities, especially after a remote command execution, it could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries show image loading and DNS queries. While these can be normal browser operations, the fact that they're combined with other suspicious activities like registry modifications and file creation might suggest some form of lateral movement or data exfiltration. Malware often uses legitimate processes to blend in, making detection harder.\n\nPutting it all together, the sequence starts with a remote command execution, followed by file creations and registry changes from powershell.exe and conhost.exe. These actions don't seem to be part of normal user behavior. The use of multiple processes to perform these tasks could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or spread within the system.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level here. While each individual event might not be conclusive, the combination suggests a coordinated effort that is likely malicious. However, without more context like timestamps showing rapid succession or specific file hashes, I can't be 100% certain. So, my confidence is high but not absolute.\n\nIn conclusion, this batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity, particularly the remote command execution and subsequent system modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a remote command execution followed by file creation and registry modifications from powershell.exe, which may indicate malicious activities such as persistence or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
