Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is the creation of DiscordSetup.exe. That's normal since it's part of installing Discord. Next, Update.exe is created and runs with some command line arguments. I'm not sure what that does yet, but it seems related to updates.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for Update.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These seem legitimate as they're part of .NET framework, which Discord might use. Then, a file is created by Update.exe in the local AppData folder, which could be temporary during an update process.\n\nI notice ProcessAccess events for both Update.exe and Discord.exe. This usually happens when processes interact or share resources, nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there are multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe. These are common for inter-process communication, so that's expected behavior.\n\nThe second Process Create event is for Discord.exe with a command line that looks standard—launching the app with specific parameters like user data directory and GPU settings. The command line seems normal; it's typical for Electron-based apps to have such flags.\n\nFile loads include ffmpeg.dll which Discord uses for media handling, so that's expected too.\n\nPutting it all together, these events seem to be part of a standard installation and operation of Discord. The creation and loading of necessary files and processes don't indicate any malicious activity. Everything aligns with how Discord would update or run normally without signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the normal installation and operation of Discord, including process creation, image loading, file operations, and inter-process communication. There are no indicators of malicious or suspicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events related to Discord.exe being created and accessed. The command line shows it's running with various parameters, which seems normal for Discord as it's a well-known application. There are also several Image Load tasks pointing to different DLL files, which again is typical for an application starting up.\n\nThen, I notice some file creation events by Update.exe. It's creating shortcuts on the desktop and in the Start Menu. This could be part of standard updates or installation processes, so nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nThe interesting parts come when reg.exe is used to add registry entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. Specifically, it's setting a value with \"URL:Discord Protocol\" and another for \"URL Protocol\". These registry changes might be an attempt to register Discord as a protocol handler. While legitimate applications do this, it could also be a sign of malicious activity aiming to hijack the system's protocol handling.\n\nLooking at all events together, there are multiple instances where reg.exe is used in quick succession to modify the same registry keys. This pattern isn't typical for normal updates or usage; usually, Discord would handle its own registration during installation without multiple separate processes. The repeated use of Process Create and File Create rules adds some weight to this suspicion.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, while there's nothing overtly malicious in individual events, the combination raises a red flag. The repeated registry modifications by reg.exe could indicate an attempt to create a persistence mechanism or alter system behavior in a way that's not standard for Discord updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry changes made using reg.exe to set URL protocol handlers for Discord, potentially indicating unauthorized protocol hijacking.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The user wants only one classification: INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nLooking at the events, they all seem related to Discord being run on a system. The first event shows reg.exe adding a registry value under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord, which might be setting up an association or hook for Discord. Then there are multiple Process Create events for both Update.exe and Discord.exe with various command-line arguments. These command lines look like standard Discord startup parameters, including paths to the executable, user data directories, and other options typical of Electron-based applications.\n\nI notice that each Discord process creation is followed by Image Load events for its components like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, libEGL.dll, etc. These are all legitimate files required for Discord's operation, so nothing suspicious there. There's also an Update.exe accessing the registry, which might be related to updates or configuration.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The processes and file accesses align with normal Discord operations. No unusual file creations, network connections, or registry modifications beyond what Discord typically does. Everything seems consistent with a user running Discord normally.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard Discord processes and image loads, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I've got a bunch of system log entries here, all from what looks like Discord being run on a Windows machine. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. Starting with the first entry, it's Discord.exe creating a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk. That seems normal because when you install an app, it creates shortcuts on your desktop.\n\nThe next few entries are about Process accessed and Pipe Created events. These are pretty common in Windows for interprocess communication. I don't see any red flags here; these are typical actions for a running application.\n\nThen there's reg.exe being used to add registry keys under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. This looks like Discord setting up its own protocol handler, which is standard for apps that want to handle URLs like \"discord:\/\/...\" in the system. The command lines show they're modifying the registry to set the default icon and shell commands. That's normal behavior for an application wanting to integrate with the OS.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple Process Create events from both Discord.exe and reg.exe. These are just instances of the program starting up or running scripts, which is expected.\n\nI also notice a Network connection detected event. Since Discord is a communication app, it needs to connect to servers, so that's not unusual. There's an Image Load event for ffmpeg.dll, which makes sense as Discord likely uses FFmpeg for audio and video processing.\n\nThe last few events are more Process accessed and Network connections, plus a Registry value set. These all align with Discord running normally—accessing resources, making network calls to their servers, and updating its configuration in the registry.\n\nPutting it all together, this batch of logs doesn't show any signs of malicious activity. They're all standard operations for Discord starting up and functioning properly. There's no indication of unauthorized access, strange file creations outside the app's scope, or unusual network traffic. So, I wouldn't consider this batch interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to Discord.exe and its normal operations, including process creation, registry modifications, file access, and network connections, which do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
