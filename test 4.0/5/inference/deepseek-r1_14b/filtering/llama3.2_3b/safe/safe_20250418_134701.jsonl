Each event is a JSON object with details about file creation in Windows. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", and each time it's creating a file in a specific path under the user's Downloads directory. Specifically, these files are all part of the node_modules folder related to Cypress types for functions like isNative, isNull, etc.\n\nHmm, so first thought: Git is often used for version control, especially in development environments. It makes sense that when someone runs certain Git commands, it might create or update files. The fact that these are .d.ts files indicates they're TypeScript definitions, which are part of the Cypress testing framework setup. So if someone is working on a project using Cypress, this activity would be normal during development.\n\nI'm considering whether there's anything unusual here. All events show \"git.exe\" creating files in expected locations. There's no indication of any failed operations or errors, just successful file creations. The paths are all within the node_modules directory, which is standard for npm packages and their types.\n\nIs there a chance this could be malicious? Well, sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools like Git to hide their activities, but in this case, it doesn't look like it. No files are being created outside of typical project structures, and all are under Cypress and node_modules, which are common in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nI also think about the volume of events. There's a series of file creations here—14 events total. While that seems a bit high for manual activity, it could easily be automated by a script or part of a build process. So, unless there's evidence of unusual timing or patterns beyond this batch, it doesn't raise red flags.\n\nAnother angle: checking the user context. The path includes \"fiddelis\" as the username, which is likely a local user account. If this user has appropriate permissions and is actively working on their projects, these file creations would be normal.\n\nSo putting it all together, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior here.

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event. The common elements across all these events are that they were generated by the process \"git.exe\", the task under winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file paths all lead to different .d.ts files in a node_modules directory related to cypress and lodash.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that git.exe is commonly used for version control. It's not inherently malicious, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual on its own. The task indicates that a file was created, which is a standard operation during development or when installing dependencies.\n\nThe file paths point to TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) within the node_modules directory. This makes sense because when you install Node.js packages like Cypress, their type definitions are placed there. These events likely occurred during the setup or update of the project, as part of npm or yarn installing dependencies.\n\nI'm considering whether such activity is typical. In a development environment, it's normal for files to be created in node_modules as part of the installation process. So, these events don't seem out of the ordinary. There's no indication of any file creation attempts in sensitive areas or outside the expected project structure.\n\nAnother thing I'm checking is if there are multiple similar events that could indicate a pattern. All events are from the same user (fiddelis), all relate to git.exe, and all target files within the same directory. This consistency suggests routine activity rather than malicious behavior.\n\nI also think about potential red flags. If these were EXE or DLL files being created in system directories, that might raise suspicions. But here, it's just creating type definition files, which are standard for TypeScript projects. There’s no evidence of file deletion, execution, or movement to other locations, which could be signs of tampering.\n\nFurthermore, the paths don't show any unusual patterns. They're all within a course directory (S206 - Qualidade de Software), which seems like a study group or project folder. No signs of hopping into system32 or other protected areas.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure these events are benign. The combination of git.exe and file creation in node_modules for development tools is textbook normal. Unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise, like unusual timestamps or multiple failed attempts, this doesn't warrant investigation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process creating expected files in a known project directory during setup.

That's interesting because git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The fact that it's creating files makes me think of operations like cloning repositories or installing dependencies, which are pretty standard when working with Node.js projects since npm often uses git under the hood.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within \"node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\".

That seems like it's part of an educational institution since the path includes \"inatel\" and \"S206\", which might refer to a specific semester or subject code. \n\nThe process name being git.exe makes sense because Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments where node_modules are typical. The files created here are TypeScript definition files (the .d.ts extensions), which are standard when working with TypeScript projects and Node.js modules like Cypress.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all fall under the cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp directory. This suggests that these are part of the Cypress testing framework's type definitions for Lodash functions. Since Lodash is a popular utility library in JavaScript\/TypeScript projects, having its types being set up or updated isn't unusual during development.\n\nThe repetition of similar file creation events by git.exe indicates that this might be part of a Git checkout or sync process where the repository is pulling down these files for the first time or updating them.

Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. \n\nFirst, I notice that every entry has the same process name: git.exe.

The file paths all point to different .d.ts files within the Cypress types directory under node_modules.\n\nHmm, so what could this mean? Well, Git often creates or updates files when you're working with version control, especially during operations like cloning repositories, pulling changes, or adding new files. The paths listed are all type definition files for Lodash functions in the Cypress testing framework. That makes sense if someone is setting up a development environment, as these files would be part of the project's dependencies.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is normal or unusual. Since the user is interacting with their node_modules and using Git, it's likely that they're working on a software project. The creation of multiple type definition files at once could be part of installing or updating dependencies via npm or yarn, which often happens during development. \n\nIs there any red flag here? Well, sometimes attackers might try to create files in certain directories to hide malicious activities, but node_modules is a common and expected location for legitimate software installations. The fact that all these files are related to Cypress and Lodash doesn't raise any immediate concerns—it seems consistent with normal development workflows.\n\nAlso, considering the volume of events—there are 14 entries here, each creating a different .d.ts file. While it's a bit on the higher side, I don't see anything inherently suspicious about multiple files being created in quick succession during a Git operation. It could just be part of a bulk install or a script running multiple tasks.\n\nAnother angle to look at is whether these file creations are happening outside of typical business hours or without user interaction, but since I don't have that context, it's hard to say. If this were an isolated incident or if the files were in unexpected locations, I might be more concerned. But as it stands, everything points towards normal development activity.\n\nI should also think about alternative scenarios where such log entries could indicate malicious behavior. For example, could these file creations be part of a larger attack vector? Maybe, but without more context like unusual process names, writes to unexpected directories, or other anomalies, I can't find evidence of that here.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple files being created by Git.exe in a node_modules directory as part of the Cypress types.
