{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is about mmc.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because MMC is a legitimate tool used for managing system components. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe being created and accessing files. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The command line shows that it's executing scripts like \"teste.ps1\" with the ExecutionPolicy set to Bypass, which is a common tactic in attacks because it allows running scripts that would otherwise be blocked.\n\nI notice several ImageLoad events for different DLLs when PowerShell starts up. These are standard as PowerShell loads various components and libraries, so by themselves they aren't suspicious.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for a temporary script file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1\" followed by it being deleted. This could be part of testing script execution policies, which might indicate someone checking if scripts can run without detection. Alternatively, attackers sometimes create and delete files quickly to avoid analysis.\n\nAnother FileCreate event is for \"teste.ps1\" in the Downloads folder. That's a direct script execution, possibly malicious depending on its content. Without knowing what the script does, it raises concern.\n\nThere are Provider Lifecycle events which I'm not too familiar with, but given that they're from PowerShell, they might just be part of normal operation.\n\nLastly, there's a FileCreate event for \".winlogbeat.yml.new\" related to winlogbeat.exe. This seems unrelated unless the tool is misused, but it's more likely legitimate.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple instances where PowerShell is creating and executing scripts with an execution policy bypass, along with script file operations, are concerning. These activities could be indicative of malicious behavior such as lateral movement or payload delivery. While some events might be normal, the combination suggests potential investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with potentially suspicious activity, including script execution and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe created a file in the Temp directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be suspicious, especially if it's an unexpected script.\n\nThe second event reports that powershell.exe deleted the same file. File creation followed by deletion might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or test if certain actions are allowed without detection. This behavior can be a red flag as attackers often try to cover their tracks.\n\nThe third event is another file creation, this time in a Microsoft Windows PowerShell directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This location isn't typical for temporary files and might be part of an attempt to modify system configurations or load malicious scripts at startup.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file operations in non-standard locations is concerning. These actions could be signs of potential malicious activity, such as script testing or persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation and deletion events by powershell.exe in non-standard locations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
