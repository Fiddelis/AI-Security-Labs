{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably nothing suspicious there. Then there are several powershell.exe processes being accessed and some registry activities. Powershell can be used both benignly and maliciously, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe executing csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. Compiling code isn't unusual, especially if a user is developing something. However, the paths mentioned in the command lines are a bit long and seem temporary, like using %TEMP%. This could indicate some form of script or tool being built on the fly.\n\nThere are multiple file creation events by csc.exe, creating .exe files in temp directories. Generating executables can be a red flag if it's unexpected. Also, several ImageLoad events loading various DLLs and other executables might be part of legitimate processes, but again, combined with the other activities, it's something to watch.\n\nThe process names like 'modulo_secundario.exe', 'estrutura_ativo.exe' sound generic but could be indicators of custom tools or malware components. Additionally, there are Registry value sets by various processes, including RuntimeBroker and conhost.exe, which could be part of legitimate operations, but also potentially used in persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: a lot of process creations, network connections, file writes, and registry changes. This combination suggests potential malicious activity, especially if these actions don't align with normal user behavior. The use of temporary files for compiled executables and multiple powershell accesses could be signs of script execution or payload deployment.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because the activities seem a bit too coordinated and involve components that are often part of attack chains. However, without seeing the full context, there's uncertainty. But based on what's provided, it does raise some red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple process creations and file activities, including the use of temporary files and powershell.exe accesses, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of different processes. There's powershell.exe appearing a few times, which is known for both legitimate use and potential malicious activities because it can execute commands. But in these logs, it's mostly accessing itself or registry values, not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, I'm not too familiar with the exact behavior of calculator processes, but loading a DLL from C:\\Windows\\System32 might be normal since that's a legitimate system directory. But could it indicate something malicious? Maybe not necessarily, unless there are other signs.\n\nMultiple events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common Windows process, often used by services, so seeing it modify the registry isn't unusual. However, repeated registry modifications might be a red flag if they're unexpected or in bulk. Here, each instance only does one modification, but there are several entries from svchost.\n\nThen I notice that winlogbeat.exe creates some files. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used for collecting logs (like from Windows), so creating data files seems normal and not suspicious.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe also sets a registry value, which doesn't immediately raise flags since it's a legitimate process related to application hosting in Windows.\n\nLooking further, Calculator.exe again accesses the registry. That might be more concerning if calculators are supposed to interact with the registry, but I'm not sure about that. It could be part of its operation or something else.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing itself and setting a registry value. Powershell is high-risk, so any activity beyond normal use should be looked into. But without seeing other indicators like file creation or network connections, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe events with tasks related to registry modifications and loading DLLs. Chrome is a browser that does many legitimate things, including accessing system libraries. The paths shown for these files (like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll) are standard system files, so this doesn't seem unusual unless there's something else going on.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe entries with registry sets. Again, if the process is running as expected, these could just be normal operations like setting preferences or extensions.\n\nAlso, I see that winlogbeat creates files twice in the logs. That might be a bit odd because it shouldn't need to create multiple new files unless there's an issue, but maybe it's part of its data collection process. Not sure if that's significant.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are several events involving processes with legitimate purposes making changes (like svchost, powershell, chrome), none seem to stand out as clearly malicious on their own. The repetition might be a bit concerning, especially multiple registry writes from the same processes, but without additional context like timestamps or other event correlations, it's hard to definitively say they're malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no evidence of known attack patterns, such as process injection, file creation in unusual locations, or network communication. All files referenced are within standard system directories, and the actions taken by each process seem within their normal operation parameters.\n\nTherefore, while some events might look suspicious at first glance, the overall batch doesn't provide enough information to classify them as definitely malicious. However, there's a low level of concern due to the repeated registry modifications, which could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry value changes and file accesses by various processes may indicate potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
