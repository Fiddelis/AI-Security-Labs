{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're relevant for investigation. They specified that I should return only one result with the classification, justification, and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. The first event shows PowerShell creating a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt'. That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Then there are multiple entries from chrome.exe modifying registry values, which isn't unusual but could be worth noting if it's excessive.\n\nLooking further, I see several instances where whoami.exe was run, which is a common tool for checking user information. Not inherently suspicious unless used inappropriately. The next event is another PowerShell process accessing something, and then there are multiple registry writes by chrome.exe again.\n\nThe key events that stand out are the two PowerShell processes with command lines executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. This script name suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity—like a keylogger used for stealing information.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various .NET framework components. While this isn't directly suspicious on its own, combined with the execution of scripts known for surveillance, it raises red flags.\n\nThe last three events show PowerShell processes executing similar command lines, each referencing different script paths but all aiming to log keystrokes to temporary files. This repeated pattern indicates a possible attempt to gather sensitive information over time.\n\nPutting this together, the batch includes multiple signs of potentially malicious behavior: script execution for keylogging and repeated process creations with such scripts. While some events might be benign, the combination points towards something that warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts (e.g., Get-Keystrokes.ps1) which are known for keylogging and persistence techniques. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, process creations involving whoami.exe, and image loading activities from powershell.exe that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe with command lines running scripts from various paths like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" and setting the log path to the TEMP directory. These look suspicious because Get-Keystrokes sounds like it could be a keylogger script, which is often used maliciously to capture keyboard input.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe deletes files, creates pipes, loads images, and modifies the registry. Creating pipes can allow communication between processes, which might be part of a larger attack chain. The file deletions and registry modifications could be an attempt to cover tracks or install persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also notice multiple instances of the same script paths being executed by powershell.exe, which suggests repeated attempts to run potentially malicious code. The fact that several events come from different paths but all point back to similar scripts is concerning—it could indicate a campaign trying to execute at different locations.\n\nLooking further down, there are non-powershell events like winlogbeat.exe creating files and svchost.exe creating files too. These might be legitimate processes doing their thing, but I need to see if they're part of the malicious activity or just normal system operations. However, considering that most events are powershell-related with possible malicious intent, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of suspicious activities involving powershell executing scripts that could log keystrokes, along with other actions that might be part of an attack. The repetition and combination of these events make me think this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including execution of potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated attempts to execute similar scripts from different paths. These events may indicate a potential malicious activity such as keylogging or persistence mechanism.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
