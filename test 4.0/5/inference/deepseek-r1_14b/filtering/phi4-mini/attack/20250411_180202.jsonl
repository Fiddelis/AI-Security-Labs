{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting but can also be malicious. Next, whoami.exe running – that's usually harmless, just checking user info. Then more powershell.exe accesses; seems like it's being used multiple times.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command with \/c wmic process call create notepad.exe. WMIC is a powerful tool often used by attackers for remote commands. Using wmic to create processes could be a sign of malicious activity, especially since it's creating notepad.exe, which might just be a cover.\n\nMore powershell.exe events follow – each time accessing or modifying something. Then, WMIC.exe loading various DLLs. The first is urlmon.dll, which handles URLs; then amsi.dll, used for anti-malware scanning. This could be an attempt to bypass AMSI by unloading it. Also, Defender-related DLLs are loaded – maybe trying to disable or manipulate Windows Defender.\n\nwmiprvse.exe modifying the registry. That's another red flag since wmi is often exploited for persistence. Registry modifications can indicate setting up malicious services or startup entries.\n\nNotepad.exe being created might be innocent, but given the context of other events, it could be part of a payload execution chain. conhost.exe running and modifying the registry – conhost is used for console windows, but again, in this context, it's suspicious if it's doing registry changes.\n\npowershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt' – temporary files are often used by malware to store data or payloads. The path is specific to a user's Downloads folder, which isn't the usual system directory, making it more concerning.\n\nwinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file – could be legitimate if it's part of logging setup, but in this case, paired with other events, it might seem odd unless it's expected behavior. RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry again; not sure about that one, but registry changes are often monitored for anomalies.\n\nPutting all together: multiple powershell and WMIC processes, registry modifications, loading DLLs related to anti-malware, creating files in user directories... This looks like a coordinated attack. The sequence of events suggests possible lateral movement or payload deployment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe and WMIC activities, including registry modifications and file creations in user directories, which may indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or payload deployment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
