Let me take a closer look at each one and see if anything stands out as suspicious or indicative of malicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's a PowerShell process accessing some registry value. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so alone that's not too concerning unless there are other flags. Next, cmd.exe is running some commands: systeminfo to gather info on the system and then querying the Registry for disk services. That seems like standard admin activity or perhaps part of a script.\n\nThen another PowerShell event accessing a process. I see cmd.exe again setting a registry value, which could be normal but might also be part of persistence mechanisms if it's changing something unusual. There's a systeminfo.exe being created—probably not malicious since it's a legitimate tool for system info. Notepad is next, writing to the registry, which is expected as some apps do that.\n\nThe calculator event loads urlmon.dll—that's a known DLL in Windows, so nothing wrong there. Svchost.exe creating files and modifying registries—svchost is a common process, but sometimes it's used by malware. However, here it seems to be creating log files, which could be normal depending on what service it's running.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe is another known process for WMI services; its creation isn't suspicious. Reg.exe querying the registry is straightforward and not alarming. ApplicationFrameHost.exe writing to the registry again—it’s part of Windows apps, so nothing odd.\n\nLooking at Chrome, multiple instances accessing the registry. That could be legitimate if Chrome is being updated or extensions are doing something, but it's a bit unusual. Seven times in a row with registry writes might raise an eyebrow—maybe checking for something repeatedly or attempting persistence.\n\nPutting this all together: several processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are touching registries, which can be normal but could also indicate malicious activity. Svchost.exe is modifying logs and the registry, which could be part of service operations but needs attention if it's doing so in an atypical way. The repeated Chrome events might be concerning—maybe a script or extension trying to write multiple times.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because while some activities are common, others like svchost.exe creating files and the numerous registry writes by Chrome could indicate something more malicious. My confidence isn't too high (around 0.6) since it's hard to tell without context, but there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell and cmd.exe accessing registry values, which could indicate potential malicious activity or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, svchost.exe creating files and Chrome making repeated registry changes are concerning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are from chrome.exe with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded'. These activities aren't unusual since Chrome often interacts with system components. The files it loads, such as amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, are legitimate Windows Defender components, so that's normal.\n\nThere's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management, so this activity is expected and not suspicious.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. However, the filename doesn't raise any red flags immediately, and without more context like script execution or other anomalies, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, all events seem to fall within normal user activity. There are multiple registry writes from Chrome, which could be due to updates or extensions. The lack of other suspicious activities like network connections, process creation without parent context, or file deletions makes me lean towards these events not being concerning.\n\nWhile the PowerShell event catches my eye a bit, it's not enough on its own to warrant investigation without more data. Therefore, I classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity, including Chrome interacting with system components and legitimate file operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
