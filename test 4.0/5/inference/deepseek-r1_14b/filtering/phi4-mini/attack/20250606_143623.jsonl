{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs. The goal is to determine whether these events are interesting for investigation or not. I'll go through each event step by step and see if any red flags pop up.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being accessed and executed. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities. The fact that it's being called multiple times might not immediately raise a red flag, but I'll keep an eye out for any suspicious commands.\n\nThe fifth event stands out because the command line includes some obfuscated code. It mentions creating a service with `New-Service` and starting it using `Start-Service`. This is concerning because creating new services can be a tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence on a system. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" translates to something like \"active object,\" which doesn't seem standard or necessary for normal operations.\n\nAnother red flag is the file path in the command line: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This looks like it's pointing to a custom executable, and the path structure seems off. Legitimate software usually doesn't have such convoluted paths, especially ones that include terms like \"registro_comum\" which might suggest some kind of logging or registry-related activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is accessing various DLL files and registry values. While PowerShell does load several libraries when running scripts, the combination of these accesses with the creation of a new service could indicate that something malicious is being set up in the background.\n\nI also notice that one of the events logs a file deletion: `File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)`. This event deletes a script from a temporary directory. Deleting files can be part of an attacker's attempt to cover their tracks, removing evidence of their activity. The presence of both file deletions and service creations makes this batch more suspicious.\n\nFurthermore, there are several entries where `services.exe` is modifying the registry multiple times. While system services do interact with the registry, repeated writes without corresponding reads can be a sign of tampering, especially if they're done by a process that's not usually responsible for such changes.\n\nPutting all these pieces together: multiple PowerShell executions, obfuscated commands creating a new service, file deletions, and registry modifications. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of these events doesn't seem to align with normal system operations, making this batch highly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell execution with suspicious commands and file deletions indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are two events from \"tarefa_logico.exe\" loading some DLLs. That seems normal because many processes load DLLs when starting up. The files mentioned are part of the .NET framework, which is a legitimate library, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nNext, I see several entries from powershell.exe creating a file and setting registry values. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things, but just executing scripts isn't suspicious on its own. The file path looks like it's related to the user profile for PowerShell, which is standard behavior when starting up the environment.\n\nThen there are multiple events from services.exe writing to the registry. Services.exe is part of Windows Service Control Manager, so that's a system process. It's normal for services to interact with the registry to manage their configurations or settings.\n\nThe next set of logs comes from MsMpEng.exe setting registry values. MsMpEng.exe is related to Windows Defender, so it's legitimate and expected to make registry changes as part of its operation.\n\nA significant portion of the logs are from svchost.exe writing to the registry multiple times. SvcHost is a common host process for various services, including those from third-party applications or Windows itself. It's not unusual for svchost.exe to interact with the registry frequently.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I don't see any indicators of malicious activity. Each process's actions align with their standard operations. There are no signs of unexpected file creations, unusual DLL loads, or suspicious network activities mentioned here. The frequency of the events also doesn't exceed normal behavior for a system in operation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of standard system processes performing legitimate operations such as loading DLLs, creating files, and modifying registry values.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events. Let me look through them carefully.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe and services.exe performing registry operations—setting values or modifying objects. Svchost is a common process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might indicate something suspicious like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes typical of malicious activities.\n\nThen I see several events from setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft Edge directory. It's normal for setup.exe to install software, but the specific paths and multiple file creations could be concerning if these files aren't expected updates or new installations. The presence of various .exe files and batch scripts might hint at dropped malware components or additional tools being placed on the system.\n\nCombining both types of events—registry modifications and file creation—it raises flags about potential malicious activity, such as installing software without proper authorization or setting up persistence in the registry. These actions are often part of an attacker's process during an intrusion.\n\nThe repetition of these events also stands out; multiple instances suggest a systematic process rather than random actions. This could mean an attacker is deploying several components or updating existing ones.\n\nSo, considering all these factors together, the batch does seem relevant for investigation as it shows signs that might indicate malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'll go through each event step by step and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events are split between processes named 'setup.exe', 'services.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', and 'svchost.exe'. These are all system-related processes, which is normal. However, their activities might be worth looking into.\n\nLooking at the tasks performed by these processes:\n\n1. **Registry Events**: There are multiple events where both 'setup.exe' and 'services.exe' are setting registry values or modifying registry objects. Registry modifications can indicate legitimate operations, but they're also a common tactic for malware to establish persistence or modify system configurations. The fact that 'setup.exe' is making several registry changes stands out because setup utilities typically do this, but the frequency here might be unusual.\n\n2. **File Creation**: Some events show files being created in specific paths. For example, 'svchost.exe' creates temporary APPX files in the Windows Temp directory. This seems normal as svchost is a known process for running services and often handles such tasks during updates or installations.\n\n3. **Pipe Created Events**: There are instances where 'setup.exe' creates named pipes. While this can be part of legitimate inter-process communication, it's also a method used by malware to create hidden channels for command-and-control communications.\n\nNow, considering the combination of these events:\n\n- The repeated registry modifications by 'setup.exe' could indicate that the process is installing something persistently or making configuration changes that are beyond typical setup operations.\n- The creation of multiple temporary files might suggest an installation or update process. However, the high number of such events, especially combined with the registry activity, raises suspicion.\n- The named pipe creations might not be malicious on their own but could be part of a larger plan to establish communication once other components are in place.\n\nI'm also considering whether these activities align with known behaviors. For instance, legitimate software installations do perform registry writes and file creation, especially during setup. However, the frequency here seems high, and 'setup.exe' is doing a lot more than usual—over 15 events of registry modifications and pipe creations.\n\nAnother angle is the use of different processes: 'services.exe' modifying the registry might be normal for system services, but the combination with 'setup.exe's activities makes me think that perhaps this setup process is running in an environment where it shouldn't, or it's behaving unusually.\n\nPotential red flags:\n- Multiple registry modifications by a non-standard process.\n- Creation of multiple named pipes which could be indicators of lateral movement or communication channels.\n- The high number of events overall might indicate some form of automated or script-driven activity, possibly malicious in nature.\n\nI also need to consider the context. If these events are happening during an actual software installation, they might not be suspicious. But without that context, and given the volume and types of activities, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nIn conclusion, while individual events could be normal, the combination raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation. The repeated registry writes and pipe creations by 'setup.exe' are particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and named pipe creations by setup.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from svchost.exe creating files and modifying the registry. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, so these activities on their own aren't necessarily suspicious. They could be part of normal system operations.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple file creation events in various locations like C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness with different S-1-5-... paths. These seem to be related to the AppReadiness service, which is responsible for preparing files during Windows updates or installations. It's common for this process to create temporary files.\n\nThere's also a series of registry value sets by svchost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate system operations, especially since svchost runs services that might require setting certain registry keys.\n\nThen, towards the end, there are events from powershell.exe. The command line shows a restricted execution policy running a Write-Host command. Restricted policies typically prevent script execution, so this is likely just a benign command to output a message. However, it's a bit unusual to see such a specific command in logs, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe powershell.exe also loads some .NET DLLs and creates a temporary file in C:\\Windows\\Temp. These actions are normal when running PowerShell scripts or commands as they load necessary libraries and might create temporary files for execution.\n\nI don't see any overtly malicious indicators here like known bad processes, unusual file paths with executable extensions, or network connections to suspicious domains. Everything points towards normal system activities, possibly during a software update or maintenance tasks.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, they seem more like legitimate operations rather than signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal file creation and registry modification activities from svchost.exe and PowerShell execution under a restricted policy, which are typical system behaviors.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe' being executed with various commands. One of them has the command line showing an execution policy set to Restricted and a script that checks for specific INF files related to installation directories. This could be legitimate administrative activity or potentially malicious if the script is trying to gather information or make unauthorized changes.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process running Dism commands to disable and remove Windows Defender features. That caught my attention because disabling antivirus can be a red flag, as it might indicate an attempt to lower system defenses. Using Dism in this way could be part of a legitimate system configuration task, but it's also commonly used by attackers to bypass security measures.\n\nLooking further, there are several File Executable Detected events from Dism.exe pointing to various DLL files in temporary directories. This seems unusual because those paths don't seem standard for normal operations; they look more like temporary files that might be dropped during an attack. The presence of multiple such files could indicate some form of malicious activity or tool deployment.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell executing a script, disabling Windows Defender via cmd and Dism, and creating temporary DLL files suggests a potential attempt to gain persistence or elevate privileges. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could be signs of an attack. While there's no smoking gun here, the pattern is concerning enough that it warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell script execution targeting system files, disabling Windows Defender via cmd and Dism, and creating temporary DLLs, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that all events have \"Dism.exe\" as the process name. Dism usually stands for Deployment Image Service Installer, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating systems. It's commonly associated with installing updates or creating installation images. So, by itself, seeing Dism.exe running isn't suspicious.\n\nEach event has a \"winlog\" field indicating different tasks. The first event says \"File Executable Detected,\" and the second mentions \"File created.\" The files involved are various DLLs like DismCorePS.dll, DismHost.exe, and several .mui files in an en-US directory. These seem to be part of the standard Windows servicing components, especially since they're located in a temporary folder under AppData.\n\nI see multiple events where Dism.exe is detecting executables or creating files. The paths are all within a temp directory, which makes sense because Dism might extract files during its operations. The fact that there are several .mui files suggests these are language-pack related, which again aligns with Windows updates and servicing.\n\nNow, considering the volume of events—there are 14 in total—it's possible that this is part of a larger update process or some deployment activity. However, each event seems consistent with normal operations rather than anything malicious. There's no indication of access to restricted areas, failed login attempts, or other red flags typically associated with attacks.\n\nI should also consider if there are any anomalies in the timestamps or frequency of these events. If Dism.exe is running multiple times in quick succession, it might indicate something unusual, but without that context, it's hard to say. However, based on the information given, each event appears legitimate.\n\nAnother angle is checking for known malicious activities related to Dism.exe. From my knowledge, while attackers sometimes misuse legitimate tools, Dism isn't commonly associated with attacks. It's more of a red flag if there are unusual command-line arguments or file accesses outside its typical behavior, which I don't see here.\n\nAlso, the files being accessed are all within the expected scope for Dism.exe. No encrypted files, strange extensions, or known malicious hashes are mentioned. The temp directory is a common place for such operations, and the .mui files support that this is part of Windows' update process.\n\nIn summary, each event points to normal Dism.exe activities during servicing or updates. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious file handling, or unusual behavior.

My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event. They all have similar structures:\n\n- The process name is Dism.exe.\n- The Windows log task is \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected.\n- The file path points to various .dll files in a temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89.\n\nI notice that each event is almost identical except for the specific DLL file being detected. There are 14 such events, each with a different DLL in the same temp folder.\n\nNow, I need to consider what Dism.exe does. Dism is a tool related to Windows deployment and servicing. It's often used during setup or updates, especially for deploying images or performing offline servicing. So when it's running, it might extract various components from an image, which could include DLL files.\n\nLooking at the file paths: all the DLLs are in a temporary directory with a long GUID-like folder name. That suggests they were extracted temporarily and will be cleaned up after use. This is common during normal operations where images or packages are being processed.\n\nThe \"File Executable Detected\" event is triggered because each of these DLL files is an executable resource. Dism.exe would typically extract these as part of its operation, so this isn't unusual behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The same process (Dism.exe) is consistently creating these files in a temporary location, which aligns with standard Windows operations. There's no indication of unauthorized access, strange file origins, or persistence mechanisms typical of malware.\n\nAdditionally, having multiple such events doesn't raise red flags because Dism might extract several components during its operation. Each event is just part of the normal process flow.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these events are likely part of a legitimate Windows deployment or servicing process. There's no evidence of compromise or suspicious activity here.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event.\n\nThe first event shows that Dism.exe was executed and triggered the FileExecutableDetected rule. That makes sense because it's detecting a new executable file being run. Then, there are multiple subsequent events where DismHost.exe is loading various DLL files from the same temporary directory. Each of these loads triggers the ImageLoad rule.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different .dll files in a temporary folder under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The names of these DLLs like WimProvider.dll, DismCorePS.dll, etc., seem related to system operations—maybe part of an installation or update process.\n\nAfter loading all those DLLs, there's an event where the process is terminated, which isn't unusual if it's part of a normal cleanup. Then, the last event shows that AppxProvider.dll was deleted by Dism.exe after being detected as deleted by FileDeleteDetected rule.\n\nPutting this together, I'm thinking that these events are likely related to a legitimate system operation, possibly an update or installation using DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tools. The repeated loading of DLLs and subsequent deletion don't raise red flags for me. They seem like standard steps in such processes.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here—nothing out of the ordinary or indicative of unauthorized access or data exfiltration. All actions are happening within a temporary directory, which is typical for such operations. The fact that multiple related events come from DismHost.exe and Dism.exe further supports this being part of normal system behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because the activities described align with expected system processes rather than malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: NOT INTERESTING**\n\nThe events in question are related to legitimate system operations involving the DISM tool. The actions, including the execution of Dism.exe, loading of DLLs by DismHost.exe, and subsequent deletion, align with typical behaviors during updates or installations. There is no evidence of malicious activity, making this batch not interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The events are part of normal system operations using DISM tools, involving the loading and deletion of files in a temporary directory.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event and then considering them all together.\n\nEach line in the JSONL file represents an event with three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process name is consistently Dism.exe across all events. I remember that Dism.exe is related to the Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool in Windows, which is used for servicing Windows images. So it's a legitimate system process.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most of them are labeled as 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. This suggests that files were deleted, but since Dism.exe is part of normal system operations, especially during OS updates or image deployments, deleting temporary files is something it does regularly. There's also one event where the task is 'File creation time changed', which might indicate an attempt to modify file metadata, possibly to obscure timestamps as a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe file paths all point to C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various DLL and MUI files. These are temporary directories, so it's typical for Dism.exe to create and delete files there during its operations. The specific files being deleted include .dll and .mui files, which are common in Windows for language-specific resources and dynamic link libraries.\n\nI should also consider the user context. The path includes 'fiddelis' as the username. If this is a legitimate operation, Dism.exe would run under that user's context when performing image servicing or updates. Malicious actors might use similar process names but different file operations, but in this case, all events seem to align with known behavior of Dism.exe.\n\nLooking for patterns: multiple deletions of various DLLs and their MUI counterparts suggest a cleanup operation after some deployment activity. The one event changing the creation time could be part of an attempt to make files appear older or newer, which is sometimes used in attacks to evade detection based on timestamps.\n\nHowever, since all the file operations are under Dism.exe's usual activities, it's less likely to be malicious unless there's evidence that these operations are occurring outside of normal usage times or in an unusual sequence. Without additional context like timestamps showing activity at odd hours or repeated failed attempts, it's hard to label this as suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the consistency of the process name and file paths. If there were deviations from expected behavior, such as writing to unexpected directories or accessing restricted areas, that would raise more flags. But here, everything points to standard temporary files in a known temp directory.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Dism.exe performing multiple deletions and a single file timestamp change is within its normal operations when servicing an OS image. Therefore, while the File creation time changed event could be something to watch, without more context, this batch doesn't seem particularly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is not considered suspicious based on the analysis. Here's a concise summary:\n\n- **Process Name**: Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows system process used for servicing OS images and updates.\n- **File Operations**: The events involve deleting temporary files in a known temp directory, which is standard behavior for Dism.exe during deployment activities.\n- **User Context**: The operations are under the 'fiddelis' user context, typical for such system processes.\n- **Potential Concern**: A single event changing file creation time might warrant monitoring but isn't conclusive of malicious activity without additional context.\n\n**Conclusion**: This batch likely represents normal Dism.exe operations and does not indicate suspicious or malicious behavior."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nEach line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name in every case is Dism.exe.

The files being deleted are all DLLs located in a temporary directory within the user's AppData folder.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services and is used for servicing the OS, including tasks like deploying images. It's legitimate and doesn't typically indicate malicious activity on its own.

Dism is known to be related to the Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool, which is part of Windows for deployment purposes. It's usually used by IT professionals or during OS installations and upgrades.\n\nEach event has a 'winlog' field indicating that a file deletion was logged under the rule 'FileDeleteDetected'. The files being deleted are all DLLs located in a temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by some random-looking GUID, and then specific provider names like WimProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc. These DLLs sound like they could be part of the system's componentization process during OS setup or servicing.\n\nI notice that all the files being deleted are under the same temporary directory, which is a common practice for applications needing to extract and then clean up after themselves. The fact that 'Dism.exe' is performing these deletions makes sense in this context because Dism is often involved in deploying or servicing an operating system, where it might copy components into a temp directory and delete them once done.\n\nConsidering the user's account name ('fiddelis'), if this were part of a legitimate OS update or deployment, I wouldn't expect any red flags. However, I'm wondering if these events are happening outside of such a controlled environment. Since all these deletions are happening in a temp directory and by Dism.exe, it doesn't immediately scream malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers might abuse legitimate tools like Dism for their purposes. Could this be an indication of that? On the other hand, since each event is just a file deletion logged, without any signs of other suspicious activities (like creation or execution of files), it's hard to see how these alone would pose a risk.\n\nAnother angle: temp directories are often targets for malware because they can be written and cleaned up easily. However, in this case, the process is explicitly 'Dism.exe', which is a known legitimate system tool. So unless there's evidence that Dism.exe has been compromised or is running with unexpected parameters, these deletions might not be malicious.\n\nI also think about how often such events occur during normal operations. If Dism is being used for OS deployment or updates, it would make sense to see multiple file deletions in a temp directory. The volume here—14 events—is significant but could still fit within a legitimate process, especially if this was part of a larger operation.\n\nIn summary, while the activity is notable, there's no clear indication that these deletions are malicious. They appear consistent with what Dism.exe would do during normal system operations, such as installing updates or deploying a new OS image. Without additional context or evidence of other suspicious behavior, I wouldn't classify this batch of logs as an immediate security concern.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process and Activity:**\n   - Each event shows the process 'Dism.exe', associated with Windows deployment tools.\n\n2. **Understand File Operations:**\n   - All events log file deletions detected under a temp directory, removing specific DLL files.\n\n3. **Assess Context of Dism.exe Usage:**\n   - Dism.exe is typically used for OS deployment and servicing, often involving temporary files which it deletes after use.\n\n4. **Evaluate Temp Directory Usage:**\n   - Temporary directories are common for extraction and cleanup in software processes, supporting the legitimacy of these deletions.\n\n5. **Consider Potential Malicious Use:**\n   - While Dism.exe could theoretically be abused, there's no evidence here (like unexpected parameters or additional malicious activities) to suggest such misuse.\n\n6. **Analyze Frequency and Pattern:**\n   - The number of events is significant but aligns with expected behavior during a deployment or servicing operation.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - These logs likely represent normal system operations, specifically related to OS deployment or updates, rather than malicious activity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log entries represents legitimate file deletions performed by Dism.exe as part of Windows deployment or servicing processes, and there's no evidence of malicious intent in these activities. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"incident\": {\n    \"status\": \"Closed\",\n    \"determination\": \"Benign Activity\",\n    \"description\": \"The events are normal system operations related to OS deployment using Dism.exe.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze these logs that were provided. They seem to be from a system, possibly Windows, given the mention of svchost.exe and Registry value set events. The user has shared several entries in JSON format, each containing information about processes, windows log tasks, and files.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each entry, there are three main fields: process, winlog, and file. Each field seems to capture different types of system activities or logs. For example, some entries mention process creation, others talk about registry changes, and a few show command lines executed in PowerShell.\n\nI notice that many entries have similar information repeated. There's a pattern where the same command line is used multiple times in the process field. The commands involve creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" using powershell.exe with specific parameters like -Name and -BinaryPathName. This repetition makes me think that these are part of an automated script or perhaps an attack sequence where the attacker is setting up a persistent backdoor or malicious service.\n\nThe first entry has some complex JSON in the process field, which includes various details like command line arguments and file paths. It looks like the script is creating a new service with the binary path pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". The fact that this path is repeated suggests it's part of the same attack vector.\n\nAnother point I'm noticing is the use of svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process. Malware often uses svchost to hide their activities because it's a legitimate system process. So seeing svchost.exe being created or modified in the registry could indicate malicious activity trying to blend in with normal processes.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, there are mentions of tasks like \"Process Create\", \"Registry value set\", and various \"Provider Lifecycle\" events. These seem like generic Windows event logs, but when combined with the process information, they can provide context about what's happening on the system. For instance, a Process Create event for svchost.exe could be normal or it could signal that something malicious is starting.\n\nThe file field is mostly None in these entries, which might mean that either no files were involved in those particular events, or perhaps the logs don't capture file information. However, given that some command lines involve writing to specific paths, I would expect to see more file-related data if this was part of a broader log set.\n\nI'm also noticing that many entries repeat the same PowerShell command multiple times. This repetition might be an attempt to ensure the service is created and started every time the system boots or as part of a persistence mechanism. The fact that it's using New-Service and Start-Service suggests that the attackers are trying to create a new service in the system, possibly to run malicious code at startup.\n\nThe last few entries show PowerShell commands with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted, which is interesting because scripts typically require execution policy settings to run. If the policy is restricted, it might prevent script execution unless specifically allowed. However, in these logs, the command seems to be running successfully, so perhaps the attacker has already adjusted the execution policy or is using a different technique to bypass restrictions.\n\nI'm also wondering about the binary path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". If I were investigating this, I would check if that file actually exists on the system and whether it's executing legitimate code or something malicious. The name \"tarefa_logico\" translates to \"logical task\" in Portuguese, which is a bit generic but could be part of a custom tool.\n\nAnother angle is looking at how these processes are being created. If svchost.exe is being spawned by another process, especially through PowerShell, it might be indicative of a service or remote thread injection technique used by malware to maintain persistence.\n\nIn summary, putting this together, I think the logs show an attack where attackers are using PowerShell scripts to create and start a new service (objeto_ativo) that points to a potentially malicious executable. They're leveraging svchost.exe as a process name, possibly to hide their activities, and ensuring that their script runs at each system startup by creating a persistent service.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of these logs being part of an active attack or post-attack activity where attackers are setting up backdoors and persistence mechanisms. The repeated use of the same command line suggests automation, maybe via a script that's run multiple times to ensure it takes effect even if some attempts fail.\n\nTo confirm this analysis, I would need to look at more logs to see if there are other indicators like network connections, changes in file hashes, or other process activities. Additionally, checking the system's service list for \"objeto_ativo\" and ensuring that it's not running malicious code would be crucial steps in verifying this assessment.\n\nI'm also thinking about how an analyst might approach this. They would likely use tools like Process Monitor to capture detailed process creation events, check the registry for new services, analyze the binary file for malware indicators, and look into PowerShell execution policies and history to see if these commands were run intentionally or maliciously.\n\nOverall, while I can't be certain without more data, the patterns in these logs strongly suggest that there's some form of unauthorized system activity, likely involving the creation of a malicious service using svchost.exe as a front.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided logs suggests a potential security incident where attackers are attempting to establish persistence on the system. Here's a concise summary and conclusion:\n\n1. **Process Activity**: The logs show repeated use of PowerShell commands to create and start a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with the binary path pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". This suggests an attempt to install a persistent backdoor.\n\n2. **svchost.exe Usage**: The creation of svchost.exe processes is notable, as this process is often used by malware to hide malicious activities, indicating possible efforts to evade detection.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Events indicate registry changes, likely to ensure the service starts at boot, a common technique for persistence in attacks.\n\n4. **PowerShell Commands**: The repeated execution of similar commands suggests automation or script-based attack methods, possibly using known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain access and maintain presence.\n\n5. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - New service \"objeto_ativo\" with an unusual path.\n   - svchost.exe spawned by non-standard processes.\n   - Repeated attempts to create services or modify system configurations.\n\n**Conclusion**: The logs indicate a potential attack where attackers are using known techniques to establish persistence. Immediate steps should include verifying the existence and nature of \"tarefa_logico.exe\", checking for unauthorized services, and securing PowerShell execution policies. Further investigation with tools like Process Monitor and analysis of network traffic would be essential to confirm and mitigate the threat."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So I've been given a set of system log events in JSONL format, and my job is to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at the first few events, it seems like there's a pattern where `powershell.exe` is being executed with specific commands. The command lines are either writing a message to the host or doing some file operations on system files.\n\nStarting with the initial two events:\n1. `command_line` shows `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`, which just outputs text.\n2. Then, there's another event with the same command line but under different log tasks.\n\nThen I notice that from the third event onwards, the command lines change. They're querying the system's INF files in the Windows directory and checking for specific patterns. The script is looking through these files to see if they contain certain install sections. If it finds any, it sets `$Res` to 1 and exits.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit concerning because accessing system files like INF can be part of malicious activities, such as installing drivers or components without proper authorization. Also, the repeated execution of this script multiple times (I count about seven events with similar commands) might indicate testing or trying different approaches to ensure the script runs successfully across various environments.\n\nThe use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is meant to restrict PowerShell's capabilities, but sometimes attackers use it to prevent certain cmdlet executions that could be monitored. However, in this case, since they're using `Write-Host`, which doesn't require any privileged operations, maybe it's just a way to avoid detection or logging anomalies.\n\nAnother point to consider: the task names are either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are related to Windows event logs and their providers. If these tasks are being logged with such scripts, it might be part of legitimate system checks, but repeated attempts could raise flags.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not look suspicious on their own, the pattern of multiple PowerShell executions targeting system files with a focus on detecting specific patterns suggests potential malicious intent. This could indicate an attempt to check for vulnerabilities or configurations that could be exploited. Therefore, this batch should definitely be looked into.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions accessing system files and checking for specific patterns may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
