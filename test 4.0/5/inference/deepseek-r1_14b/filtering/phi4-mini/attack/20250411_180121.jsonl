{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. There are 18 entries here, each with process details, Windows log tasks, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events involve `chrome.exe` making network connections. While Chrome is a common browser, repeated connection attempts without a clear purpose could be suspicious. However, sometimes browsers do make many DNS queries and connections, especially when browsing the web heavily.\n\nThen, there's significant activity from `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused by attackers. Looking at the command lines, I see that it's downloading files from GitHub repositories. The paths in the URLs are pointing to different projects like 'modulo_temporario' and 'estrutura_temporario', which seem to suggest some organized structure or modules.\n\nThe events show file creations and deletions in temporary directories. For example, creating a script in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` and then deleting it shortly after might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving long-term traces. The fact that multiple such files are created and deleted could be part of a larger script or payload delivery.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry changes (Registry value set) and image loads within PowerShell processes. This could be part of the attack chainâ€”perhaps the scripts are attempting persistence by modifying system configurations.\n\nPutting this together, the combination of downloading files from potentially malicious domains, using PowerShell for execution, and evidence of file manipulation in temp directories suggests a high risk of malicious activity. The confidence level is high because multiple red flags align with common attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including downloading files from GitHub repositories, creating and deleting temporary files, registry modifications, and repeated network connections indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if there's anything interesting here that might indicate malicious activity. Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. The 'winlog' field seems to provide information about the type of task or rule triggered, like 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's a PowerShell process with a command line that includes downloading a file from a GitHub repository into the TEMP directory. The URL is pointing to \"objeto_padrao\/registro_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\". I know that downloading files via PowerShell can be legitimate, but sometimes it's used for malicious purposes like downloading payloads or scripts.\n\nThe second event is another PowerShell command with a similar structure, downloading from a different GitHub path into TEMP. This repetition of downloading from GitHub using PowerShell might raise an eyebrow. It seems suspicious because attackers often use such tools to execute arbitrary commands and download malicious files.\n\nNext, there's an event where the task is 'Pipe Created' related to PowerShell. That could be normal for legitimate scripts or remote sessions but could also be part of communication channels used by malware.\n\nThen, there are a few events from chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry, repeated writes might not be unusual unless they're attempting to modify restricted areas or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother event involves MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. A network connection detected by this process could be normal as it's part of the antivirus scanning. However, sometimes attackers might abuse legitimate services like Defender for their activities.\n\nThere are a couple of events from winlogbeat.exe creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is an ELK stack tool used for log shipping, so unless there's something odd about how it's being used here, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, there are processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe setting registry values, which seems within their normal operations. Calc.exe loading a system DLL is also standard, so that shouldn't raise flags.\n\nBut circling back to the PowerShell events, especially the ones downloading files from GitHub into TEMP. The combination of using powershell.exe with download commands is a common tactic for attackers. Using GitHub as a source could be an attempt to bypass traditional file scanning by downloading scripts or tools directly. The fact that there are multiple such events (three in total) suggests a possible script execution, maybe even part of a larger campaign.\n\nAdditionally, the files being created in TEMP and other user directories might indicate that these downloads are meant to be executed or written to disk without proper permissions, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity. Malicious actors often use such methods to drop payloads or create persistence points.\n\nThe justification here would be the multiple PowerShell download attempts from external sources, especially GitHub, combined with file creation events in sensitive areas like TEMP and user directories. This pattern suggests possible unauthorized access or script execution, which could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell processes downloading files from external sources (GitHub) into the TEMP directory, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My goal is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually to understand what's happening on the system. Each line represents an event with process information, Windows log task details, and file data. Since there are multiple events, I need to see if they collectively indicate malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that 'svchost.exe' is involved in several registry value sets. SvChost.exe is a legitimate system process, often associated with services, but it's commonly targeted by malware because of its reputation as a safe executable. However, multiple registry changes might be a red flag if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nNext, I see 'powershell.exe' appearing several times with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is powerful and often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly abused by attackers for command execution and persistence. The combination of accessing processes and modifying the registry could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times. While whoami is a standard tool to check user information, repeated usage without clear reason might warrant closer look. Also, cmd.exe is used with commands like SCHTASKS to delete tasks and REG DELETE to remove registry entries. These actions are concerning because attackers often clean up traces of their activities by deleting scheduled tasks or registry keys.\n\nThe use of 'schtasks.exe' for deletion suggests an attempt to remove scheduled tasks, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. Additionally, 'reg.exe' is used to delete registry entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This specific location is where Windows stores the names of executable files that are automatically started when logging on. Deleting entries here might indicate an attempt to remove persistence by removing autorun programs.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances where 'conhost.exe' is involved in registry changes. Conhost.exe is another legitimate process but can be used maliciously for command-line attacks or to host malicious payloads.\n\nPutting this all together: there are several red flags:\n\n1. **Multiple Registry Modifications:** The batch shows numerous events where processes like svchost.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe are modifying the registry. These modifications include deletions of specific entries under HKCU\\Run, which is a common technique for removing traces of malware.\n\n2. **Abuse of Legitimate Tools:** PowerShell and cmd.exe are being used to execute commands that have malicious intent. For example, using SCHTASKS to delete tasks could be part of an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms, and the repeated use of whoami might indicate credential-dumping or lateral movement attempts.\n\n3. **Process Accessing and Creation Events:** There's a pattern where processes access others (ProcessAccess) and create new ones (ProcessCreate). This could be indicative of process injection or spawning additional malicious processes.\n\n4. **Use of Multiple Tools:** The combination of svchost.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and reg.exe being used together suggests a possible script or automated attack. Attackers often use multiple tools to achieve their objectives, making it harder to detect each individual tool's misuse but more concerning when combined.\n\n5. **Potential Cleanup Activities:** The deletion of tasks and registry entries could be part of an attacker's cleanup phase after initial compromise. This makes the entire batch suspicious as it indicates post-exploitation activities rather than normal system operations.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if these activities could be legitimate. For example, a system administrator might run scripts that use these tools to manage tasks and registry settings. But given the volume and specific actions (like repeated deletions of specific entries), it's less likely to be benign. Additionally, the use of multiple different processes and tools in quick succession raises suspicion.\n\nI should also look for signs of persistence mechanisms. Deleting entries from HKCU\\Run suggests that something was there before and is now being removed, possibly to cover tracks. The deletion of scheduled tasks using SCHTASKS could indicate removal of persistent scripts or malware that runs at startup.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple indicators of potential malicious activity, including misuse of legitimate tools, registry modifications, process accesses, and possible cleanup actions. While it's possible these activities are part of legitimate system administration, the combination and specific actions strongly suggest they might be part of a cyberattack.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits multiple indicators of potential malicious activity, making it highly suspicious for investigation. Key points include:\n\n1. **Registry Modifications:** Numerous events show processes modifying the registry, particularly deleting entries under HKCU\\Run, which is often used by malware for persistence.\n\n2. **Abuse of Legitimate Tools:** The use of tools like PowerShell, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe suggests possible malicious intent, as these are commonly exploited for command execution and cleanup.\n\n3. **Process Activities:** Events involving ProcessAccess and ProcessCreate indicate potential process injection or spawning of additional processes, which can be signs of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Cleanupè¿¹è±¡:** The deletion of tasks and registry entries points to post-exploitation activities, where attackers remove traces to avoid detection.\n\n5. **Use of Multiple Tools:** The combination of various tools suggests a coordinated attack, making the batch more suspicious than isolated incidents.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given these factors, the batch is highly indicative of malicious behavior and warrants further investigation."}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so that immediately catches my attention. The fact that it's appearing multiple times suggests possible automation or something being triggered repeatedly.\n\nLooking at the details, there are tasks like 'Process Create' and 'Registry value set'. These can be part of normal operations, but they're also red flags because attackers often use these actions to establish persistence or modify system configurations. For example, creating a new process for powershell.exe multiple times might indicate an attempt to run scripts that shouldn't be there.\n\nI also see several file-related events, like 'File created' and 'File Delete logged'. Creating temporary files, especially with random names like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1', could be a sign of script execution. The fact that the file is deleted shortly after might be an attempt to remove traces, which is common in malware.\n\nAnother point is the 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes are often used for interprocess communication, and attackers might use them to create covert channels or to hide their commands.\n\nThere's also a mention of conhost.exe and whoami.exe being executed. While whoami.exe is usually benign, its execution can sometimes be part of privilege escalation or information gathering. The combination with powershell.exe could indicate an attempt to run scripts under different permissions.\n\nThe repeated registry modifications are concerning because attackers often set or delete registry keys to maintain persistence or alter system behavior. Each 'Registry value set' event might be part of setting up a startup script or modifying policies that allow continued access.\n\nAdditionally, the variety of image loads from System32 and other directories could be indicative of loading malicious modules or legitimate ones. However, combined with all the other events, it raises suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe with various system interactions, file operations, and registry changes. These activities don't seem to fit a normal user's behavior, especially when considering the frequency and types of operations. The potential for these actions being part of an attack chain is high, such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because there are multiple red flags that together suggest possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and pipe creation indicate potential malicious activities such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing some system log event. The goal is to determine if the entire batch should be looked into for potential malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one and noting down the key details like the process name, the task or action performed, and any associated files.\n\n1. **Event 1**: cmd.exe sets a registry value.\n2. **Event 2**: Same as above, another cmd.exe.\n3. **Event 3**: conhost.exe does the same thingâ€”sets a registry value.\n4. **Event 4**: powershell.exe accesses something.\n5. **Event 5**: whoami.exe is run with its command line; seems normal for checking user info.\n6. **Event 6**: Another powershell.exe access.\n7. **Event 7**: powershell.exe sets a registry value.\n8. **Event 8**: Powershell is created with an empty command, which might be suspicious but not always bad.\n9. **Events 9-10**: More ProcessAccess and Registry set actions by powershell.exe.\n10. **Events 11-13**: Powershell loads various .NET librariesâ€”this can be normal or part of malicious script execution.\n11. **Events 14-17**: Provider Lifecycle tasks, perhaps related to event tracing or PowerShell's own events. Not sure if these are common or not.\n12. **Event 18**: Powershell creates a file in the Temp directory named with a random-looking name.\n13. **Event 19**: Same powershell deletes that temp file immediately after creating it.\n14. **Events 20-23**: Registry sets and pipes created by both powershell.exe and chrome.exe.\n\nNow, thinking about potential red flags:\n\n- The repeated use of cmd.exe and conhost.exe to set registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms. Malware often uses registry modifications to ensure it runs on startup.\n- The multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing and modifying the registry might indicate script execution or command-line attacks. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n- The creation and deletion of a temp file by powershell could be part of script execution where temporary files are created, executed, then deleted to cover tracks.\n- The pipe creation eventsâ€”these can allow inter-process communication, which might be used for command-and-control or data exfiltration.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these activities could also be benign. For example, legitimate scripts using powershell.exe might create and delete temp files. Similarly, registry modifications aren't always malicious; they can be part of software installations or configurations.\n\nHowever, the combination here seems concerning. The repeated registry writes from different processes (cmd, conhost, powershell) suggest a coordinated effort, possibly to establish persistence across reboots. Additionally, the powershell.exe creating and then deleting a temp file quickly could indicate an attempt to run a script without leaving evidence on disk for long.\n\nThe use of \"powershell.exe & {}\" in command lines looks unusual. Typically, when you see \"&\", it's used in batch files or command chaining, but in this context, it might be part of obfuscation techniques to make the process name less obvious or execute multiple commands.\n\nI'm also noting that the events involve various components: cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and even Calculator.exe. The latter is unexpected hereâ€”why would Calculator set a registry value? That seems odd unless it's part of some exploit or persistence mechanism.\n\nPutting all this together, while there might be some legitimate activities, the overall pattern suggests potential malicious behavior. Multiple processes modifying the registry could indicate installation of malware components, and the powershell activities with temp files and pipes are red flags for script execution and possible data transfer.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several concerning patterns that suggest potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Registry Modifications**: cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe repeatedly set registry values, which could be part of persistence mechanisms to ensure malware runs on startup.\n\n2. **Powershell Activities**: The creation and deletion of a temp file by powershell.exe indicates possible script execution aimed at avoiding detection by quickly removing evidence.\n\n3. **Command-Line Red Flags**: The use of \"powershell.exe & {}\" in command lines suggests obfuscation techniques, possibly to execute commands stealthily.\n\n4. **Unexpected Processes**: The involvement of Calculator.exe setting registry values is unusual and could indicate an exploit or persistence method.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**: Events involving pipe creation by powershell.exe and chrome.exe might facilitate inter-process communication, potentially for command-and-control or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile some activities could be benign, the combination of these events suggests a coordinated effort indicative of malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch should be investigated further to assess potential threats.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events are considered **interesting** and warrant closer examination due to the patterns indicative of possible malicious activity."}

I notice some command lines like \"& {}\" and later \"& {Remove-Item...}\". The latter looks suspicious as it's deleting files in the TEMP directory without clear justification.\n\nThere are file creation and deletion events involving PowerShell scripts, which could be part of malicious activity like script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nRegistry modifications by PowerShell might indicate tampering with system configurations or creating persistence points.\n\nThe deletion of files in the TEMP directory and the use of specific command lines raise red flags.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being run with commands that remove files from the TEMP directory. Each command is using Remove-Item to delete specific .zip or .txt files in $env:TEMP. This seems suspicious because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement or to execute malicious scripts. The fact that they're deleting temporary files could be an attempt to cover their tracks or clean up after some activity.\n\nThen there are events where Chrome.exe is involved, but those seem normalâ€”loading system DLLs and registry operations. Nothing unusual there, so probably not a red flag.\n\nLooking further down, I see instances of whoami.exe being executed. That's a common tool used to check user privileges or identify the current user. In some cases, this could be part of legitimate activity, but in others, it might indicate reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that there are multiple PowerShell processes accessing the registry and creating files. This could be normal admin tasks, but considering the file deletions earlier, it adds to the concern. The fact that several events have 'ErrorAction Ignore' suggests they're trying to run commands without showing errors, which might indicate they're hiding failed attempts.\n\nPutting this all together: repeated deletion of TEMP files by PowerShell, registry accesses, and using whoami.exe could be signs of malicious activity. The combination of these actions over multiple events raises the suspicion that something fishy is going on. However, I'm not entirely sure if each individual action is inherently bad or just part of legitimate processes.\n\nSo, after considering all the events together, there's enough concerning behavior to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are deleting files from the TEMP directory, which may indicate malicious activity or attempt to remove evidence.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this analysis. I've been given a batch of log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nLooking at the first few logs, I notice that there are multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers. The events show `Image loaded` tasks with various DLLs. This isn't immediately suspicious on its own, as powershell loads many modules.\n\nHowever, the logs then mention a file creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1`). Temporary files are common in scripting but can also be indicators of malicious activity, especially when combined with deletions to cover tracks. This is a red flag.\n\nNext, there are several `Remove-Item` commands executed via powershell.exe, targeting temporary files. Attackers might delete logs or evidence, so these deletions could be part of an attempt to erase their footprints. Also, the repetitive removal of specific files like `estrutura_padrao.txt` and `pacote_ativo.txt` seems unusual unless it's part of a cleanup routine.\n\nAnother point is the use of `whoami.exe`, which could be used to gather system information. While benign on its own, in combination with other actions, it might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThere are also registry access events from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe, along with chrome.exe accessing the registry multiple times. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so this could be concerning.\n\nThe presence of `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file seems normal unless it's related to log tampering, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering all these events togetherâ€”script creation\/deletion, file removals, registry changesâ€”it's plausible that malicious activity is occurring. The repetitive and targeted actions might be part of an attack chain, making the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including script creation, deletion, and file removals indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where 'chrome.exe' is setting registry values. This seems normal because Chrome often makes changes to the registry for settings and extensions. But I should keep an eye on how many times this happens; too many could be suspicious, but a few might just be regular activity.\n\nNext, there's 'RuntimeBroker.exe' doing a registry set. Runtime Broker is part of Windows, so it shouldn't raise flags unless it's doing something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nThen I notice several events involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement, but not every use is malicious. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might warrant closer inspection. Also, when combined with other processes like 'whoami.exe', which was created and run from the system32 directory, there could be potential privilege escalation or information gathering activities.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is used to get user information, so running this as part of a script could indicate an attempt to gather credentials or system details. The command line shows it's being executed directly, which might not be standard if the user isn't expected to run such commands frequently.\n\nThere's also an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in its data directory. WinlogBeat is likely part of the logging setup and shouldn't be concerning on its own. However, the path mentioned seems normal, so no immediate issues there.\n\nFinally, another PowerShell instance created a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename doesn't immediately ring any bells, but creating files with arbitrary names could be part of data exfiltration or storing malicious scripts. Without knowing what's inside this file, it's hard to say for sure, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of Registry changes by Chrome and RuntimeBroker are probably benign. The repeated use of PowerShell along with creating files and running whoami.exe might indicate malicious activity like script execution or information gathering. Therefore, the batch as a whole is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, registry modifications by chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, and file creation activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or suspicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
