PowerShell usage often signifies administrative activity or scripting, which can be benign but is commonly exploited for malicious purposes. The repeated use of chrome.exe to set registry values raises flags due to its typical user-oriented nature and potential exploitation via extension or script injection. Additionally, there are multiple instances of process creation and image loading events involving tasklist.exe and known Windows Defender components (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which could suggest an investigation into whether these activities are legitimate checks by security software or attempts at evasion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
