However, it should not typically be deleting files in the manner described.\n\n2. **Action Observed**:\n   - All events report file deletions (`File Delete logged`) with the same rule `FileDeleteDetected`.\n   - The deletion of multiple DLL files from a specific temporary directory is unusual for typical operations performed by Dism.exe, which could indicate tampering or misuse (e.g., an attacker using Dism.exe to mask malicious activity).\n\n3. **Pattern and Context**:\n   - All deletions occur in the same directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`), suggesting a coordinated activity rather than isolated incidents.\n   - The presence of multiple DLL files with descriptive names (e.g., `FfuProvider.dll`, `ImagingProvider.dll`) suggests that these could be components related to image servicing or deployment, which might have been manipulated.\n\n4. **Potential Security Implications**:\n   - If Dism.exe is being misused to delete important files as part of an attack, it could lead to system instability, data loss, or further exploitation.\n   - The activity could be indicative of an attacker trying to cover tracks or interfere with legitimate processes.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**:\n   - Given the unusual nature of these deletions by a legitimate utility and the potential for security implications, there is high confidence in classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation.\n\nThis analysis concludes that the events are anomalous enough to warrant closer scrutiny due to the potential risks involved."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data appears to represent a series of events related to processes and activities on a Windows system, specifically focusing on PowerShell commands for service creation. Here's an analysis of the key points:\n\n1. **Service Creation with PowerShell**:\n   - Multiple entries describe the execution of PowerShell scripts designed to create and start services named \"objeto_ativo\". These scripts use `New-Service` to define a new Windows service, specifying its name and binary path as `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - The command line used is: \n     ```powershell\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - This pattern repeats several times, indicating multiple instances of the same command being executed.\n\n2. **Lifecycle Events**:\n   - The logs also include lifecycle events for a provider and an engine, possibly relating to monitoring or automation frameworks that manage these services.\n   - Commands are executed with PowerShell execution policy set to \"Restricted\", which is typically used to prevent scripts from running without explicit permission. The commands execute a simple command `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`.\n\n3. **Windows Update Agent**:\n   - There's an entry for the Windows Update Agent, suggesting that updates are being processed or checked during this time frame.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Events**:\n   - Other entries log standard Windows events such as a process creation (services.exe), image loading (`taskschd.dll` by svchost.exe), and registry value changes.\n   \n5. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - Repeated execution of PowerShell commands to create services could be indicative of benign automation or potentially malicious activity if unauthorized or unexpected.\n   - The use of \"objeto_ativo\" as a service name may need further investigation to ensure it aligns with organizational policies and expected behavior.\n\n6. **File Paths and Services**:\n   - The path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is significant, as it's used repeatedly for the binary path of created services. Monitoring or auditing access to this directory could provide insights into whether these activities are legitimate.\n\nIn summary, while some of these events might be part of normal administrative tasks, others warrant further investigation, especially those involving repeated service creation and PowerShell execution with restricted policies. It’s crucial to verify that all such operations comply with security policies and organizational standards."}
