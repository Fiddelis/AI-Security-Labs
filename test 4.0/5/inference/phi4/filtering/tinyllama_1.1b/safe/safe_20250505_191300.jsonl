This could be related to legitimate functionality associated with software integrations or features within Discord.\n\n4. **No Indications of Malicious Activity**: There are no indications of unusual paths, unexpected binaries, unauthorized accesses outside known directories, or other events that typically suggest malicious behavior.\n\nGiven the nature and context of these logs, there is a high level of confidence in concluding that the batch does not warrant further investigation for malicious activity."}
