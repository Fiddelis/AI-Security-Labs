However, the repeated creation of similar files under this context could be suspicious.\n\n4. **Potential Security Implications**: While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft services, its behavior in creating multiple identical files without clear necessity may suggest either an error or malicious activity such as attempting to inject code or create backdoors.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: The confidence level of 0.85 reflects the potential seriousness of duplicate file creation by a known system process, but acknowledges that further investigation is needed to confirm if this behavior is benign or malicious."}
