Additionally, multiple registry value changes associated with both benign processes (e.g., 'notepad.exe') and system-critical processes (e.g., 'svchost.exe', 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe') indicate potential unauthorized configuration modifications. The repeated registry changes involving 'chrome.exe' further raise suspicion of possible malware behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
