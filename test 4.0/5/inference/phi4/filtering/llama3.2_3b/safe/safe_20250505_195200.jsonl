This executable might not be a standard Microsoft process; thus, it warrants further investigation to confirm its legitimacy.\n\n2. **File Path and Patterns**: All file creation events occur within the same directory path, specifically under `SolutionPackages\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles`, which suggests organized activity potentially related to Office solutions or add-ons.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries with Different Hashes**: There are entries for files like `excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_cae61a256865f559df4b5852830ad9c5.js` and `e241a20b2a440aed924726cf09b0dd0e.js` that appear more than once with different hashes. This behavior is unusual for benign processes, as legitimate file creation should maintain consistency unless explicitly intended (such as versioning or updates).\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Indicators**: The presence of multiple files with similar names but differing content (as indicated by hash differences) might imply attempts to inject malicious scripts into an environment under the guise of legitimate operations.\n\nGiven these observations, this batch warrants further investigation to rule out any unauthorized file modifications or potential compromise activities. The confidence level is set at 0.85 due to these multiple indicators, which collectively suggest unusual behavior but are not definitively conclusive without additional context."}
