The creation of TypeScript definition files (`*.d.ts`) in the `node_modules` directory under a project related to Cypress is an expected activity when developers are setting up or maintaining their projects. This is particularly relevant as it involves the use of Git, a version control system, which aligns with standard procedures for managing changes to code bases.\n\nThe repeated creation of similar files by 'git.exe' suggests that these events were part of a continuous integration\/continuous deployment (CI\/CD) process or local development workflow. Since all file paths share a common directory structure and involve the same application ('git.exe'), there is no indication of anomalous behavior such as the presence of files outside expected directories, irregular access patterns, or the use of unexpected executables.\n\nGiven this context, there are no signs of malicious activity within these logs, leading to high confidence in classifying them as \"NOT INTERESTING\" for further investigation."}
