{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE and an unusual DLL load suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repeated User Account Management Events:** The batch contains several events related to user account management, which are typical but do not inherently indicate suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **EXCEL.EXE Activity:**\n   - There is an event where `coml2.dll` was loaded by EXCEL.EXE, a DLL associated with known malware (Emotet). This alone raises suspicion.\n   - The repeated DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE are unusual for typical Excel usage and may indicate communication with command-and-control servers.\n\n3. **File Creation Events:**\n   - Two events show the creation of a `.LNK` file (`real_values.csv.LNK`) by EXCEL.EXE, which could be an attempt at persistence or deception (using LNK files to execute commands).\n\n4. **Null Process and Task Entries:** Several entries with null process names and tasks are not inherently suspicious but might suggest incomplete logging.\n\nGiven these factors, the combination of unusual EXCEL.EXE behavior (DLL loading, DNS queries) warrants further investigation for potential malicious activity. The confidence level reflects a high degree of suspicion based on known indicators of compromise."}
