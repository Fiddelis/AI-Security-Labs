{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a JSON output from an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) system, likely Malwarebytes. The output contains various security-related events in the following format:\n\n```\n{\"process\": \"...\", \"winlog\": \"...\", \"file\": \"...\"}\n```\n\nHere's what each section represents:\n\n1. **process**: Information about a running process on the system.\n\t* Typically includes process name, PID (Process ID), and possibly other details like path or command line arguments.\n2. **winlog**: Windows event logs related to security events.\n\t* Includes task names, which correspond to specific rules within the EDR system, such as \"Process Create\", \"Registry value set\", etc.\n3. **file**: Information about files involved in security-related events (e.g., when a file is executed or accessed).\n\t* Typically includes path and possibly other details like hash or size.\n\nLet's break down each event:\n\n**Event 1**\n```\n{\"process\": \"{'name': 'wininit.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nThis event indicates that a process named `wininit.exe` was created on the system. This is a legitimate Windows process responsible for initializing the system.\n\n**Event 2**\n```\n{\"process\": \"{'name': 'services.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nIn this event, a process named `services.exe` is involved in setting a registry value on the system. This could be related to a legitimate service configuration change.\n\n**Event 3**\n```\n{\"process\": \"{'name': 'sppsvc.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll'}\"}\n```\n\nHere, a process named `sppsvc.exe` loads an image (`taskschd.dll`) from the system directory. This is likely related to a legitimate Windows service.\n\n**Event 4**\n```\n{\"process\": \"None\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Windows Update Agent'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nThis event indicates that the Windows Update agent has performed some action on the system ( likely updating the system), but there's no information about which process was involved or any related files.\n\n**Event 5**\n```\n{\"process\": \"None\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'None'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nThis event simply indicates that there were no security-related events logged at this time.\n\nIn summary, these events provide insight into various system activities and processes running on the system, along with related Windows event logs."}
