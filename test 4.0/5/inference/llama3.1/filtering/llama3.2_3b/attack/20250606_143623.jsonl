{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"A collection of JSON objects that represent security-related events on a Windows system. Each object has three main keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\".\n\n1. **process**: This key contains information about the process involved in the event, such as its command line. If no process is associated with the event, it's set to \"None\".\n2. **winlog**: This key stores Windows security log data, which includes details about the task or action that triggered the event (e.g., a process creation). If there's no relevant log information, it's set to an empty dictionary or \"{'task': 'None'}\".\n3. **file**: This key is usually empty, as it doesn't seem to be used in these specific examples.\n\nHere are some insights from analyzing the provided JSON objects:\n\n* The first object has a null value for both process and file keys, while winlog indicates an unknown or unidentified task.\n* Subsequent objects all have a process associated with them. This process is running PowerShell commands that create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" with the executable path set to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`, and then start this service.\n* The winlog key remains consistent across all these objects, indicating a task related to provider lifecycle management.\n\nGiven this context, it appears that an attacker or malicious actor has created a Windows service to run a specific executable (`tarefa_logico.exe`) on the compromised system."}
