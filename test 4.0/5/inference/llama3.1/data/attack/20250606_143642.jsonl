{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log file from an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) system, specifically from the \"sysmon\" tool. Sysmon is a Windows service that logs various events on a Windows system, including process creation, registry modifications, file access, and more.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the fields in each log entry:\n\n1. **process**: This field contains information about the process that triggered the event.\n\t* **name**: The name of the process (e.g., \"powershell.exe\").\n\t* **command_line**: The command-line arguments passed to the process (e.g., `\\\"powershell.exe\\\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`).\n2. **winlog**: This field contains information about the Windows event that triggered the log entry.\n\t* **task**: A brief description of the event (e.g., \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\", \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\").\n\nThe other two fields, **file** and **time**, are not present in all log entries. When they are present, **file** contains information about a file that was accessed or modified by the process:\n\n* **path**: The full path to the file on disk.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can see that there are several suspicious events logged, including:\n\n1. A malicious PowerShell script being executed (`powershell.exe` with command-line arguments).\n2. Registry values being set (potentially for malicious purposes).\n3. Files being created or deleted (which may be part of a malware's payload).\n\nTo provide more context and insight into these events, I would recommend analyzing the log entries in detail, considering factors such as:\n\n* The specific rules that triggered each event (e.g., \"ProcessCreate\", \"RegistryEvent\").\n* The command-line arguments passed to `powershell.exe`.\n* The files being created or deleted.\n* Any other relevant system logs or indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\nIf you're investigating a specific security incident, I'd be happy to help with further analysis and context!"}
