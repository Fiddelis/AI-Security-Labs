{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess and ProcessCreate. The command_line in one of the cmd.exe entries stands out: it's using sc create to set up a service with a binPath that includes starting a PowerShell script. The script path is \"c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\" and another one \"c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The filenames have \"NonExistingScript\" in them, which might be a red flag. Typically, attackers might use non-existent files to avoid detection, but maybe that's just a naming convention here. However, creating a service with a command that starts a script could be suspicious.\n\nAnother entry shows sc.exe creating a service with a similar command. The use of sc.exe to create a service is normal, but combining it with starting a script might be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the fact that there are multiple registry value set events from services.exe and other processes could indicate attempts to modify system settings, which is often seen in malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's an ImageLoad event for urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a sign of something. However, there are two entries here, and since urlmon.dll is part of Windows, it's hard to say without more context.\n\nThe presence of 'whoami.exe' is normal, as it's used to check user context. But when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nI also notice that some entries have \"None\" for process or file, which might be missing data, but not necessarily malicious. However, the repeated registry changes and service creation attempts are more concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of services with PowerShell scripts, multiple registry modifications, and the use of sc.exe could indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system. Even though some elements are normal, the combination and frequency of these events might be indicative of malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Use of 'sc create' to register a service with a command that executes a PowerShell script (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), which may indicate persistence attempts. 2) Repeated registry modification events from services.exe and other processes, suggesting potential system configuration changes. 3) PowerShell and cmd.exe process creation with no clear benign context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The main thing is to look for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry one by one. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the path is in the user's Downloads folder, which could be okay if it's part of an installation. However, sometimes malicious software might drop files there. Not sure yet, but maybe not a red flag on its own.\n\nNext, ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That's part of the Windows shell, so maybe normal. Then Calculator.exe and PowerShell.exe also setting registry values. PowerShell is common for both legitimate and malicious activities. But just setting registry values isn't necessarily bad. However, when combined with other events, it might be more telling.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there's a Process accessed event. That could be normal, but if it's accessing processes that aren't expected, that's a problem. Then Chrome.exe has several registry value set events. Chrome is a common browser, but multiple registry changes might be unusual. Also, there are Image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows files, so loading them is normal. But maybe if they were loaded from unexpected locations, but here the paths look standard.\n\nWait, the ImageLoad events for Chrome are loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. So that's normal. Chrome might be interacting with these components, which is okay.\n\nNow, looking at all the events together. The first event is a file creation by winlogbeat, which might be part of a legitimate setup. The rest involve Chrome and PowerShell making registry changes and process access. However, the number of events related to Chrome and PowerShell might be higher than usual. But without more context, like if these events are part of a known benign process or if there's a pattern of unauthorized access, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut wait, the first event is a file created with a .yml.new extension. That's a configuration file, and the name suggests it's a new configuration. If winlogbeat is being configured, that's normal. However, if this is part of an installation or setup that's not expected, it might be suspicious. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThe other events involve registry changes and process access. If these are part of normal operations, like Chrome updating its settings or PowerShell running scripts, it's okay. However, if there's a pattern of unauthorized changes or access to sensitive processes, that's a problem. But in the given logs, there's no indication of that. The processes mentioned are all legitimate, and the files accessed are standard system files.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the events don't seem to indicate any malicious activity. The first event might be a normal configuration change, and the rest are typical system activities. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the high number of registry changes and process accesses is a red flag. However, without more context or anomalies, it's hard to classify this as interesting. The confidence is a bit low, but maybe around 0.4. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with a justification that the events are normal system activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect normal system operations (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation, Chrome and PowerShell registry modifications, legitimate DLL loading). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
