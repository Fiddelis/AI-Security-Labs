{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. First, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here. The majority of the events are related to normal processes like chrome.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe. However, I notice some entries involving cmd.exe and schtasks.exe.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entry with the command line, it's using schtasks to create scheduled tasks named things like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The commands are setting up tasks to run calc.exe on logon and startup. That seems odd because calc.exe is typically a harmless calculator, but when used in scheduled tasks, especially with system-level permissions, it might be a red flag. \n\nAnother point is the use of \"ru system\" in one of the schtasks commands, which means the task runs as the system user. That's a higher privilege level, which could be exploited if malicious. Also, multiple schtasks.exe processes are creating tasks, which could indicate an attempt to persist on the system.\n\nThere's also a file created at \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\" by svchost.exe. While svchost.exe is a normal system process, creating files in the System32 directory might be suspicious if it's not part of standard operations. However, System32 is a common location for system files, so I need to check if this is a legitimate task or not. The filename includes \"pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\" which seems like a random or possibly obfuscated name, which is suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry events and process accesses, but none of them immediately point to malware. However, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with system privileges and using calc.exe in that context might be part of a larger attack. The presence of multiple schtasks.exe instances and the creation of scheduled tasks with unusual names could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or execute commands under the radar.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The use of \"calc.exe\" is common, but in this context, it's being used as part of scheduled tasks, which is not typical. Also, the command lines have some obfuscation with the slashes and quotes, which might be an attempt to hide the true intent.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious activities are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with system-level permissions, the use of calc.exe in these tasks, and the creation of a file in the System32 directory with a suspiciously named task. These could be signs of an attacker trying to establish persistence on the system. However, without more context or additional indicators like unexpected network activity or unusual file modifications, it's a bit tricky. But the combination of these events does raise enough suspicion to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled tasks created via schtasks.exe with system-level permissions, including execution of calc.exe on logon\/startup. Unusual file creation in System32 directory and obfuscated task names suggest potential persistence mechanism or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and others. Now, svchost.exe is a normal Windows process, but if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be a red flag. However, in the logs here, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe with 'Registry value set' events. But I need to check if that's abnormal. However, without knowing the baseline, it's hard to say, but maybe the quantity is a clue.\n\nWait, there's an entry where a file is created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup'. Creating a task in the System32 directory could be a sign of persistence, like a scheduled task that's been added. That seems suspicious. The filename 'pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup' might be a made-up name, but maybe it's related to some malicious activity. Also, the user might be trying to set up something that runs automatically.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating a file called 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. Creating a text file isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern of malicious activity, it could be relevant. However, on its own, it's not a strong indicator.\n\nAnother point is that chrome.exe is loading some DLLs, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. But if chrome.exe is loading unexpected DLLs, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are legitimate, so that might be okay.\n\nLooking at the other entries, there's a lot of registry changes. If multiple processes are modifying the registry, that's not unusual, but if it's a single process doing a lot, that's more suspicious. However, the logs show that svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and others are all involved. But the key point is the file creation in the System32\\Tasks directory. That's a common place for malicious scheduled tasks.\n\nAlso, the fact that winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's just part of its normal operation. But the filename has a .yml.new extension, which might be a temporary file during configuration, so that's probably normal.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious event is the creation of the scheduled task file in System32\\Tasks. That's a high-risk area for persistence mechanisms. The other events might be normal, but this one stands out. So, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because of that specific file creation. The confidence is around 0.7 because while that event is suspicious, without more context, it's not definitive. But the presence of that file creation is a strong indicator that further investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A suspicious file was created in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup), which is a common indicator of malicious scheduled tasks or persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first six entries are all about chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a lot of registry changes by Chrome. But wait, Chrome is a common application, and it's possible that it legitimately modifies the registry during normal operations, like updates or configuration changes. However, multiple registry modifications could be a red flag if they're unexpected or part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's an entry for powershell.exe with \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a standard tool for administrators. The next event is whoami.exe being executed, which is a simple command that displays user information. That's usually benign, but if it's part of a sequence of commands, it might be used in an attack to check privileges.\n\nAnother PowerShell event follows, similar to the first one. Now, looking at the combination of events: multiple registry changes by Chrome, which might be normal, but then PowerShell being accessed and whoami.exe executed. The presence of PowerShell and whoami.exe could indicate someone trying to check system information, which isn't necessarily malicious, but when combined with other events, it might be suspicious.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if this is just normal user activity. For example, a user might be running Chrome and using PowerShell for legitimate tasks. But the repetition of registry events could be more concerning. However, since all the Chrome events are the same, maybe it's a false positive or a benign action. The whoami.exe is a low-risk command, but if it's part of a larger attack, like privilege escalation, it could be a sign. But with the given data, there's not enough evidence to confirm that.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events aren't clearly malicious, but there are some elements that could be part of an investigation. The presence of multiple registry changes and PowerShell access might warrant further look into, but without more context, like unusual command-line arguments or other suspicious processes, it's hard to say. So, I think the justification would be that there are multiple registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell activity, which could be benign but might require further investigation to rule out malicious intent. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because it's not a clear-cut case but has some elements that are worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and PowerShell process access events may indicate potential malicious activity, though further analysis is needed to confirm.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
