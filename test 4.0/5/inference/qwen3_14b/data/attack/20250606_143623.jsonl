So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' entries. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The events include things like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created and deleted, and Pipe Created. \n\nOne of the entries has a command line that stands out: \"New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" followed by Start-Service. This looks like someone is creating a new service with a custom executable. That's suspicious because creating a service with a non-standard path could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. \n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events pointing to various .dll files, some related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads, especially from unexpected locations, might indicate that the process is loading additional components that aren't standard. \n\nThe File Create and Delete events involve a temporary script file. Creating and then immediately deleting a script could be an attempt to obfuscate the presence of malicious code. However, PowerShell scripts are common, so this alone might not be conclusive. \n\nThe Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of a larger attack. \n\nAlso, the 'services.exe' entries have multiple Registry value set events. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, but if it's modifying registry values repeatedly, that might indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nPutting this all together: the creation of a new service with a custom binary, multiple image loads, and the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious commands like New-Service and Start-Service are red flags. These actions could be part of an attack where an adversary is establishing persistence on the system. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these events might be normal. For example, PowerShell is widely used, and image loads are part of normal operations. But the combination of creating a service, modifying the registry, and loading various DLLs might indicate a more complex scenario. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. There are enough suspicious activities to warrant further investigation, but without more context (like the content of the scripts or the behavior of the service), it's not definitive. So, I would classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., creating a new service with a custom binary path and starting it), loading numerous DLLs (including .NET and Windows Defender components), and creating\/deleting temporary scripts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: services.exe has a registry value set. That's normal, as services.exe is a legitimate Windows process. Then there's tarefa_logico.exe loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to the .NET Framework. Wait, tarefa_logico.exe isn't a standard Windows process. The name seems suspicious. The fact that it's loading multiple .NET DLLs might be normal if it's a .NET application, but the name doesn't ring a bell. However, the next entry is powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder. That's common for PowerShell profiles, but the second PowerShell event is a registry value set. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of services.exe and svchost.exe doing registry value sets. Those are typically legitimate, but the repetition might be a red flag. However, the main thing here is the tarefa_logico.exe process. The name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" doesn't seem right. Maybe it's a typo or a malicious file. Also, loading those .NET DLLs might be part of a legitimate application, but if it's not a known process, that's concerning.\n\nAnother point is the file created by PowerShell: StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's a normal PowerShell startup profile file. But the registry events from tarefa_logico.exe and the repeated registry changes by services.exe and svchost.exe could be part of something. However, without more context like unexpected network activity or unusual file modifications, it's hard to say. The presence of a non-standard process loading multiple DLLs and the repeated registry changes might indicate a potential issue. But I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. The MsMpEng.exe (Microsoft Defender) doing registry changes is normal. The logs don't show any obvious malware indicators like unexpected network connections or file deletions. \n\nSo the main red flags are the tarefa_logico.exe process and the multiple registry changes. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity beyond that, maybe it's not a high-confidence alert. However, the presence of an unknown process loading multiple .NET DLLs and the repetition of registry events could be worth investigating further. The confidence might be around 0.65.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of svchost.exe performing \"Registry value set\" tasks. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, repeated registry modifications could be a red flag, especially if they're part of a larger pattern. But on their own, these might not be suspicious. I need to check if there's more.\n\nThen, I see setup.exe creating several files in the Program Files (x86) directory under Microsoft EdgeCore. The files include msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others. Now, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. However, creating multiple executable files in a directory that's part of a software installation (like Edge) might be normal during an install. But wait, the path mentions \"EdgeCore\" and \"137.0.3296.62\", which looks like a specific version number. If this is part of a legitimate Edge update or installation, it's okay. But if not, it could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the file created at \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft\\\\EdgeCore\\\\137.0.3296.62\\\\Installer\\\\setup.exe\". This seems like a nested setup executable, which might be part of a staged installation. However, that's not necessarily bad. But combining this with the registry changes by svchost.exe could indicate something more.\n\nWait, there's also an event where setup.exe loads an image from taskschd.dll. Taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, so loading that might be normal during setup. But if an installer is modifying the registry and creating a lot of files, maybe it's a legitimate install. However, the repetition of registry changes by svchost.exe might be a sign of something else, like a persistence mechanism.\n\nBut here's the thing: svchost.exe is a common host process. If multiple registry keys are being set by it, but there's no other suspicious activity, it might just be part of normal system operations. However, when combined with setup.exe creating a bunch of files in a specific directory, it's possible that this is a legitimate software installation. But why are there so many registry changes?\n\nWait, maybe the setup.exe is part of a legitimate Microsoft Edge installation. The files being created are part of Edge's components. However, the presence of a batch file named \"show_third_party_software_licenses.bat\" might be normal for an installer to display licenses. But then again, that's not necessarily suspicious.\n\nAlternatively, if the setup.exe is not part of a legitimate installation, but rather a malicious payload, creating these files and modifying the registry could be part of a malware's behavior. However, without more context, like the source of the setup.exe, or other indicators like network activity, it's hard to tell. But the fact that the same process (setup.exe) is creating multiple files and the svchost.exe is modifying the registry multiple times might be a sign of something.\n\nBut considering that Microsoft Edge is a legitimate software, and the files being created are part of its installation, maybe this is just a normal install. However, the high number of registry changes by svchost.exe might be more than usual. But svchost.exe can host multiple services, so it's possible that during the installation, services are being configured, leading to registry changes.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the combination of these events is abnormal. If this is a fresh installation, then yes, it's normal. But if this is happening on a system that's not supposed to be installing new software, or if there's no user interaction, that's a problem. However, the logs don't provide that context.\n\nIn the absence of more information, the presence of multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and the creation of several files by setup.exe could be part of a legitimate installation. However, the repetition and the specific paths might warrant further investigation. But I think the answer here is that it's not necessarily malicious, but the combination of events is suspicious enough to require investigation. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **svchost.exe Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple entries show `svchost.exe` performing \"Registry value set\" operations. While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process hosting system services, **frequent or unexplained registry changes** could indicate tampering, persistence mechanisms, or malware activity. However, this alone is not conclusive.\n\n2. **setup.exe File Creation:**\n   - `setup.exe` is creating numerous files in the `Microsoft\\EdgeCore` directory, including executables like `msedge.exe`, `msedgewebview2.exe`, and a batch file for displaying licenses. These files align with **Microsoft Edge installation components** (e.g., version `137.0.3296.62`), which might be part of a **legitimate software update or installation**. However:\n     - **Unusual nesting** (e.g., `Installer\\setup.exe` within the EdgeCore directory) could indicate a staged or suspicious installation.\n     - **Lack of context** (e.g., user initiation, source of `setup.exe`) makes it difficult to confirm legitimacy.\n\n3. **Image Loading by setup.exe:**\n   - `setup.exe` loads `taskschd.dll` (Task Scheduler component), which is normal during setup processes. No immediate red flags here.\n\n4. **RuntimeBroker.exe Registry Modification:**\n   - A single entry shows `RuntimeBroker.exe` modifying the registry. This process is typically associated with app permissions in Windows 10\/11, so this is likely **benign**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Lack of Context:** Without knowing the source of `setup.exe` or whether the user initiated an Edge installation, the activity could be **legitimate** or **malicious**.\n- **Unusual Patterns:** The **high volume of registry changes** by `svchost.exe` and the **nested setup files** may suggest **unusual behavior** (e.g., a rogue installer or malware mimicking legitimate processes).\n- **No Clear Malware Indicators:** No obvious malware signatures (e.g., suspicious file paths, network activity, or process injection) are present, but the combination of events is **sufficiently anomalous** to warrant investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of:\n- **Unusual registry activity** by `svchost.exe`, and  \n- **Potentially staged installation behavior** by `setup.exe`.  \n\nFurther analysis (e.g., checking the origin of `setup.exe`, correlating with network activity, or examining system logs for other anomalies) is needed to determine if this is a **legitimate installation** or **malicious activity**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nMost of the events are related to registry changes. Processes like svchost.exe and services.exe are modifying the registry. That's normal to some extent because these are system processes, but the frequency might be a red flag. There are multiple entries of registry value sets and object additions\/deletions. However, I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThen, looking further down, there are events involving setup.exe. This process is creating files. The paths mentioned are in typical system directories like Program Files and Windows System32. But wait, one of the files created is msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe under Microsoft Edge's Application folder. Now, Microsoft Edge is a legitimate application, but the presence of these files might not be suspicious on its own. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating these files could be part of a legitimate installation, but I need to check if there's any other context.\n\nWait, but setup.exe is usually associated with installation processes. If this is part of a legitimate software installation, like Edge, then it's normal. But if setup.exe is not supposed to be running here, or if these files are being created in unexpected locations, that's a problem. However, the paths here seem to be standard for Edge. \n\nBut then there's also the creation of a shortcut file in the user's AppData and Start Menu. That's common during installation, so maybe that's okay. However, the key thing here is that all these events are related to setup.exe, which is a legitimate process, but the combination of registry changes and file creation might be part of a larger activity. \n\nWait, but the majority of the events are registry changes by svchost.exe and services.exe. Those are system processes, and they do interact with the registry. However, multiple registry modifications could be part of normal operations, like updates or service configurations. But if there's a pattern, like a lot of changes in a short time, that might be suspicious. However, the data here doesn't include timestamps, so I can't tell about timing. \n\nAnother thing is that there's no indication of malicious activity here. The processes involved are legitimate, and the files created are part of a known application. Unless there's something else, like unexpected command-line arguments or unexpected parent processes, but that's not mentioned here. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the events involve normal system processes making registry changes and setup.exe creating files as part of an installation. Without additional context like unusual parameters, unexpected locations, or other suspicious activities, this might just be part of a legitimate software installation or system update. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear indication of malicious behavior. However, I need to be cautious. If setup.exe is creating files in unusual places or if there are other indicators, but in this case, the paths are standard. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. If all the events are part of a legitimate process, then it's not interesting. However, if there's a pattern that's unusual, even if the individual events are normal, the combination might be. For example, if setup.exe is creating files and the same process is also modifying the registry in a way that's not typical for an installer. But without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn the absence of other indicators, I think the answer is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are consistent with normal system operations and software installation. The confidence might be around 0.4, as there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, but the presence of multiple events could be a minor red flag. However, since the processes and files are legitimate, it's not a strong indicator.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate system processes (svchost.exe, services.exe) performing standard registry operations and setup.exe creating files in expected locations related to Microsoft Edge installation.

So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The main thing is to look at all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries are from 'setup.exe' doing registry operations. There are a lot of 'Registry value set' events, which might be normal during installation, but maybe too many? Then there's a few 'Pipe Created' events, which could be part of normal process communication, but again, multiple instances might be suspicious.\n\nBut wait, there's also 'svchost.exe' creating files in the Windows Temp directory with names like APPX followed by random characters. That seems odd. Normally, svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, but creating multiple temporary files in Temp might be part of a legitimate process, like Windows Update or app installation. However, the fact that there are so many of them, and the filenames are typical of temporary files, could indicate something like a malicious payload being downloaded and extracted. Also, the presence of 'AppReadiness' in one of the file paths might be related to system readiness checks, but again, the volume here is high.\n\nAnother thing is that 'setup.exe' is involved in multiple registry changes. If this is part of a legitimate installation, it's possible, but if it's a malicious setup, modifying the registry could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, the logs don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unusual processes or network activity. But the combination of registry changes and file creation in Temp might be a red flag.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern. The fact that 'svchost.exe' is creating so many temporary files could be a sign of something. But svchost is known to host various system services, so maybe it's just part of normal operations. However, the repeated 'Registry value set' by setup.exe might be part of a setup process, but if it's happening multiple times, maybe it's a loop or an attempt to modify registry entries for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple registry modifications by setup.exe and the numerous temporary files created by svchost.exe in the Temp directory could be indicative of an installation or update process, but the high volume and the nature of the files might be suspicious. However, without more context, like network activity or other processes, it's hard to be certain.

First, I'll go through each event to spot any anomalies.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by svchost.exe. The first entry is a file created in the WindowsApps directory for EdgeGameAssist.exe. That's a legitimate Microsoft product, so maybe that's normal. But then there are multiple entries creating files in the AppReadiness folder with paths that look like security identifiers (SIDs). Those SIDs are part of the Windows security model, but creating files with such names in AppReadiness might be suspicious. AppReadiness is involved in application compatibility, so maybe that's why, but repeated creation of these files could indicate something's wrong.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. While svchost is a normal process, excessive registry changes could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is usually associated with UAC prompts, so that might be normal if there's user interaction. But again, multiple events might be concerning.\n\nThe PowerShell events are interesting. One is a simple Write-Host command, which is benign. But the subsequent ImageLoad events show PowerShell loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. While these are standard for PowerShell, the number of ImageLoad events might be high. However, the command line for the PowerShell process is a simple test command, which doesn't seem malicious. \n\nPutting it all together: the repeated file creation in AppReadiness with SID-like names and multiple registry changes by svchost could be suspicious. However, the PowerShell activities don't show obvious malicious intent. The EdgeGameAssist.exe is legitimate. But the combination of these events might indicate a legitimate process being used for something unusual.

The confidence is moderate, so I'd classify this as interesting but not highly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple svchost.exe processes creating files in Windows AppReadiness directory with SID-like filenames (potentially malicious), combined with repeated registry modifications and PowerShell loading .NET framework DLLs.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several Image Loaded events, which might be normal since PowerShell often loads various DLLs. But wait, some of the files mentioned are from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's a bit odd because those are legitimate files, but maybe they're being loaded in an unusual context?\n\nThen there's a File Created event with a path in the Windows Temp directory, named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_... That looks like a temporary file created by PowerShell. But why multiple times? Maybe the user is testing script policies, which could be normal, but sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious files.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event for whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool, but it's often used in attacks to check user context. However, just running whoami isn't necessarily malicious. \n\nAnother Process Create event has a long command line that checks INF files for specific patterns. This might be part of a script that's looking for installation sections in INF files. Not sure if that's benign or not. It could be part of a legitimate process, but maybe it's trying to find vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.\n\nThe repeated loading of .NET Framework DLLs like clr.dll and mscoreei.dll is normal for PowerShell, so that's probably just regular operations. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events for Defender's DLLs might indicate something. Maybe the process is interacting with Defender in a way that's unexpected?\n\nAlso, there are multiple File Create events in the Temp directory. If those files are scripts or other executable content, that could be a red flag. But the names here are .psm1 files, which are PowerShell modules. If they're being created in Temp, maybe they're part of a script that's being executed on the fly. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show normal PowerShell activity, including loading legitimate DLLs and creating temporary files. However, the repetition of certain events, especially the multiple Image Loads of Defender DLLs and the creation of Temp files with script-related extensions, might be worth investigating. It's possible that this is just normal behavior, but there's enough suspicious activity that it's not entirely benign. The confidence isn't super high, but there's enough to warrant further look into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involving file creation in temporary directories and loading of Windows Defender DLLs, which may indicate suspicious activity or potential evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a PowerShell process loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25050.5-0\\MpClient.dll. Wait, Windows Defender's files are usually in that location, but the version number here is specific. Maybe that's a legitimate file, but sometimes attackers might replace legitimate files with malicious ones. However, just loading a DLL from there isn't necessarily bad unless there's other context.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe command that uses DISM to disable the Windows Defender feature. The command line is \"Dism \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet\". Disabling Windows Defender is a red flag because it's a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection. This command is being run with \/quiet, so it's silent, which is suspicious. But is this a legitimate action? Maybe if the user is doing some system configuration, but it's unusual to disable Defender without a clear reason.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where Dism.exe is creating and detecting executable files in the user's Temp directory. The files are named things like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, etc. These are all DLLs that might be part of the DISM process, but the fact that they're being created in the Temp directory and detected as executables could indicate something's wrong. Legitimate processes might use Temp directories, but creating multiple executable files there might be part of a malicious payload being unpacked or executed.\n\nAnother point is that the same Dism.exe process is creating DismHost.exe in the Temp directory. That's a bit odd because DismHost.exe is a legitimate component, but if it's being created in the Temp folder by Dism.exe, maybe that's part of a normal operation. However, the fact that so many files are being created and detected in the Temp directory, especially with the same parent process, might suggest that this is not a normal operation. Also, the command line in the first event uses DISM to remove Windows Defender, which would make sense if the attacker is trying to disable the defender before doing something malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of disabling Windows Defender using DISM, followed by the creation of multiple executable files in the Temp directory by Dism.exe, which is typically not involved in creating such files, could be part of a larger malicious activity. The initial loading of the DLL from the Defender directory might be a red herring, but the subsequent actions are more suspicious. The presence of multiple executable files in the Temp directory, especially when the system's security features are being disabled, is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. So, this seems like a case where the system is being compromised, and the attacker is trying to disable defenses and execute payloads.\n<\/think>\n\nThe sequence of events indicates a potential **malicious activity** aimed at **disabling Windows Defender** and **executing suspicious files** in the Temp directory. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **Disabling Windows Defender via DISM**:\n   - The `cmd.exe` process executed the command:  \n     `Dism \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet`.  \n     - **Why it's suspicious**: Disabling Windows Defender is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection. The `\/quiet` flag hides the operation, making it stealthier.\n\n2. **Creation of Executable Files in Temp Directory**:\n   - **Dism.exe** (typically a legitimate tool for Windows image management) is creating and detecting **multiple executable files** (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `DismHost.exe`) in the Temp directory (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`).  \n     - **Why it's suspicious**:  \n       - Dism.exe is not typically involved in generating executable files in the Temp directory.  \n       - The presence of **numerous `.dll` and `.mui` files** (language-specific resource files) in Temp suggests **unusual behavior**, possibly linked to **payload unpacking** or **malicious code execution**.\n\n3. **Potential for Persistence or Malware Execution**:\n   - The creation of `DismHost.exe` in Temp (a legitimate file but often associated with system processes) could be a **red flag** if it is being used to execute malicious code or bypass security measures.\n\n---\n\n### Possible Attack Scenario:\n- An attacker may have **compromised the system** (e.g., via phishing, exploit, or lateral movement) and is attempting to:\n  1. **Disable Windows Defender** to avoid detection.\n  2. **Deploy malicious payloads** in the Temp directory using Dism.exe (possibly exploiting a misconfiguration or privilege escalation).\n  3. **Execute or persist** the malicious code via the created files.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate the Source of the DISM Command**:\n   - Check logs (e.g., **Event Viewer**, **Windows Defender logs**) to determine how the DISM command was triggered and by which user\/privilege level.\n\n2. **Analyze the Temp Directory Files**:\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal**, **YARA rules**, or **static analysis** to scan the created files (`AppxProvider.dll`, `DismHost.exe`, etc.) for malware signatures.\n\n3. **Re-enable Windows Defender**:\n   - If the DISM command was unauthorized, re-enable the Windows Defender feature via:  \n     ```powershell\n     Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Defender -All\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for System Compromise**:\n   - Run a full system scan with **Windows Defender Antivirus**, **Microsoft Defender ATP**, or third-party tools.\n   - Monitor for unusual network activity, unauthorized processes, or changes to system files.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of **disabling Windows Defender** and **unusual file creation** in the Temp directory by **Dism.exe** strongly suggests **malicious activity**. Immediate investigation and mitigation are required to prevent further compromise."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process detecting various DLL files in the Temp directory. The filenames all end with .mui, which I know are typically Microsoft UI language files. But wait, the rule triggering here is \"FileExecutableDetected,\" which usually flags executable files. MUI files are usually resources, not executables. That's a bit odd.\n\nNow, looking at the paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp folder under a specific GUID. That GUID might be part of a temporary installation or update process. However, the fact that Dism.exe is detecting so many of these files as executables could be a false positive if the detection rule isn't properly configured to distinguish between MUI files and actual executables. But then again, if these files are being executed, that's suspicious. However, MUI files are not typically executed directly. \n\nAnother point is the number of events. There are 15 entries, all from the same process and same directory. That's a lot of files being flagged. It might indicate a legitimate software update or deployment, but it's also possible that an attacker is using Dism.exe to drop malicious files. However, the names of the files (like DismCore.dll.mui) seem to be related to DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management), which is a legitimate Windows tool. The presence of multiple .mui files could be part of a legitimate language pack or resource update. \n\nBut wait, the detection rule is \"FileExecutableDetected,\" which might be a custom rule. If the rule is too broad, it could be flagging non-executable files. However, the fact that all these files are in the Temp directory and associated with Dism.exe might be part of a legitimate process, like applying an update. However, the high number of files and the specific naming might be a red flag. Alternatively, it could be a benign activity if the system is undergoing a language pack installation or similar. \n\nI need to check if .mui files are ever considered executable. From what I remember, MUI files are satellite assemblies for resources, not executables. So, the detection rule might be misconfigured. However, the fact that Dism.exe is involved could be part of a legitimate process. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The logs don't show any other processes or activities, so it's possible that this is a false positive. However, the high number of events and the specific pattern might still warrant further investigation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the logs might be a false positive due to the detection rule's configuration, the sheer number of files and their location in the Temp directory could indicate either a legitimate but unusual activity or a potential security issue. The answer would depend on whether the system is known to be performing such updates, but based solely on the logs, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that all files are related to DISM and are in the Temp folder, it's more likely a legitimate process, but the detection rule might need adjustment.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) tool** is flagging multiple `.mui` (Microsoft UI Language) files in the **AppData\\Local\\Temp** directory as \"executable\" via the **FileExecutableDetected** rule. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimacy of `.mui` Files**:\n   - `.mui` files are **resource files** for localized UI strings, **not executable** files. They are typically used by Windows for language-specific resources and are not directly executed.\n   - The detection rule (**FileExecutableDetected**) may be **overly broad**, misclassifying non-executable files (e.g., `.mui`, `.dll`, `.manifest`) as threats.\n\n2. **Context of DISM**:\n   - **DISM** is a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging, deployment, and managing Windows components. It often interacts with `.mui` files during updates, language packs, or system repairs.\n   - The **GUID-based directory** (`33BFE96B-A816-42D9-97E6-7D4C5E730E84`) suggests a temporary operation, possibly related to a **Windows Update** or **language pack installation**.\n\n3. **High Volume of Events**:\n   - **15 events** from the same process (`Dism.exe`) and directory indicate a **systematic operation** (e.g., applying updates, extracting resources). This is **common during Windows updates** or deployments.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n- **False Positive**:\n  - The detection rule (**FileExecutableDetected**) may not distinguish between `.mui` files and actual executables. This is a **known issue** with some SIEM or endpoint detection tools misclassifying file types.\n  - **No malicious activity** is evident in the logs (e.g., no unusual process behavior, network connections, or file modifications).\n\n- **Legitimate System Activity**:\n  - The logs align with **Windows Update** or **language pack installation** workflows. DISM often handles `.mui` files during such operations.\n\n- **Potential Security Concern**:\n  - If the system is **not undergoing updates** and the `.mui` files are **unrelated to known updates**, this could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., an attacker using DISM to drop malicious payloads). However, **no evidence of this is present** in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Review Detection Rule**:\n   - Adjust the **FileExecutableDetected** rule to exclude `.mui` files and other non-executable types (e.g., `.dll`, `.manifest`) unless they are in unexpected locations.\n\n2. **Correlate with System Context**:\n   - Check if the system was **recently updated** or **redeployed**. If so, this is likely **benign**.\n   - Look for **additional logs** (e.g., Windows Event Viewer, network activity) to confirm whether this is part of a legitimate update.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - If no updates are in progress, investigate further (e.g., check file hashes, inspect processes, or use tools like **Process Monitor** to trace DISM activity).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not indicate a security threat** and are **likely a false positive** due to a misconfigured detection rule. The activity aligns with **legitimate DISM operations** during system updates or language pack installations. However, the detection rule should be reviewed to avoid unnecessary alerts. \n\n**Classification**: **False Positive (Likely)**  \n**Action**: Refine detection rules and confirm system context."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at all the events together.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: all of them are 'Dism.exe'. Dism is a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging and deployment, so that's normal. But the files being detected as executable by the rule 'FileExecutableDetected' are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. The filenames are things like SmiProvider.dll.mui, SysprepProvider.dll.mui, etc. These look like DLL files, which are common in Windows for various functions. \n\nWait, but why are they being flagged? The rule is 'FileExecutableDetected', which might be part of a security system's alerting. However, many legitimate processes, including Dism, do create and use temporary DLLs during operations. The fact that all these files are in the Temp folder and have .dll.mui extensions (which are typically language-specific resources) might be normal. However, the sheer number of these files being detected by the same rule could be a red flag. \n\nBut I need to check if there's any suspicious pattern. The path is the same for all: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ followed by a GUID and then the filenames. The GUID suggests a temporary or unique session, which is common in setup processes. However, if this is part of a legitimate system update or deployment, it's okay. But if this is happening without user interaction or in an unexpected context, it might be malicious. \n\nHowever, since all the events are related to Dism.exe, which is a legitimate tool, and the files are in the Temp directory (a common place for temporary files), this might just be part of a normal system process. The security rule might be too broad, flagging legitimate files. \n\nBut the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. If there's no other context, like unusual behavior or other alerts, it might not be a security issue. However, the fact that so many files are being detected as executable by the same rule could indicate a potential problem, such as a false positive in the security system or maybe a malicious process masquerading as legitimate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is performing a large deployment or update, which would involve many temporary files. Without more context, it's hard to say. But given that all the files are in the Temp directory and associated with Dism, which is a legitimate tool, it's possible that this is just a normal operation. However, the high number of alerts might still warrant further investigation to ensure that the security system isn't misconfigured or that there's no underlying issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided events involve multiple detections of `.dll` and `.dll.mui` files in a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\{GUID}`) by the **`FileExecutableDetected`** rule, all triggered by **`Dism.exe`** (a legitimate Windows imaging tool). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Context:**\n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a core Windows utility for deployment and imaging, often used during system updates, repairs, or deployments. It frequently generates temporary files in the `%TEMP%` directory.\n   - The filenames (e.g., `SmiProvider.dll.mui`, `ImagingProvider.dll`) resemble **resource DLLs** (`.mui` files are language-specific satellite DLLs), which are common in Windows for localization and system operations.\n\n2. **Potential False Positives:**\n   - The **`FileExecutableDetected`** rule may be overly broad, flagging legitimate system files. This is not unusual in endpoint detection systems, where benign processes can trigger alerts if the rule lacks contextual filters (e.g., allowing temporary files created by trusted tools like `Dism.exe`).\n\n3. **No Immediate Malicious Indicators:**\n   - All files are in a **temporary directory** under a unique GUID path, which is typical for transient operations (e.g., system updates, disk imaging).\n   - No anomalies (e.g., unexpected process behavior, network activity, or persistence mechanisms) are mentioned in the logs.\n\n### **Why This Might Be Interesting for Investigation:**\n- **High Volume of Alerts:** If this is part of a **normal system operation**, the sheer number of alerts could indicate a **misconfigured security rule** or a **false positive** that needs tuning.\n- **Contextual Gaps:** Without additional logs (e.g., process tree, network activity, user context), it’s hard to rule out **malicious use of `Dism.exe`** (e.g., in a supply chain attack or ransomware scenario where the tool is abused for malicious purposes).\n- **Temporary Files in %TEMP%:** While normal, the presence of many `.dll` files in `%TEMP%` could also hint at **unusual system activity**, especially if the files are not tied to a known legitimate process or update.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check if `Dism.exe` is running in an **unexpected context** (e.g., during off-hours, without user interaction, or in a non-admin session).\n- **Review Security Rule Logic:** Ensure the **`FileExecutableDetected`** rule includes exclusions for **trusted temporary files** created by legitimate tools like `Dism.exe`.\n- **Monitor for Anomalies:** If this is part of a **deployment or update**, ensure it aligns with **planned system activities**. If not, investigate further for potential compromise.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events are **likely benign** (normal `Dism.exe` operation), the **high volume of alerts** and lack of contextual details warrant **further investigation** to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or a **potential security issue**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system log event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are related to processes named Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The winlog entries mention \"File Executable Detected\" and \"Process Create\" and \"Image loaded\" tasks. The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder. \n\nNow, Dism.exe is part of the Windows Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, which is used for deploying and managing Windows images. It's a legitimate tool, but it's also sometimes abused by malware because it can modify system files. The fact that multiple DLLs are being detected here might be normal if they're part of a legitimate deployment, but it's also a red flag if they're unexpected.\n\nLooking at the files, they're all in the Temp directory. That's a common place for temporary files, but if a lot of executable files are being created there, especially with names like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc., that might be suspicious. However, some of these DLLs could be part of the normal operation of Dism, especially during imaging processes.\n\nThen there's the DismHost.exe process. The command line includes a GUID, which might be part of a legitimate operation, but again, it's something to check. The image load events are loading various DLLs from the same Temp directory. Legitimate processes can load DLLs from temporary directories, but if these DLLs are not signed or are from unexpected sources, that's a problem.\n\nHowever, in this case, all the files are being created by Dism.exe and DismHost.exe, which are legitimate processes. The presence of multiple DLLs being loaded might be part of a normal deployment or imaging task. But since all these events are happening in a short time and involve a lot of files, it could also indicate that someone is using Dism to inject malicious code. \n\nBut wait, the user hasn't provided any information about the system context. If this is part of a legitimate deployment, then it's normal. However, if the system isn't undergoing any deployment or imaging, this could be suspicious. Since the logs don't include user context or other indicators like network activity, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn the absence of other indicators, the presence of these events might be normal. However, the sheer number of files and the use of the Temp directory could still be a red flag. But since all the processes involved are legitimate, and the files are being created by them, it's possible that this is a legitimate activity. \n\nSo, I think the answer here is that while the events are unusual, they might be part of a legitimate process. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain.

However, the pattern of activity raises **potential concerns** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**:\n1. **Legitimate Tools**:\n   - **Dism.exe** and **DismHost.exe** are part of the Windows Deployment Imaging Service, used for tasks like imaging, mounting, and configuring Windows. They are **not inherently malicious**.\n   - The loading of DLLs (e.g., `DismProv.dll`, `OSProvider.dll`) is typical during deployment operations.\n\n2. **Unusual Behavior**:\n   - **Multiple executable\/DLL files** are created in the **Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`) under a GUID-named folder. While temporary files are normal, the **volume and specific naming** (e.g., `ProvProvider.dll`, `MsiProvider.dll`) could be **suspicious** if unrelated to active deployment tasks.\n   - The **GUID in the command line** (`DismHost.exe` with `...{GUID}...`) might indicate a **custom or automated deployment process**, but this alone is not conclusive.\n\n3. **No Clear Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No **network activity**, **unusual process trees**, or **uncommon command-line arguments** are present in the logs.\n   - The files are all loaded by **legitimate processes** (Dism\/DismHost), and there is no mention of **unsigned or obfuscated binaries**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Might Be Interesting**:\n- **Context Matters**: If the system is **not undergoing a deployment or imaging task**, the activity could be **abnormal**. For example, Dism is rarely used in routine user scenarios.\n- **Persistence or Evasion**: The use of the **Temp directory** and GUID-based filenames could be an attempt to **hide malicious activity** (e.g., droppers or loaders), though this is speculative without additional evidence.\n- **Lack of Context**: The logs do not include timestamps, user context, or correlation with other events (e.g., network connections, registry changes), making it difficult to assess intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**:\n- **Check System Context**: Confirm whether the system is undergoing a **legitimate deployment or imaging task**. If not, investigate further.\n- **Analyze Files**: Verify the **digital signatures** and **integrity** of the DLLs and executables (e.g., `DismCorePS.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`). Unusual files could be malicious.\n- **Monitor for Anomalies**: Look for **unusual process behavior**, **unexpected network traffic**, or **unauthorized changes to system files**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe activity **could be legitimate** if tied to a deployment task. However, the **concentration of files in the Temp directory** and the **absence of contextual clues** make it **worth further investigation** to rule out potential misuse of Dism tools. **Not definitively malicious**, but **suspicious enough to warrant closer scrutiny**. \n\n**Classification**: **Suspicious (needs context)**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through each event. All the entries have the process name as DismHost.exe or Dism.exe, and they're related to image loading or file deletions. The first 13 events are all about DismHost.exe loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The files have names like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. Then there's a process termination event for DismHost.exe, followed by Dism.exe deleting some of those DLL files.\n\nHmm. Now, I know that DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool, which is used for Windows image management. It's a legitimate process, but sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded from the Temp folder might be a red flag. Typically, system processes don't load a lot of DLLs from temporary directories unless they're part of a legitimate operation, like applying updates or configurations.\n\nWait, but the deletion of files by Dism.exe after the process terminates could be part of a normal cleanup. However, the combination of loading many DLLs from the same temporary directory and then deleting them might indicate something unusual. Let me think: if this were a legitimate DISM operation, would it load all these different providers? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure. Some of these DLLs like AppxProvider.dll or SysprepProvider.dll might be part of specific DISM functions, but the sheer number of them being loaded from Temp might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that the same GUID is in the path (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89) could be a sign that this is a temporary directory created for a specific operation. But again, that's normal for temporary files. However, if the system is not expecting such a large number of DLLs being loaded and then deleted, that might be a sign of something malicious. Alternatively, it could be part of a script or automated process that's using DISM in an unusual way.\n\nAnother point: the event where DismHost.exe terminates, and then Dism.exe deletes the files. That sequence could be normal, but if the files are being deleted immediately after use, that might be a way to avoid leaving traces. However, that's a bit of a stretch. I need to check if there are any known malicious activities associated with these DLLs. From what I recall, these providers are part of DISM's functionality, so they might be legitimate.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. The key here is that while the processes themselves are legitimate, the pattern of loading many DLLs from a temporary directory and then deleting them might be unusual. It could be a sign of a legitimate process being used in an unusual way, or it could be a malicious process masquerading as DISM. Since the logs don't show any obvious signs of malware (like unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, etc.), but the behavior is still out of the ordinary for typical DISM operations, this might warrant further investigation.\n\nIn summary, the combination of multiple DLL loads from a temp directory followed by deletions by a related process is suspicious enough to be considered interesting for investigation, even if the processes themselves are legitimate. It's not a clear-cut malware case, but the anomaly in behavior is worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a sequence of events involving **DismHost.exe** and **Dism.exe**, which are legitimate Windows tools for managing Windows images. However, the pattern of activity raises **sufficient suspicion to warrant further investigation** due to the following anomalies:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual Volume of DLL Loads from Temp Directory:**\n   - **13 DLLs** (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`, `TransmogProvider.dll`) are loaded from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). \n   - While DISM tools can load providers, the **specific combination** of providers and the **quantity** of DLLs loaded from a temporary directory is atypical for standard operations.\n\n2. **Post-Execution Cleanup:**\n   - After **DismHost.exe terminates**, **Dism.exe deletes** several of the same DLLs (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `AssocProvider.dll`).\n   - This **immediate cleanup** could be part of a legitimate process, but the **lack of context** (e.g., no related system update, imaging, or configuration task) makes it suspicious.\n\n3. **Lack of Contextual Indicators:**\n   - No logs indicate a **legitimate DISM operation** (e.g., `dism \/apply-image`, `dism \/enable-feature`), which would typically be documented in system logs or user activity.\n   - No **command-line arguments** or **parent process information** is provided, which is critical for determining intent.\n\n---\n\n### 🚩 **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- **Behavioral Anomaly:** Legitimate DISM operations rarely load **dozens of DLLs** from a temporary directory in a short timeframe, especially without clear context.\n- **Potential for Abuse:** Malware could **mimic DISM** to evade detection (e.g., using a legitimate process to execute malicious code in memory).\n- **Cleanup Pattern:** Deleting files post-execution may be an attempt to **avoid forensic traces**, though this is not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### 🛡️ **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check System Logs for Context:**\n   - Look for **related events** (e.g., `Event ID 4688` for process creation, `Event ID 4663` for file access) to determine if this activity is tied to a known legitimate task.\n\n2. **Analyze the Temporary Directory:**\n   - Examine the contents of `%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89` for **unusual files** or **metadata** (e.g., timestamps, hashes).\n\n3. **Monitor for Recurrence:**\n   - If this pattern repeats or is observed on multiple systems, it could indicate a **broader threat** (e.g., a script-based attack or compromised tool).\n\n4. **YARA Rule or Signature Check:**\n   - Cross-reference the DLLs\/hashes with malware repositories (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to rule out known malicious artifacts.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Conclusion:**\nWhile the processes involved (**DismHost.exe**, **Dism.exe**) are legitimate, the **unusual behavior**—loading numerous DLLs from a temporary directory followed by immediate deletion—**merits further investigation**. This could indicate either:\n- A **legitimate but non-standard use case** (e.g., a custom script), or  \n- **Malicious activity** leveraging a trusted system process for stealth.\n\n**Recommendation:** Investigate further using the steps above to determine intent and context."}

So, there are multiple entries here, all from the Dism.exe process, each logging a file delete event. The files being deleted are all .mui files located in the Temp directory under a specific UUID path. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Dism.exe does. Dism is the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, used for managing Windows images. It's commonly used in tasks like applying updates, mounting images, etc. But why would it be deleting so many .mui files?\n\n.MUI files are language-specific resource files, usually part of the Windows operating system.

However, the fact that all these files are being deleted in quick succession might be suspicious. \n\nBut wait, the path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a common location for temporary files.

The fact that multiple provider DLLs are being deleted might be part of a larger operation, like preparing a system image or applying updates.\n\nBut wait, why so many files? Could this be a red flag? Well, if these deletions are part of a legitimate process, then it's normal. However, if Dism.exe is being used in an unexpected context, maybe by an attacker, that could be a problem. But the logs don't show any other suspicious activity, like unauthorized access or unexpected commands. The process name is correct, and the task is a standard FileDeleteDetected rule.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. On one hand, Dism.exe is legitimate, and deleting temp files is normal. On the other hand, the sheer number of files being deleted might be unusual. However, considering that these are all part of a single GUID folder, it's likely that they're all related to a single deployment or imaging task. Without additional context, like other events or processes, it's hard to say. But based solely on these logs, it seems like a legitimate activity. So maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Dism.exe file deletions in the Windows Temp directory during deployment\/imaging operations. The filenames (e.g., FfuProvider.dll, SysprepProvider.dll) align with standard Windows setup components. No anomalous patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON-like log entries, and they want me to analyze them. Hmm, first, I need to understand the structure of these logs. Each entry has \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. The \"process\" field sometimes has a \"name\" or \"command_line\" inside. The \"winlog\" seems to be about system events, like \"Process Create\" or \"Registry value set\". The \"file\" field is either a path or \"None\".\n\nThe user might be looking for something specific, maybe security-related? Because some of the events are about process creation, registry changes, and even a PowerShell command that creates a new service. That PowerShell command line stands out: it's using New-Service and Start-Service to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". That could be a red flag if the service is malicious or if the file path is unusual.\n\nI should check if the \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is in a standard directory. The path given is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_comum\" don't look like standard Windows directories. Typically, services are placed in system directories like System32. This might indicate a potential security threat, like a backdoor or malware.\n\nAlso, the repeated entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" in the winlog task might be part of an event log provider. But the multiple instances of the same command_line suggest that the PowerShell script is being executed multiple times, which could be a sign of persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the \"file\" field is \"None\" for most entries except when a DLL is loaded. The \"taskschd.dll\" is a legitimate Windows file, so that's probably normal. But the presence of the new service with an unusual path is suspicious.\n\nThe user might not have mentioned it, but they could be trying to detect malicious activities on their system. They might need help identifying if the created service is legitimate or if it's a security risk. They might also want to know how to investigate further, like checking the integrity of the \"tarefa_logico.exe\" file, looking for other related processes, or checking the system's event logs for more details.\n\nI should also consider that the user might be using a SIEM or log analysis tool and needs to filter or alert on such events. The PowerShell command is a common method for attackers to create persistent services. So, suggesting that they check the service details, verify the file's digital signature, and monitor for unusual network activity from the new service would be helpful.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the unusual service creation, the non-standard file path, and the repetition of the same command. These are indicators that could point to a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs contain several entries that may indicate suspicious activity, particularly related to **Windows service creation** and **PowerShell execution**. Below is an analysis of the key findings and potential security implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious PowerShell Command**\n**Command Line Example:**\n```powershell\npowershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" ; Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n```\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- **Service Creation:** A new service named `objeto_ativo` is created with a binary path pointing to `tarefa_logico.exe` in a non-standard directory (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`).\n- **Unusual Directory:** The path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin` is not a typical Windows system directory. This could indicate:\n  - **Malware persistence** (e.g., a backdoor or malicious service).\n  - **Custom or compromised application**.\n- **PowerShell Use:** The use of `New-Service` and `Start-Service` via PowerShell is common in **script-based attacks** for creating persistent access.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- **Verify the legitimacy** of the `tarefa_logico.exe` file:\n  - Check its **digital signature** (if any).\n  - Analyze its **hash** against threat intelligence databases (e.g., VirusTotal).\n  - Inspect the file's **behavior** in a sandboxed environment.\n- **Monitor for network activity** from the new service (e.g., unusual outbound connections).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**\nMultiple entries show:\n```json\n\"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Provider Lifecycle\"}\n```\n\n**Implications:**\n- These events may relate to **event log providers** or **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)** activity.\n- Repeated occurrences could indicate **tooling or scripts** interacting with system components (e.g., logging, monitoring, or exploitation).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., **Windows Security Logs**, **Application Logs**) to identify the source of the activity.\n- Check for **unauthorized access** or **WMI exploitation** (e.g., via `wmic` or PowerShell).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Service Creation in Non-Standard Path**\n**Binary Path:**\n```plaintext\nC:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\n```\n\n**Risk:**\n- **Unusual location:** This is not a standard system directory (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`).\n- **Potential for Malware:** Services in non-standard directories are often associated with **malware persistence** or **custom backdoors**.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- **Check the service details** via `sc query` or `Get-Service` in PowerShell.\n- **Investigate the file's origin** (e.g., was it installed recently? Is it signed by a trusted publisher?).\n\n---\n\n### **4. \"taskschd.dll\" in File Entry**\nOne entry includes:\n```json\n\"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll\"}\n```\n\n**Context:**\n- `taskschd.dll` is a **legitimate Windows component** related to **Task Scheduler**.\n- This entry appears to be **normal** and unrelated to the suspicious service creation.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Registry Changes and Process Creation**\nEntries with:\n```json\n\"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set\", \"Process Create\"}\n```\n\n**Implications:**\n- These events may indicate **post-exploitation activities** (e.g., modifying registry keys for persistence or disabling security features).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Correlate these events with **user activity logs** to identify the source.\n- Use tools like **Sysmon** or **Windows Event Log Analysis** to detect anomalous behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Risk**\n| **Event** | **Risk Level** | **Action Required** |\n|-----------|----------------|---------------------|\n| PowerShell service creation with non-standard path | **High** | Investigate `tarefa_logico.exe`, check for malware, monitor network traffic. |\n| Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events | **Medium** | Correlate with other logs, check for WMI exploitation. |\n| Service in non-standard directory | **High** | Verify legitimacy of the service and binary. |\n| Legitimate `taskschd.dll` reference | **Low** | No action required. |\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Isolate the system** if `tarefa_logico.exe` is confirmed malicious.\n2. **Run a full antivirus scan** and use **EDR tools** (e.g., CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender) to detect threats.\n3. **Review Windows Event Logs** for additional clues (e.g., **4688** for process creation, **4657** for registry changes).\n4. **Implement monitoring** for PowerShell usage and service creation via **SIEM** or **log analysis tools**.\n\nLet me know if you need help with specific tools or further investigation!"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one stands out because it's using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable in a non-standard directory: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. Then it starts that service. That's suspicious because creating a service with a custom executable, especially from a directory that doesn't look like a typical system path, could be a sign of malware trying to persist on the system.\n\nThe rest of the events are all about running PowerShell commands with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The commands are mostly simple, like writing a host message or checking INF files for certain patterns. The repeated commands might be part of a legitimate script or a test, but they don't seem malicious on their own. However, the first event's action of creating and starting a service is a red flag. Even though the other events are benign, the presence of that first event makes the entire batch worth investigating. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity beyond the service creation, but it's enough to warrant further look into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows PowerShell creating and starting a custom service ('objeto_ativo') with an executable located in a non-standard path (C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...), which is suspicious for potential persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a batch of events in JSONL format. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first two entries, they both have the same process command line. The command is using PowerShell to check for INF files in the Windows directory that contain specific patterns related to different architectures (like amd64, x86, etc.). The script is looking for sections named [defaultinstall.nt...], which might be part of a setup or installation process. The fact that it's scanning INF files could be suspicious because INF files are often used in driver installations or system configurations. However, I need to check if this is a legitimate activity or something malicious.\n\nThe next entries are about Security Group Management and Logon tasks. The third entry has a process named 'services.exe' under the Logon task. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, so that might not be suspicious. The fourth entry is about a Special Logon with no process information. \n\nNow, the key here is that the first two events are identical. PowerShell scripts that scan INF files might be part of a legitimate diagnostic tool, but they could also be part of a malware that's checking for system configurations to determine compatibility or to find vulnerabilities. The script's purpose isn't immediately clear. However, the repetition of the same command line in two separate events might indicate that this is a recurring activity, which could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators? The other events don't seem to have any obvious malicious activity. The 'services.exe' is normal. The Security Group Management and Special Logon tasks don't have any suspicious process details. \n\nHowever, the fact that the same PowerShell command is executed twice might be significant. Maybe it's part of a legitimate check, but if it's being run multiple times in a short period, that could be a sign of something else. But without more context, like the frequency or other related events, it's hard to say. \n\nThe justification for classification would be whether the events show signs of malicious behavior. The PowerShell script scanning INF files isn't inherently malicious, but the repetition and the specific pattern matching could be suspicious. However, since there's no other evidence like file creation, network activity, or unauthorized access, the confidence might be moderate. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the repeated execution of the same PowerShell command that's scanning system INF files could be a sign of reconnaissance or preparation for an attack. However, without more context, it's not definitive. The confidence would be around 0.65, as there's some suspicious activity but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The same PowerShell command scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections is repeated twice, which may indicate reconnaissance for exploitation or compatibility checks. While not definitively malicious, the repetitive nature and system-level file scanning warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
