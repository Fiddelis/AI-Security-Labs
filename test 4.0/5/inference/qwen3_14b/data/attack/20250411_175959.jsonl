{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the entries has a command_line with a PowerShell script that runs commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups, which could be part of reconnaissance. That's suspicious because legitimate scripts usually don't do all that unless they're part of a known process. But in this case, it's not clear if it's authorized.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading those DLLs might be normal, but combined with the command line, it could indicate that the PowerShell process is being used for something more than just regular tasks.\n\nAlso, there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a script might be an attempt to execute something temporarily without leaving traces. That's a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any indication of malicious intent. The PowerShell commands are all built-in and could be part of a legitimate script, but the combination with the file creation and deletion, along with multiple registry and process events, might be pointing towards something more. But without more context, like unexpected network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the classification is for the entire batch. Even though some activities are normal, the presence of multiple suspicious events (like the PowerShell script gathering system info, creating a temp file, and loading various DLLs) might be enough to flag it as interesting. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible that this is part of a legitimate process, but the combination of events is concerning. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7 or 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including system reconnaissance commands (net user, get-localgroup), temporary script file creation\/deletion, and loading of multiple DLLs which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look at the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of PowerShell commands being run. The command_line shows things like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, and listing directories in C:\\Users. These commands are typically used to gather information about users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag because such activities could be part of reconnaissance by an attacker trying to map out the system.\n\nThen there's a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be normal if it's part of log collection, but I need to check if that's part of the system's usual operations. However, the repeated PowerShell commands, especially the ones that list users and groups, are concerning. Also, the use of cmdkey.exe \/list could be trying to extract stored credentials, which is definitely suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the presence of multiple events related to the same PowerShell command being executed multiple times. That repetition might indicate that the attacker is trying to gather as much information as possible. Also, the creation of a file named pacote_ativo.txt by PowerShell could be an attempt to write out data, maybe exfiltrating information.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets. While Chrome might modify the registry during updates or normal operations, having so many entries might be part of normal behavior, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the majority of the suspicious activity is centered around PowerShell and the user\/group enumeration.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The winlogbeat file creation might be benign, but the presence of multiple PowerShell events with similar commands is more indicative of potential malicious activity. The use of get-childitem and dir on C:\\Users could be looking for user profiles, which is a common step in privilege escalation or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level: since there are multiple instances of the same suspicious commands, and the actions align with information gathering, it's likely a security incident. However, without more context like the system's normal behavior, there's a chance it could be a false positive. But given the repetitive nature and the commands used, I'd lean towards INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are executed to enumerate local users, groups, and credentials (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'cmdkey.exe \/list'), which are common in reconnaissance phases of attacks.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: updater.exe from Google, running with some command line arguments. It's a legitimate process, part of Google's updater. The command line includes a database path and a URL for crash reporting. Seems normal, but maybe the URL is suspicious? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, cmdkey.exe \/list. That's a standard command to list stored credentials. Not inherently malicious, but could be part of credential theft if done in the wrong context.\n\nThen, powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is common, but when combined with other events, it might be a red flag. The next event has a PowerShell command that runs several commands: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. This looks like someone is enumerating users, groups, and checking credentials. That's typical in a post-exploitation phase, which is suspicious.\n\nThen there's a bunch of events with \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" tasks. These could be part of normal administrative tasks, but if done by a non-admin user or without proper authorization, they might be malicious. However, the logs don't specify the user or context, so it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. SDXHelper is part of the Windows Search service, but loading certain DLLs might be normal. However, if these are being loaded from unexpected paths or in unusual contexts, it could be a sign of something else. But the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe not.\n\nThen there's net.exe and net1.exe running localgroup commands. Net1.exe isn't a standard Windows tool; that's odd. Maybe a typo or a malicious replacement. The command line uses net1.exe, which could be a red flag if it's not a legitimate file.\n\nPowerShell creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for scripts, but if the file is a malicious payload, it's a concern. The registry value being set by PowerShell and conhost.exe might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of legitimate processes and commands, but the PowerShell script is enumerating system information, which is common in attacks. The presence of net1.exe (which isn't standard) and the multiple security-related tasks might indicate an investigation is needed. However, without more context like user accounts or unexpected network activity, it's a bit unclear. The confidence is moderate, so maybe around 0.65. It's not definitively malicious, but enough suspicious activity to warrant further look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell enumeration of user\/group info, non-standard 'net1.exe' execution, credential listing via cmdkey, and potential persistence through registry changes.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user wants me to analyze these system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch together, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal. But the file is a .yml.new file, which might be a configuration file. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a common process name. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, but if an unusual process is loading it, that could be suspicious. Maybe a red flag here.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a file isn't necessarily bad. However, the name is generic, so maybe not significant.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is running with a command line related to installation. That seems legitimate, as Edge updates are normal. But the command line mentions \"scheduler\" as the install source. Maybe that's okay, but not sure.\n\nTwo svchost.exe entries with registry value changes. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but multiple registry changes might be normal or could be part of a larger attack. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll. Taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler. If the update process is loading that, maybe it's part of a scheduled task. Could be legitimate, but maybe not.\n\nBackgroundTaskHost.exe loading urlmon.dll again. BackgroundTaskHost is related to background tasks in Windows. Again, urlmon.dll is normal, but if multiple processes are loading it, maybe something's up.\n\nThen, another winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file. Repeating the same action might be normal, but maybe someone is trying to modify the configuration.\n\nPowerShell.exe accessing the registry. That's common, but if it's modifying keys, that could be suspicious. But without more context, hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: Are there any patterns? The repeated file creation by winlogbeat might be normal, but the SDXHelper and BackgroundTaskHost loading urlmon.dll could be unusual. Also, the PowerShell activity. However, without more context like unexpected processes or unusual command lines, it's hard to be certain. Maybe the presence of multiple registry changes and image loads could indicate something, but I'm not sure if it's malicious. The confidence is a bit low, but maybe it's worth looking into. So, I'd say \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show unusual process behavior, including non-standard processes (SDXHelper.exe) loading system DLLs (urlmon.dll), PowerShell creating files, and registry modifications. While some activities (e.g., MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) appear legitimate, the combination of these events raises suspicion of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
