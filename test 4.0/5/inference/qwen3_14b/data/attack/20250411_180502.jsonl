{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. But then there's powershell.exe involved. Let me check the powershell events.\n\nOne entry shows a process creation with a command line that starts a batch file. The path looks a bit odd with multiple backslashes and dots, maybe trying to obfuscate the path? Not sure yet. Then there are several image loaded events for PowerShell, including some .NET DLLs. That's normal, but then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe legitimate, but could be a red flag if it's being used in an unusual way.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. That's common, but the file name has a random string, which might be part of a script that's being run. Also, the command lines for the processes have a pattern: starting processes with batch files located in various directories. The paths have \"..\\\" which is a parent directory reference. Maybe they're trying to access files in parent directories, which could be a way to bypass security measures or access files they shouldn't.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all start with \"powershell.exe & {Start-Process...\" which is a common way to execute scripts. However, if these batch files are executing malicious code, that's a problem. The fact that there are multiple such events might indicate automated or repeated execution of scripts, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple image loads from .NET components could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it might be part of a payload execution. The Temp directory is often used by malware to store temporary files, so that's a red flag.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware here. The events could be part of a legitimate script execution, maybe by a user running some automated tasks. But the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, the use of parent directory references, and the creation\/deletion of temporary files does raise suspicion. \n\nI need to weigh the normal activities (like Chrome's network connections) against the suspicious PowerShell events. Since the majority of the logs are about PowerShell doing things that could be part of an attack, even if not definitively malicious, it's worth investigating. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence like known malicious files or clear indicators of compromise, but the pattern is concerning enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing obfuscated batch scripts with suspicious file paths, combined with temporary file creation\/deletion and .NET DLL loading, suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used with Start-Process commands, that might be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. The first few entries have command lines like 'powershell.exe & {Start-Process \"C:\\objeto_padrao\\tarefa_ativo..\\tarefa_ativo\\entrada_base_script.bat\"}'. Wait, the paths here have '..\\' which is a directory traversal. That's often used in attacks to access files outside the intended directory. For example, the first entry's path is 'C:\\\\objeto_padrao\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat'. The '..' here would move up a directory, then back down. That might be an attempt to access a file in a parent directory, which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nAnother entry has a similar pattern: 'C:\\\\estrutura_base\\\\objeto_principal\\\\..\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\modulo_principal_script.bat'. Again, the '..' here. This seems suspicious because legitimate scripts usually don't need to traverse directories like that. It might be trying to execute a script from a different location, possibly to bypass security measures.\n\nThen there's an entry where a file is loaded from 'C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\4.18.25030.2-0\\\\MpClient.dll'. That's a legitimate Windows Defender DLL, so maybe that's normal. But the fact that it's being loaded by PowerShell might not be an issue here.\n\nOther entries involve Chrome.exe and Calculator.exe with registry value sets. Those might be normal, but the sheer number of Chrome entries (multiple registry events) could be a bit odd. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The ApplicationFrameHost.exe and conhost.exe entries don't stand out immediately.\n\nLooking at the 'cmd.exe' entry, it's running a script from 'C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat'. That's a regular command line execution, but again, the presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd processes might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe key points here are the directory traversal in the paths of the scripts being executed by PowerShell. This is a common technique in attacks to access files outside the intended directory, which could be an attempt to execute malicious scripts or bypass restrictions. The repetition of such patterns in multiple events increases the suspicion. However, there's no direct evidence of malware or exploitation here, just the suspicious paths. \n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because the directory traversal in the command lines of PowerShell processes is a potential indicator of malicious activity. The confidence is around 0.75 because while the patterns are suspicious, they could be part of legitimate processes, but the repetition and the use of '..' in paths are red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute scripts with suspicious directory traversal patterns (e.g., '..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\...'), which may indicate attempts to access files outside intended directories. This behavior is commonly associated with malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with 'Registry value set' tasks. Processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, and others are modifying the registry. But registry changes alone aren't necessarily bad. However, when combined with other events, they might indicate something.\n\nThen, looking at the 'Image loaded' events. Chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these files might be normal, but sometimes malware can inject code into these DLLs. However, just loading them isn't a red flag on its own. But if these were loaded from unusual paths or by unexpected processes, that could be a problem. Here, the paths look legitimate, though.\n\nNext, there are file creation events. One is svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That seems normal. Then, powershell.exe creates files in the Downloads folder, which is common for user activities. The other file created by winlogbeat.exe is part of a configuration file, which might be normal if the user is setting up the tool.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. Chrome.exe is involved in a lot of registry changes. That's a lot of entries. If a legitimate process is making many registry changes, it might be normal, but if it's unexpected, it could be malicious. However, Chrome does interact with the registry for various reasons like settings and extensions. But the sheer number of events might be worth noting.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any anomalies? For example, if chrome.exe was loading unexpected DLLs or if the registry changes were to specific keys that are typically modified by malware. But the data provided doesn't specify the registry keys or the exact changes made. So that's a limitation here.\n\nAlso, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file suggests that the user might be configuring a log shipper, which is normal for monitoring. However, if that's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, it could be relevant.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show normal activities like registry changes by common processes, loading of legitimate DLLs, and file creation in typical locations. However, the high frequency of chrome.exe modifying the registry might be unusual. But without more context on the specific registry keys or other suspicious behavior, it's hard to say definitively. The confidence here would be moderate. The justification would be that while some events are normal, the volume of registry changes by chrome.exe might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances performing frequent registry modifications (RegistryEvent) combined with loading of Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) may indicate either legitimate activity or potential tampering. The high frequency of registry changes by chrome.exe warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
