{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Some of these are normal system processes, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe can be used for malicious activities. \n\nThe winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created. The ImageLoad events mention urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system files, but loading them from unexpected places could be a red flag. However, in the logs, the paths are C:\\Windows\\System32, which is standard. So that might not be an issue here.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal, like a configuration file being created. But I should check if there's any unusual activity around that.\n\nLooking at the command lines: one of the cmd.exe entries has a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That seems suspicious. Deleting processes, especially if it's a legitimate process like notepad.exe, could be part of an attack to remove evidence or interfere with system functions. Also, the use of WMIC.exe to delete processes might be a sign of something malicious, as WMIC is often used in scripts for management tasks but can be abused.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed or having registry values set. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, without more context, like the specific commands run, it's hard to tell. But combined with the WMIC command, it might indicate someone trying to manipulate processes.\n\nThe presence of 'whoami.exe' is normal, but again, if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activities, it could be relevant. \n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious part is the cmd.exe command using wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's an unusual action that could be part of a larger attack. Also, the multiple registry changes and process accesses might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or monitor processes. However, some of these events could be legitimate, like normal system operations. \n\nBut since the classification needs to be based on the entire batch, the presence of that specific command to delete processes stands out. It's a red flag that might warrant further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. The justification would be the suspicious command in cmd.exe and the multiple registry and process events that could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: 1) 'cmd.exe' executing a WMIC command to delete 'notepad.exe' processes (potentially hiding malicious activity). 2) Repeated 'Registry value set' events for legitimate processes (possible elevation or persistence attempts). 3) 'Image loaded' events for system DLLs (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll) which could indicate tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event stands out: WMIC.exe loaded a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. But why is WMIC.exe loading it? WMIC is often used by attackers for command execution, so this might be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of Registry value set events by various processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. A lot of registry changes could indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. However, some of these might be normal, like chrome.exe making legitimate registry entries. But the sheer number might be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like an attempt to replace the Sticky Keys executable with a backup, which is a common tactic in attacks to replace system files with malicious ones. Sticky Keys is often targeted in attacks to enable privilege escalation.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command is \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". Deleting a scheduled task named \"win32times\" might be part of cleaning up after an attack or removing a scheduled task that was used for persistence. The presence of schtasks.exe in another log line confirms the deletion.\n\nMultiple process accesses by powershell.exe could be indicative of PowerShell being used for further attacks, like downloading payloads or executing commands. However, PowerShell is a common admin tool, so it's not always malicious.\n\nThe whoami.exe executions are probably just checking user context, which is normal. But combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: The WMIC loading a Defender DLL is unusual. The registry changes are numerous and could be part of configuration changes. The attempt to replace sethc.exe is a clear sign of a potential attack. The deletion of a scheduled task might be part of covering tracks. The confidence here is medium because while some events are suspicious, others are normal. But the combination of those specific actions (replacing system files, using WMIC, registry changes) makes it interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activity: WMIC.exe loading a Windows Defender DLL (potentially legitimate but context-dependent), multiple registry modifications by non-system processes, and a command to replace 'sethc.exe' (a known attack vector for privilege escalation).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, and chrome.exe. The winlog events mention things like Image loaded, Registry object added\/deleted, Registry value set, and Process accessed or created.\n\nThe first event is schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll from System32. That seems normal because schtasks.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. But I should check if there are any other suspicious files. Then there are several Registry events, which are common but could be part of normal operations or something malicious.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries have Image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these is normal, but maybe if they were from unexpected locations, that would be a red flag. However, the paths here are standard System32 and ProgramData locations, so that's probably okay.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being created or accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a legitimate tool. The fact that there are multiple ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess events might indicate some automated tasks or scripts running. However, without seeing the actual commands or more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThe whoami.exe executions are normal; they just display user information. The command_line for cmd.exe shows \"\/c\" which is used to run a command and then exit, but the actual command isn't shown here. That could be a red flag if the command was something malicious, but since it's cut off, maybe it's just a normal operation.\n\nLooking at the frequency: there are a lot of Registry value set events and ProcessAccess events. High frequency of such events could be indicative of something like a script or malware modifying the registry or accessing processes. However, it's also possible that this is just normal system activity, especially if the system is running a lot of background processes or updates.\n\nThe key points here are whether there are any unusual files being loaded, unexpected processes, or abnormal behavior. The only potentially suspicious thing I see is the multiple ImageLoad events for chrome.exe with Defender DLLs, but since the paths are legitimate, that's probably not an issue. The rest seems to be normal system processes and registry changes.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple registry changes and process accesses might be worth looking into, especially if there's a pattern or if these events are occurring in a short timeframe. But based solely on the information provided, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. So I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's nothing overtly suspicious here, even though the high number of events might be a bit concerning.

Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. The command line for some is 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like a no-op, maybe a test or a way to trigger events without actual commands. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image Loaded, File Created, and File Delete events. The Image Load events mention loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate parts of the .NET framework, so maybe part of normal PowerShell operations. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events could be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require those libraries.\n\nThen there's a File Created and then immediately File Delete event for a temporary script file. That might be part of a script execution that's cleaning up after itself. But the file path is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. However, if this is part of a malicious script, it might be trying to execute and then delete the evidence. But without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with the same command line might be related to PowerShell's internal processes or maybe some logging or monitoring tools. The 'winlogbeat.exe' event is about creating a configuration file, which seems legitimate if someone is setting up a log shipper. But if this is unexpected, it could be a red flag.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes, loading .NET DLLs, creating and deleting a temp file, and some lifecycle events. But none of the events show obvious malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or executing suspicious commands. The 'whoami.exe' is benign. The repeated 'powershell.exe & {}' might be a test or a way to generate logs without doing anything harmful. \n\nHowever, the combination of multiple process creations, registry changes, and file operations could be part of a larger attack, but without more context or indicators of compromise (like unusual network activity, unexpected binaries, or privilege escalation), it's hard to confirm. The events seem to be part of normal system operations or testing. Therefore, the classification might be 'NOT INTERESTING' because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loaded an image called MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But then there are several entries where powershell.exe is creating files in the user's AppData folder. The paths look a bit suspicious, especially since they're in the PowerShell StartupProfileData. Maybe that's where user profiles are stored, but creating files there could be part of normal operations or maybe something malicious.\n\nThen there are registry value set events for powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag if done by unexpected processes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The ProcessAccess events might indicate that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, which isn't necessarily bad but could be part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some of the PowerShell processes, they're using Test-Path to check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths have a pattern with multiple directories and parent references (like ..\\). This might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path or to access files in different directories. The fact that they're checking for these scripts and exiting with 0 or 1 could be part of a larger script that's conditionally executing commands based on the presence of these files. That seems suspicious because it's trying to determine if certain files exist, which might be part of a payload delivery or execution phase.\n\nThere are multiple instances of the same pattern in different directories, which could indicate a systematic check for specific scripts. The use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" in some events might relate to PowerShell's provider model, which is used for interacting with file systems, registry, etc. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if that's benign or malicious.\n\nThe presence of multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .dll files, including mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to .NET Framework, is normal. However, if these were from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. But in this case, the paths are standard system directories, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nPutting this all together: the main suspicious points are the repeated Test-Path commands checking for .bat files in various directories with parent references, which might be an attempt to locate or trigger execution of scripts. The creation of files in AppData and the registry modifications also raise flags.

There are several entries where PowerShell is loading images, like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are all legitimate .NET and Windows Defender files. But wait, there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. That seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a file might be part of a script that's trying to execute something without leaving traces. \n\nThen there's another file created in the Downloads folder, elemento_padrao.txt. That's a regular file, maybe just a test file. But the fact that PowerShell is creating files in Temp and Downloads could be normal, but combined with other events, it might not be. \n\nLooking at the command lines for some processes, there are PowerShell scripts checking if certain paths exist. The paths mentioned are like C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat. The use of ..\\ might be a red flag, but sometimes that's just part of the path. However, if these paths are part of a malicious script, that could be a sign. \n\nThere are also several registry events from Chrome.exe. A lot of registry value sets. That might be normal if Chrome is updating its settings, but if it's a lot of events, maybe something's wrong. However, the user mentioned that the batch includes Chrome events, but the main focus seems to be on PowerShell. \n\nThe Pipe Created event from PowerShell might be normal, but pipes can sometimes be used for inter-process communication in attacks. However, alone, that's not conclusive. \n\nThe key points here are the file creation and deletion in Temp, the PowerShell scripts checking paths, and the multiple image loads. But the files loaded are mostly legitimate. The creation of a temporary script file and then deleting it might be part of a malicious activity, like executing a script and cleaning up. However, without more evidence like the script content or unusual network activity, it's hard to say. \n\nBut considering that there are multiple events involving PowerShell creating and deleting files, even if they are temporary, and the presence of multiple registry changes, this might be worth investigating further.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a powershell.exe process creating a new item and setting content to a batch file. The command line shows New-Item and Set-Content commands, which are typical for creating files and writing content. The paths mentioned here are a bit suspicious because they have multiple directory levels, like \"modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\". The use of \"..\" might be an attempt to navigate up directories, which could be a red flag. Also, the content written is \"dir\", which is a simple command, but the fact that it's being written to multiple files across different paths might indicate some automation or setup.\n\nThen there are several other events with \"Process accessed\", \"Registry value set\", and \"Image loaded\" tasks. The image loaded events mention .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them isn't inherently malicious. However, when combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger process. The Windows Defender MpOAV.dll is also loaded, which is part of the antivirus, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nThe subsequent events all have similar command lines, each time creating a new item and setting content to a batch file with \"dir\" as the value. The paths vary, but the pattern is consistent: using New-Item to create a batch file in a certain path, then Set-Content to write \"dir\" into another batch file. The use of \"dir\" is a basic command, but the repetition across multiple files and different paths might be part of a script that's trying to create multiple entry points or spread out its activities.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The key points here are the repeated use of PowerShell to create and modify batch files, the use of directory traversal (..), and the fact that these are multiple events. While creating files isn't always bad, the pattern here could indicate an attempt to persist or execute commands. The involvement of multiple files and paths might be an evasion technique to avoid detection. However, without more context like network activity or other suspicious behavior, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut wait, the first event's command line has \"dir\" as the value, which is a simple directory listing command. If this is part of a larger malicious payload, it might be a way to execute commands later. However, just writing \"dir\" into a batch file isn't necessarily malicious. However, the fact that it's done multiple times in different locations might be an indicator of something more. Also, the use of PowerShell for these operations could be a sign, as PowerShell is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities.\n\nThe confidence level here is a bit tricky. On one hand, the activities are not overtly malicious, but the pattern and repetition might be suspicious. The presence of multiple file creations and the use of directory traversal could be a sign of an attacker trying to set up persistence or execute commands in a stealthy manner. However, without additional evidence like execution of malicious code or network traffic, it's a moderate concern.\n\nSo, I'd lean towards classifying this as interesting for investigation because the pattern of activities, while not definitively malicious, shows behavior that could be part of an attack. The repetition and the use of PowerShell for file operations are red flags that warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits behavior that warrants investigation due to **repeated, structured use of PowerShell for file creation and modification**, combined with **directory traversal patterns** that may indicate evasion or persistence attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple events show PowerShell executing `New-Item` and `Set-Content` commands to create and write to batch files (e.g., `dir` as the content). This pattern suggests **automation** or **setup of persistent mechanisms**.\n   - The consistent use of `dir` (a basic directory listing command) in batch files could be a **placeholder** for more complex operations, or an attempt to execute low-impact commands to avoid detection.\n\n2. **Directory Traversal in Paths**:\n   - File paths like `modulo_secundario\\..\\pacote_base` include `..` (parent directory navigation), which may be used to **obfuscate file locations** or **bypass path-based security controls**.\n\n3. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Components**:\n   - Loading .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is **normal for .NET applications**, but when combined with the above file operations, it could indicate **tooling or scripting frameworks** being leveraged for malicious purposes.\n   - The presence of **Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll** is benign but may suggest the system is actively monitored, which could be relevant if the activity is part of a **malicious payload evading detection**.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Malicious Payload**:\n   - While the activities are not overtly malicious (e.g., no obvious exfiltration or encryption), the **repetition and structured approach** raise concerns about **preparation for further actions** (e.g., staged attacks, persistence, or command-and-control setup).\n\n---\n\n### **Classification**: **Interesting for Investigation**  \n- **Why?** The repeated, structured use of PowerShell for file operations, combined with directory traversal, suggests **potential for evasion or persistence**. While not definitively malicious, the pattern is inconsistent with typical user behavior and warrants deeper analysis (e.g., checking for additional network activity, registry changes, or execution of the created batch files).\n\n### **Confidence Level**: **Moderate**  \n- The activities are **not overtly harmful** but exhibit **behavioral anomalies** that could indicate **early-stage malicious activity** or **tooling abuse**. Further context (e.g., process tree, network traffic, or file contents) would clarify the intent."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command that creates a new item and sets content to a batch file. The command line uses New-Item and Set-Content, which are typical for creating files. The paths mentioned are a bit odd with the '..' directories, which might be trying to navigate up the directory tree. Not sure yet if that's malicious, but it's a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory, which is common for legitimate processes, but then immediately deleted. That could be part of a normal operation, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious code. However, since it's created and deleted quickly, maybe it's benign.\n\nThen there's a pipe created, which isn't too suspicious on its own. The next event shows another PowerShell command creating another batch file in a different path. Again, the use of '..' in the path might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual location. \n\nThe logs also show multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell when running scripts. However, the presence of multiple image loads could indicate that a script is loading various components, which might be part of a larger operation.\n\nThere's also a ProcessCreate event with a conditional check for a file's existence. That might be part of a script that's checking if a file exists before proceeding, which could be legitimate. But if that's part of a larger malicious payload, it might be something to look into.\n\nThe Registry value set events are a bit concerning. If PowerShell is modifying registry keys, that could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nLooking at all these events together, there's a pattern of PowerShell creating files, modifying the registry, and loading various DLLs. The use of '..' in file paths might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual paths, which is common in malicious scripts. However, some of these activities could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. \n\nBut the combination of multiple file creations, registry modifications, and the use of obfuscated paths does raise suspicion. The fact that the same process (PowerShell) is involved in multiple operations that could be part of a larger attack, like establishing persistence or executing commands, makes this batch interesting. However, I can't be 100% certain without more evidence.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing different system events. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries are related to PowerShell processes. The command lines are similar, using Test-Path to check for the existence of certain .bat files and exiting with 0 or 1. These paths seem a bit odd. They have parts like \"modulo_secundario\", \"elemento_padrao\", and other terms that might not be standard. The use of \"..\" in the paths could indicate directory traversal, which sometimes is used in attacks to navigate to parent directories. But I need to check if this is suspicious.\n\nThen, looking at the winlog tasks, most are \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\". I'm not too familiar with those specific tasks, but maybe they're related to system events or service lifecycle management. However, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are doing these checks might be normal, but maybe not. \n\nNext, there are some file events. One entry mentions a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts. However, another entry shows a file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which could be part of normal operations but might also be a red flag if it's unexpected. Also, there's a Pipe Created event, which might be part of normal communication but could be used for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's normal, so maybe that's just the system doing its thing. However, the combination of these events with the PowerShell scripts might be worth looking into. \n\nThe user mentioned that the classification should be based on the combination of all events. The repetition of similar PowerShell commands checking for specific .bat files in non-standard paths might indicate an attempt to check for the presence of certain files, possibly to determine if a payload exists. If these files are not found, the script exits with 1, which might be part of a larger attack chain. \n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. But the fact that there are multiple instances of such commands, combined with file creation and deletion in temp directories, could be indicative of some automated process or even a script trying to execute something. The use of \"Test-Path\" with parent directory references might be a way to check for files in different locations, possibly to bypass certain restrictions. \n\nBut I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Maybe this is just a normal script that's part of the system's configuration. However, the presence of multiple similar events with non-standard paths and the use of PowerShell for such checks might be more suspicious. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the batch is somewhat interesting but not definitively malicious. The confidence might be around 0.6. The justification is the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific .bat files in non-standard paths, along with file creation and deletion in temporary directories, which could indicate an attempt to execute or check for scripts.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several patterns that warrant further investigation, though definitive evidence of malicious activity is not present. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripts with Non-Standard Paths:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `Test-Path` to check for `.bat` files in paths containing terms like `modulo_secundario`, `elemento_padrao`, and `tarefa_comum`. These terms are not standard in typical Windows environments and may indicate custom or obfuscated scripts.\n   - The use of `..` in file paths (e.g., `modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..`) suggests directory traversal, which could be part of an attempt to access parent directories or bypass path restrictions.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temporary Directories:**\n   - A PowerShell process creates and immediately deletes a file in `AppData\\Local\\Temp`, a common tactic for transient script execution. While this is not inherently malicious, it raises questions about the purpose of the file.\n\n3. **Windows Defender DLLs:**\n   - Logs show loading of `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (part of Windows Defender). This is normal behavior and likely unrelated to suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Other System Events:**\n   - A `winlogbeat.exe` process creates a `.yml.new` file, which may be part of a legitimate configuration update or data collection process.\n   - Registry and process access events are common and lack specific indicators of compromise.\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- The repetitive use of PowerShell to check for `.bat` files in non-standard paths, combined with temporary file operations, could indicate an attempt to execute or verify the presence of payloads. While this could be part of a benign script, the lack of clear context (e.g., user-initiated actions or known legitimate processes) raises concerns.\n- The combination of these events with the absence of obvious benign explanations (e.g., user activity, software installation) increases the likelihood of requiring deeper investigation.\n\n### **Classification:**\n- **Interesting for Investigation (Likely Benign, but Requires Context):**  \n  The logs contain patterns that could align with both legitimate system behavior and early stages of an attack (e.g., probing for files, transient script execution). Without additional context (e.g., user intent, associated processes, or network activity), further analysis is warranted.\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n- **0.6 (Moderate):** The combination of repetitive PowerShell activity and file operations in temporary directories is suspicious but not conclusive. More data (e.g., network traffic, user context, or file content) would clarify the intent.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\nInvestigate the source of the PowerShell scripts, analyze the contents of the `.bat` files referenced in the `Test-Path` commands, and correlate these events with other system logs (e.g., network activity, user behavior) to determine if they are part of a legitimate process or an attack."}

This might be part of a script that's verifying if certain components are installed or present. However, the repetition of similar commands across different paths could indicate a pattern. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most are 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Process Create', which are typical for PowerShell scripts. The image loaded events include .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are standard for .NET applications. \n\nNow, considering the potential for malicious activity: checking for specific files could be part of a legitimate application's setup or health check. However, the lack of any clear malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying system settings makes it less suspicious. The repeated checks might be part of a larger script or application's initialization process. \n\nBut since all the events are related to checking file existence and standard .NET components, and there's no indication of exploitation or unauthorized access, it's more likely benign.

That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the specific events.\n\nThe first event mentions 'Image loaded' for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems legitimate. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1, followed by a delete event. Creating and deleting a script file might be normal, but maybe it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events could be suspicious. \n\nNext, there are several 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command lines checking if certain executables exist. The paths mentioned like C:\\registro_principal... and C:\\objeto_auxiliar... don't look standard. They might be trying to check for the presence of specific files, possibly as part of an attack or reconnaissance.\n\nThere are multiple 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' events. Changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the repeated 'Process accessed' events might indicate that PowerShell is being used to interact with other processes, which could be part of a malicious chain.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe and cmd.exe is normal, but the command lines are simple checks for file existence. However, when combined with the PowerShell activities, it might suggest an attempt to execute commands or scripts conditionally based on the presence of certain files.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple file creations and deletions in temporary directories, along with registry modifications, could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or modify system settings. The paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands are not standard, which might be a red flag.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be benign. For example, checking if a file exists is a common operation. But the combination of these events, especially the non-standard paths and the multiple registry and process access events, might indicate something more suspicious.\n\nThe confidence here isn't extremely high because some activities are normal, but the combination of events does raise flags.

There are multiple entries of 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. Also, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them is normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET.\n\nBut wait, there's also a 'Registry value set' event. That might be normal, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it could indicate something. Then, looking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands that check if specific files exist. The paths mentioned are all in different directories, like C:\\pacote_ativo, C:\\registro_principal, etc. These paths don't seem standard, and the files they're checking (like estrutura_temporario.cs, unidade_principal.cs) look like custom scripts or code files. \n\nThe pattern here is that PowerShell is being used to check for the existence of these files. If they're not present, the script exits with an error. But why are these checks happening multiple times? It might be part of a setup or installation process, but the repetition and the non-standard paths make me think it's not a normal operation. \n\nAlso, the 'Provider Lifecycle' events are a bit unclear. Maybe they're related to some security software or logging providers, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the other events, it's possible that these are part of a larger operation, maybe an attempt to deploy or execute code in a stealthy manner.\n\nI should consider if this is a known benign activity. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, but the combination of checking for specific files, loading .NET assemblies, and the number of events might indicate something malicious. The fact that the same PowerShell process is accessing the registry and loading multiple DLLs could be part of a payload execution or a persistence mechanism.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or executing suspicious commands. The events are all related to process creation, access, and image loading, which are normal for PowerShell. But the high frequency and the specific file checks might be indicative of a script that's trying to ensure certain files are in place before proceeding, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nSo, the classification here is a bit tricky. It's not clearly malicious, but the patterns are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the classification should be 'INTERESTING' with a confidence level around 0.7.

So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions the loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... and then it's deleted. That seems like a temporary file, maybe part of a script execution. But why create and delete it? Could be normal, but maybe suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Then several events with \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be part of PowerShell's normal operations, but I'm not sure. The command lines are checking if certain files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. That could be part of a script that's checking for dependencies or testing paths. However, the paths mentioned are all over the place, like C:\\estrutura_temporario, C:\\tarefa_padrao, etc. These don't look like standard directories. Maybe they're custom or part of some application, but the repeated use of \"Test-Path\" in different locations might be trying to check for specific files.\n\nThen there's a mention of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in several paths. Wait, \"Get-Keystrokes\" sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. That's a red flag. Even if the files aren't found, the fact that the scripts are named that way could indicate a bad actor trying to steal information. Also, the repeated attempts to check for these files in various directories might be part of an attack trying to locate where the malicious script is stored.\n\nAnother thing is the use of PowerShell for these operations. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in these scenarios, especially with scripts named Get-Keystrokes, is suspicious. The events also include registry value changes and process access, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nBut wait, some of the files mentioned are from Windows Defender, like MpClient.dll. That's a legitimate file, so those events might be normal. However, the combination of legitimate and potentially malicious activities needs to be considered. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts in multiple paths is concerning. Even if the scripts aren't found, the fact that the attacker is checking for them in various locations suggests they might be looking for a way to execute malicious code.\n\nAlso, the user is using temporary directories and creating\/deleting files, which is common in malware to avoid detection. The multiple instances of Test-Path could be part of a script that's trying to determine the environment or check for the presence of other malicious files.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch includes both normal activities (like Windows Defender files) and suspicious ones (scripts named Get-Keystrokes, multiple Test-Path checks in non-standard directories). The presence of keystroke logging scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Even though some events might be benign, the combination of these factors increases the likelihood of a security incident.

Loading these might be normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it's worth noting.

Alright, first, I'll go through each entry to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known location for PowerShell profiles, so maybe that's normal. But I should check if there's anything unusual about the file creation.\n\nNext, there are several entries about registry value sets and process accesses involving powershell.exe. Multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that PowerShell is being monitored or manipulated, but not necessarily malicious. However, repeated access could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so probably benign. But if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe not. The same goes for notepad.exe and calc.exe, which are common utilities. However, the ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll are normal since that's a legitimate Windows DLL.\n\nLooking at the winlogbeat.exe event, it created a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That could be part of a configuration update, but if the file wasn't expected, it might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are multiple NetworkConnect events from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making network connections is normal, especially if the user is browsing. Svchost.exe is a system process, so those connections could be legitimate, but if they're going to unexpected destinations, that's a problem. However, the events don't specify the destination, so I can't confirm that.\n\nThe DnsQuery event from chrome.exe is also normal. Without seeing the queried domains, it's hard to assess. But if there were any unusual domains, that would be a clue.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The main points are the repeated PowerShell activities, the file creation in a specific directory, and the network connections. However, none of the events seem to indicate clear malicious activity. The presence of legitimate processes and normal system files (like urlmon.dll) suggests that these are routine operations. The only potential red flag is the file created by winlogbeat, but that's part of a monitoring tool's operation.\n\nSince there's no evidence of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or unusual command-line arguments (except for the whoami.exe, which is normal), I don't see enough to classify this as interesting.

Browsing the web would involve DNS lookups. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. Process access events are common, but when combined with other events, they might indicate something. Next, whoami.exe is executed. That's a legitimate command to get user info, but maybe in a suspicious context?\n\nLooking further, there are several ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe. The command lines show things like ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. Those are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. Maybe the user is just exploring the file system, but why so many times?\n\nThen there are ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from .NET Framework and Windows Defender.

That seems legitimate, but maybe if there's something unusual about how it's being used? Not sure yet. Then there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal if the user is setting up winlogbeat. But creating a .yml.new file could be part of configuration, but maybe that's not suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows a file created in the user's AppData directory with a name like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used for automation. But again, not necessarily malicious. Then there are registry value set events for powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values could be part of configuration or could be part of persistence mechanisms if done maliciously.\n\nThere's also a file created called estrutura_secundario.txt.
