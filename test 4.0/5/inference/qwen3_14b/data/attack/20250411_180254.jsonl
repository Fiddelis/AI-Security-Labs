{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, systeminfo.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, WmiPrvSE.exe, and others. Now, some of these are common system processes, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are often used in attacks. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that runs systeminfo and reg query on the Disk Enum registry key. That might be trying to gather information about the system's disks. Also, there's a reg.exe process querying the same registry path. That seems like reconnaissance, which is a red flag.\n\nThen there's systeminfo.exe being executed, which is normal, but the image loaded includes amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. But if it's being loaded by a suspicious process, maybe that's an issue. However, in this case, systeminfo.exe is the one loading it, which might be okay. But I should check if there are any other unusual image loads.\n\nLooking at the image loads, there's also urlmon.dll loaded by calc.exe and Calculator.exe. Urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer's URLMoniker, which is used for downloading files. If a calculator process is loading that, it might be malicious. But Calculator.exe is a legitimate process, though maybe it's been compromised here. However, the same dll is loaded by both calc.exe and Calculator.exe, which could be a sign of something trying to download or interact with external resources.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value set events by processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. The fact that so many different processes are modifying the registry might indicate an attack.\n\nAdditionally, svchost.exe is creating files in the Windows Event Logs directory. While svchost is a normal process, creating event logs might be unusual. However, the files created are Parameters.evtx and State.evtx. I'm not sure if that's normal. Maybe part of a legitimate service, but it's worth noting.\n\nThere's also a WmiPrvSE.exe process, which is related to WMI. WMI is often used by attackers for remote management and execution. The command line includes -secured and -Embedding, which might be part of a legitimate WMI operation, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a concern.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry modifications, use of cmd and powershell for querying system info and registry, loading of dlls that are associated with downloading or scanning, and svchost creating event logs. These could be signs of an attacker gathering information, modifying the system, and possibly establishing persistence. However, some of these activities might be benign. But given the combination of events, especially the registry changes and the use of command-line tools for system enumeration, it seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7 or 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: cmd.exe and reg.exe querying registry keys related to disk enumeration, systeminfo.exe loaded with amsi.dll (potential evasion), svchost.exe creating event log files, and PowerShell\/cmd.exe process access events. These may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. Maybe the user is just installing or configuring it. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe modifying registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, but if it's doing registry changes, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, like what specific registry keys are being changed, it's hard to tell. Maybe legitimate scripts are running.\n\nLooking further, chrome.exe is involved in multiple events. It's creating pipes, loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Chrome loading these DLLs might be part of its normal operations, like interacting with the antivirus. But why so many registry changes? Chrome might be updating its settings, but repeated registry modifications could be a sign of something else, like a browser hijacker or malicious extension.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_padrao.txt. The name doesn't ring any bells, but again, without knowing the content or context, it's hard to judge. Maybe it's a normal file, or maybe it's part of an attack.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, some file creations, and the use of PowerShell. However, none of the events seem to involve known malicious activities. The file paths are in standard directories, and the processes involved are typical. The repetition of registry events might be a bit unusual, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nI should check if there's any indication of privilege escalation, unusual command-line arguments, or network activity. But the logs provided don't include that info. The events are all about file creation and registry changes. Without additional context, it's hard to confirm if this is malicious. However, the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe and the presence of PowerShell could be worth investigating further. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the batch is interesting, and considering that there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here, maybe it's just normal operations. However, the repetition and the involvement of PowerShell might still be a point of interest. I'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because the logs don't confirm malicious intent, but the patterns are unusual enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. While some activity (e.g., winlogbeat file creation) appears legitimate, the high frequency of registry changes by chrome.exe and the presence of PowerShell may indicate potential configuration changes or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a single event in JSONL format. The event shows that chrome.exe is involved in a registry value set event. The task is to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what's normal. Chrome.exe is a legitimate process, but it's also common for malware to inject into or mimic chrome.exe. However, the event here is a registry value being set. Registry changes can be normal, like updates or software installations, but they can also be part of malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms.\n\nBut wait, the event is a single entry. The user's instruction says to analyze the entire batch as a whole. Since there's only one event, I need to see if this single event is enough to be considered interesting. Typically, a single registry change by chrome.exe might not be suspicious on its own. However, if there are multiple such events or other suspicious activities, that would be more concerning. \n\nThe justification needs to be concise. The confidence should reflect that with only one event, it's not highly suspicious. Maybe 0.3? Because it's a single event and chrome.exe is a common process. However, if the registry change is to a specific key that's commonly abused, that might increase the score, but the data here doesn't specify the key. \n\nSo, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's insufficient information. The justification would be that a single registry event by a legitimate process isn't enough to warrant investigation. Confidence around 0.3 or 0.4.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Single registry event by chrome.exe (legitimate process) without additional suspicious context\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
