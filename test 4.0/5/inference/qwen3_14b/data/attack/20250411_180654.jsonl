{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll note it.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Multiple times, but chrome doing registry changes could be normal, but maybe if it's excessive? However, the same action repeated multiple times might be worth checking. But I need more context.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. That's probably just a normal system check. Not a red flag.\n\nNow, looking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds like it's capturing keystrokes, which is a classic sign of malware. Keyloggers are malicious, so this is a big red flag. Even if the script is legitimate, the name and the action of logging keystrokes without user consent are suspicious.\n\nAlso, the image loaded events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, so loading them is normal for PowerShell scripts. But the combination with the keystroke logging script is concerning.\n\nThe other events with Provider Lifecycle task might be related to PowerShell's execution, but without more info, they might not be harmful on their own.\n\nSo the main issue here is the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. Even if the script isn't actually malicious, the name and the action of logging keystrokes are highly suspicious. Therefore, this batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing keystroke logging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and loading .NET framework DLLs, which is highly suspicious behavior indicative of potential malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. A lot of them involve PowerShell.exe, which is common but can be a red flag if used maliciously. The command lines in several entries include executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path pointing to the TEMP directory. That script name sounds suspicious because \"keystrokes\" might imply keylogging, which is a common malicious activity. The fact that multiple events are using this script from different paths might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing the location each time.\n\nThen there are events about files being created and deleted, like the temporary files in the AppData directory. That's normal for some operations, but combined with the PowerShell scripts, it could be part of a larger attack. Also, the logs mention the Defender DLLs being loaded, which might be legitimate, but the presence of multiple PowerShell activities could be a sign of something malicious trying to bypass security software.\n\nThe classification here seems to be pointing towards INTERESTING because of the repeated use of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script, which is a strong indicator of potential keylogging. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these factors raises a red flag. The confidence is high because the pattern is consistent across multiple entries, even if some parts are benign. The justification would be the repeated execution of the same script with a keystroke logging purpose, which is a clear sign of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with a log path to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keylogging activity. The script's repeated execution from different paths suggests evasion tactics, while temporary file creation\/deletion may indicate malicious payload handling.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these three events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each one individually.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file in C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. Hmm, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The file path is under DeliveryOptimization, which I think is related to Windows Update and file sharing. The file name keyValueLKG.dat sounds like a normal system file. This might be a legitimate activity, maybe part of system updates or something similar. Not sure yet, but not obviously malicious.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which seems like a configuration file being created. This could be part of installing or configuring Winlogbeat. If the user downloaded and is setting up Winlogbeat, this is normal. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity here. Maybe the file creation is part of a normal setup process, so not necessarily suspicious.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe created a file called entrada_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is a common tool, but its use can be both legitimate and malicious. The file name is in Portuguese, \"entrada_padrao\" means \"default input\" or \"standard input.\" The file itself is just a text file. Without more context, like the content of the file or other associated events, this might be benign. Maybe the user is running a script that generates this file. However, if this is part of a larger set of activities, like downloading and executing malicious scripts, it could be a red flag. But on its own, it's not clear.\n\nNow, looking at the batch as a whole. All three events are file creations by different processes. The first one is a system process, the second a legitimate tool, and the third a common utility. There's no obvious connection between them. No signs of suspicious file paths, unexpected processes, or unusual activities. The files created are either in standard system directories or user downloads, which are common. No mention of network activity, user logins, or other events that might indicate compromise. \n\nI should check if any of these files are in directories that are typically used by malware. The first one is in a system path, but that's normal for some services. The second is in the user's Downloads, which is common for legitimate software installation. The third is also in Downloads, which could be part of a user's own activities. \n\nNo anomalies in the processes involved. Svchost, winlogbeat, and powershell are all legitimate. The file names don't seem to be known malware files. There's no indication of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration. \n\nSince there's no suspicious pattern or combination of events that would indicate a security threat, this batch is likely not interesting. The confidence is medium because while there's no clear malicious activity, the absence of suspicious signs makes it not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in standard system or user directories. No suspicious file paths, unexpected process behavior, or security-relevant anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
