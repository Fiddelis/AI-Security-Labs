{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing DNS queries and MpDefenderCoreService.exe having network connections. Those seem normal. Chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections is common too. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. \n\nWait, looking at the command line for one of the cmd.exe processes: it's adding a user called \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to the domain, and then adding that user to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a significant security risk. Also, the passwords look like they might be temporary, which is suspicious. \n\nThen there's another cmd.exe command adding another user \"unidade_comum_Admin\" and adding them to Domain Admins. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a typo or a malicious replacement. Also, the file creation events include a .yml.new file for winlogbeat and a pacote_base.txt. The .yml.new could be part of a configuration change, but combined with the user creation commands, it might indicate someone trying to set up a backdoor or modify logging settings to hide their activities.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe for creating users and modifying registry values is concerning. The presence of multiple user additions to Domain Admins suggests a potential compromise where an attacker is elevating privileges. The fact that these commands are being executed with domain admin rights is a big issue. \n\nAlso, the winlogbeat file creation might be an attempt to configure or tamper with the log shipping tool, possibly to exfiltrate data or avoid detection. The combination of these events—unusual user creation, elevation to admin, and file modifications—points to a possible security incident. \n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The processes like svchost.exe and chrome.exe are normal, but the malicious activities are coming from cmd and powershell. The confidence here is pretty high because creating domain admin accounts is a clear sign of compromise. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net.exe'\/'net1.exe' with weak passwords, repeated use of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' for privilege escalation, and potential log tampering (winlogbeat config file creation). These indicate possible unauthorized access and lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these events. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is a temporary file related to the System Resource Usage (SRU) feature, which is part of Windows' performance monitoring. This might be normal system activity, but sometimes attackers mimic legitimate processes. \n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file could be part of its setup. However, the presence of a new config file might indicate someone is configuring it, which isn't necessarily malicious but could be if done unexpectedly.\n\nThird and fourth events are about powershell.exe interacting with the registry and accessing a process. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attacks. However, without more context, like unusual registry changes or accessing sensitive processes, it's hard to tell. \n\nLooking at all events together, there's no clear pattern of malicious activity. The first event's file path is legitimate, the second is a normal config file creation, and the PowerShell events don't show obvious signs of compromise. The confidence is low because there's no strong evidence of an attack. So, classification is NOT INTERESTING with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal system activity (svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log), legitimate software installation (winlogbeat config file), and common administrative actions (PowerShell registry\/process access) without suspicious patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
