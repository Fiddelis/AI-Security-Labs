{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all have process commands with PowerShell. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, setting triggers at logon, and specifying the Administrators group with highest run level. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges and running calc.exe (which is a legitimate but often used in malicious contexts) might indicate something suspicious.\n\nWait, calc.exe is a normal Windows calculator, but if it's being triggered by a scheduled task with admin rights, that's not typical. Usually, attackers use calc.exe as a test to see if their payload works. Also, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with similar names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc., might be part of an attempt to establish persistence. \n\nThen there are entries about PowerShell processes, registry value sets, and process accesses. The ImageLoad events mention mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to .NET Framework. While these are legitimate, if they're being loaded in an unexpected context, it could be part of a malicious payload. However, the main concern here is the scheduled task creation.\n\nThe fact that multiple scheduled tasks are being registered with high privileges and using calc.exe suggests that this might be a staged attack. The attacker could be testing if they can execute arbitrary code under admin rights. Also, the repetition of similar commands across different events might indicate an automated script or tool being used to deploy these tasks.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there are any false positives. For example, legitimate software might create scheduled tasks, but the use of calc.exe here is unusual. Typically, scheduled tasks would run more meaningful executables. Also, the use of the Administrators group with highest run level is a strong indicator of potential privilege escalation attempts.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows multiple suspicious activities related to scheduled tasks with admin privileges and unusual command lines. The confidence level is high because these actions are not normal and align with common attack patterns. So, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) targeting the Administrators group, executing calc.exe. This pattern is indicative of potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or escalate privileges.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry. The first few entries are about PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are all legitimate .NET Framework files, so loading them might be normal. But I should note that multiple image loads from PowerShell could be part of normal operations or possibly malicious if unexpected.\n\nNext, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a script that's trying to execute something and then clean up. But sometimes, temporary files are created and deleted as part of normal processes. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to PowerShell script execution policies. Maybe a test, but maybe also a way to bypass policies.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event with no file involved. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. \n\nThe next event is a PowerShell command line that's creating a scheduled task. The command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe at logon, sets the principal to Administrators with high privileges, and registers the task. This seems suspicious because running calc.exe via a scheduled task with admin rights might be a test or a way to execute arbitrary code. However, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but using it in this context could be a sign of someone trying to escalate privileges or execute commands. The use of \"estrutura_auxiliar$object\" in the command might be a typo or obfuscation.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events from chrome.exe. Multiple registry changes could be indicative of malware modifying system settings, but Chrome itself might make registry changes during updates or configuration. However, repeated events might be a sign of something unusual.\n\nThe rest of the entries are about \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process information. These could be signs of remote code execution attempts, but without more details, it's hard to confirm. If there are multiple such events, it might indicate a potential attack vector being exploited.\n\nPutting this all together: The PowerShell activities, including loading DLLs, creating\/deleting files, and setting up a scheduled task, could be part of a legitimate script or a malicious payload. The scheduled task example is particularly noteworthy because creating a task with admin privileges might be a way to maintain persistence. The registry changes from Chrome and the remote command executions are also concerning. However, some of these events could be normal, especially the .NET DLL loads and Chrome's registry activity.\n\nBut the combination of creating a temporary script file, deleting it, and then setting up a scheduled task with elevated privileges might point to an attempt to execute arbitrary code. The presence of \"Execute a Remote Command\" events without a process might indicate that someone is trying to execute commands remotely, which is a clear sign of potential compromise.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch has several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the combination of the scheduled task, file creation\/deletion, and remote command executions makes this interesting enough for a security team to look into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include loading .NET DLLs, creating\/deleting a temporary script file, and attempting to register a scheduled task with administrative privileges. Additionally, numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events without process context suggest potential lateral movement or exploitation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of entries where the process is \"None\" and the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's repeated multiple times. Hmm, that might be a red flag. But wait, maybe there's a reason for that. However, if there are multiple instances of the same event without any variation, it could be a sign of something automated or even a false positive. But I need to check other entries too.\n\nLooking further down, there's an entry with process details: powershell.exe executing a command to create a scheduled task. The command line shows creating a task named \"unidade_comum\" with the action to run calc.exe. The principal is set to Administrators with high privileges. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the path mentioned is in the System32 directory, which is normal, but the task name might be something unusual.\n\nThen there's an entry where WmiPrvSE.exe (Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service) loads taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded in an unexpected context, it could be a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, svchost.exe is involved in registry value sets. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so registry changes here might be normal, but if there's a pattern, it could indicate something. However, there are multiple entries here, which might just be normal system operations.\n\nAnother entry shows svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum\". Wait, earlier there was a scheduled task with the same name. That seems connected. Creating a scheduled task and then a file with the same name in the Tasks directory might be part of the same operation. That's a bit suspicious.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for some legitimate activities, but could also be part of malicious scripts. However, the filename is \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\", which might be related to PowerShell profiles, which are legitimate but sometimes abused.\n\nOther entries involve chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files related to Windows Defender and Anti-Virus, so that's probably normal. Chrome loading them might be part of its interaction with the system's security features.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which might be less typical. However, maybe the user is setting up the tool there.\n\nPutting this all together: The main suspicious points are the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events, the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with admin rights, and the creation of the task file. However, the other entries don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The repetition of \"Execute a Remote Command\" might be a false positive if it's part of a normal process, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some suspicious events, they might not be enough on their own to confirm malicious intent without more context. But since the user is asking for investigation, the presence of these events makes it interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell creating a scheduled task with admin privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators) and unusual file creation in system directories.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the events. There are a bunch of entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's repeated multiple times. Then there's one entry with chrome.exe doing a DNS query, another with winlogbeat.exe creating a file, and another with powershell.exe creating a file.\n\nHmm, chrome.exe modifying the registry a lot. Normally, Chrome might make some registry changes, but doing it repeatedly could be suspicious. But maybe it's just normal operations. However, the repetition might indicate something. Then the DNS query from chrome.exe could be normal, but maybe not. The other two events are about file creation. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of its normal setup. The powershell.exe creating a text file. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a file might be normal unless it's something malicious.\n\nWait, but looking at the paths: the winlogbeat file is in a Downloads directory, which might be okay. The objeto_auxiliar.txt is also in Downloads. But maybe the user is just doing normal stuff. However, the multiple registry changes by Chrome could be a red flag. But I need to check if there's a pattern here. Are these all part of a legitimate process, or is there something off? Also, the presence of both winlogbeat and powershell might be normal, but combined with the Chrome events?\n\nI'm not sure. The repetition of registry changes might be more concerning. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or the content of the DNS query, it's hard to tell. But since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, maybe the multiple registry events by Chrome are enough to flag it as interesting. The other events don't seem immediately suspicious. So, the classification might be INTERESTING with a moderate confidence because of the repeated registry modifications by Chrome, which could indicate a potential issue, even though it's not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated 'Registry value set' operations, which could indicate unusual behavior or potential malicious activity.
