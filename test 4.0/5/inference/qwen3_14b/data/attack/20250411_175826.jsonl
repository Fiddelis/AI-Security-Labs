{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's powershell.exe appearing several times. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with a command line that seems to be modifying a file's last write time. The command line has some strange paths with double backslashes and quotes. That might be an indicator of something trying to hide its tracks by altering file timestamps. Also, the file path mentioned, \"C:\\\\registro_logico\\\\...\", looks a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo or a red herring, but the fact that it's changing timestamps could be suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple image load events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs, which is normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but loading it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's common, but the filename \"__PSScriptPolicyTest...\" might be related to a script that was executed and then deleted. If the script was malicious, deleting it afterward could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could be part of inter-process communication. Not inherently bad, but combined with other events, it might be worth looking into.\n\nNow, considering all these points: the PowerShell activities, the file timestamp modification, the temporary script file, and the multiple registry and process access events. While some of these could be legitimate, the combination might indicate an attempt to execute a script, modify system files, or evade detection. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to tell. The presence of Windows Defender's DLL being loaded is a good sign, but the overall pattern of multiple PowerShell events with unusual command lines and file operations could be a red flag.\n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there are enough suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The confidence is around 0.7 because while there are signs of potential malicious behavior, it's not definitive without more evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file timestamp modification, temporary script creation\/deletion, and unusual registry operations. Combined with network activity and DLL loading, this suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is looking for patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There are several instances of powershell.exe being used with commands that modify the LastWriteTime of files to a specific date, which is 01\/01\/1970. That date is significant because it's the Unix epoch, often used in hacking contexts. Changing file timestamps could be an attempt to hide the true time of file modifications, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all follow a similar structure: using Get-ChildItem to find files and then setting their LastWriteTime. The paths mentioned are a mix of system directories and user-specific ones. The fact that this is done multiple times across different directories might indicate a systematic effort to alter timestamps, possibly to cover tracks after some activity.\n\nThen there are other processes like calc.exe and svchost.exe, but those seem normal. The svchost.exe entries are about registry value sets, which can be normal system operations. The winlogbeat entry is about creating a file, which might be part of a legitimate tool's operation, but the presence of multiple PowerShell activities is more suspicious.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated use of PowerShell to modify file timestamps to a known epoch date. This is a red flag. Even though some entries are normal, the combination of multiple suspicious PowerShell commands suggests someone might be trying to manipulate the system. The confidence here is medium because while the actions are suspicious, they could be part of a legitimate script if not for the specific date and repetition. But without more context, the pattern leans towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file LastWriteTime attributes to '01\/01\/1970 00:00:00' (Unix epoch), a common tactic used in malware to obfuscate file timestamps.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about registry value sets, which is common in normal system operations, but when combined with other activities, they might indicate something. There are entries for ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe. Chrome.exe has a lot of entries, especially registry changes. But wait, there's also a mention of Image loaded events. Let me check those.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, one entry shows 'amsi.dll' being loaded by chrome.exe. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded by chrome.exe, maybe that's unusual. However, I should consider if this is normal behavior. Chrome might interact with system components, but maybe not loading amsi.dll directly.\n\nAnother image load event points to 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's also a legitimate file. But again, if chrome.exe is loading these, is that normal? Maybe not. However, I need more context. Are there other suspicious activities?\n\nThere's a file created event for 'unidade_logico.txt' by powershell.exe. Creating a text file isn't inherently malicious, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like data exfiltration or logging malicious activities, it could be a red flag. However, on its own, it's not conclusive.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file is part of the log shipping process, which is normal if they're configuring it. But maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. Chrome.exe has multiple registry value set events. While registry changes are common, an excessive number might indicate something like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The events include normal activities (like Calculator.exe, registry changes), some image loads of legitimate files, and a file creation. However, the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe and the image loads might be worth investigating. But are they enough to classify as interesting? Maybe, but I need to check if there's anything more suspicious.\n\nWait, there's also a process with no name in one of the entries. That might be an indicator of something, but the rest of the logs don't show other anomalies. Also, the presence of both legitimate and normal activities might dilute the suspicion. However, the combination of multiple registry changes and image loads could be part of a larger attack, like trying to modify system settings or inject code.\n\nBut I'm not seeing clear signs of malicious activity. The justification might be that there are multiple registry changes and image loads, but without more context, it's not conclusive. However, the presence of these events could be a sign worth looking into further. So, maybe the classification is INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with image load events for system files (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), suggest potential system manipulation or evasion techniques.
