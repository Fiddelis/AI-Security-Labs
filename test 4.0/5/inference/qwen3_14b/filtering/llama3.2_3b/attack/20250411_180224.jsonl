The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The task is set to run daily under the system account, and the trigger is a PowerShell script that's supposed to run. The script path is mentioned as c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That might be a red flag because if the script doesn't exist, this could be a failed attempt or a misconfiguration. But maybe the attacker is trying to hide the real script name?\n\nNext, there's another event with schtasks.exe creating a scheduled task again, this time with a different script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is suspicious. Scheduled tasks running PowerShell scripts with non-existent files might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code, but if the files don't exist, it might not be successful. However, sometimes attackers use such names to avoid detection, or maybe the scripts are hidden elsewhere.\n\nThen there are events where schtasks.exe is being loaded as an image, which is normal since it's a legitimate Windows utility. The file path is the standard taskschd.dll, so that's expected. The query of the scheduled task \"win32times\" is also a normal action, but the name \"win32times\" might be a bit odd. Legitimate tasks might have more descriptive names, but it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe cmd.exe event with a registry value set could be part of configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to say. Then there are file creation events related to winlogbeat and some text files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. The PowerShell events creating files like estrutura_geral.txt and entrada_ativo.txt might be part of legitimate activities, but again, without knowing the content, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is a standard tool to check user context, so that's normal. However, the combination of scheduled tasks set to run as system with PowerShell scripts that don't exist might be a sign of something malicious. Maybe the attacker is trying to set up a scheduled task that's supposed to run a script, but the script is missing, which could be a failed attack or a setup that's not yet completed.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the scheduled tasks are set to run daily, which is unusual for some scripts unless they're part of a legitimate maintenance task. However, the use of \"-ep bypass\" in PowerShell is a common technique to bypass execution policies, which is often seen in malicious scripts. Even though the script files are named as non-existing, the command line suggests an attempt to execute PowerShell with bypassed execution policies, which is a red flag.\n\nThe presence of multiple schtasks.exe processes creating and querying the same task \"win32times\" might indicate that someone is trying to manipulate or check the status of the task. Also, the fact that the same task is being created multiple times could be an attempt to ensure it's set up correctly, even if the script isn't present.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell commands that bypass execution policies, using non-existent script files, and multiple attempts to create and query the same task might indicate an attempted intrusion or a malicious activity. However, since the scripts don't exist, it might not be a successful attack yet. But the suspicious elements are enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks are created with PowerShell commands using '-ep bypass' (bypass execution policy), pointing to non-existent scripts. This suggests potential malicious activity attempting to execute hidden scripts under the SYSTEM account.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
