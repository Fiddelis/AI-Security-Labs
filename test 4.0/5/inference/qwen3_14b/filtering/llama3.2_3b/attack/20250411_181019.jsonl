The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's cmd.exe and sc.exe creating a service called win32times with a command line that includes starting a PowerShell script. The paths mentioned, like c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1, seem suspicious because they have \"NonExistingScript\" in the names. That might be a red flag, suggesting the attacker is trying to execute a script that doesn't actually exist, which could be part of a larger attack plan.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and sc.exe being used, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. The registry events from services.exe might indicate changes to system configurations, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nOther events involve calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a normal system file, so that might not be suspicious. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file is likely part of log collection, so that's probably benign. Chrome.exe events are typical for a browser, so those don't stand out.\n\nThe key points here are the attempts to create a service with a command that references non-existent scripts. This could be an indicator of an attack trying to establish persistence or execute malicious code. However, since the scripts don't exist, maybe the attack failed, or it's a decoy. But the fact that these commands are being executed is still noteworthy.\n\nI should check if there are other signs of compromise. The registry changes by services.exe could be part of that. But without more evidence like network connections or unusual file creations, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the combination of creating a service with a non-existent script and using sc.exe multiple times might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show attempts to create a Windows service (win32times) with command lines referencing non-existent PowerShell scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), which may indicate an attempt to execute malicious payloads or establish persistence. The use of 'sc.exe' and 'cmd.exe' in conjunction with registry modifications by 'services.exe' raises suspicion of potential system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
