{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances of powershell.exe being executed with command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The command lines use PowerShell cmdlets like New-ScheduledTaskAction, New-ScheduledTaskTrigger, and Register-ScheduledTask. The tasks are set to run calc.exe at logon, which is a common indicator of malicious activity because calc.exe is a legitimate tool but often used in attacks to test if a task can be created.\n\nThe scheduled tasks are registered under different names like \"entrada_ativo\", \"entrada_temporario\", \"tarefa_geral\", and \"estrutura_auxiliar\". The user group specified is \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" with the highest run level, which means the task has elevated privileges. This is a red flag because creating a scheduled task with admin rights can be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism.\n\nThere are also multiple entries under \"Execute a Remote Command\" task, but the process field is \"None\" for those. That might indicate that the system is trying to execute remote commands, but there's no process information available. However, without more context, it's a bit unclear. But combined with the PowerShell scheduled tasks, it might suggest some form of remote access or command execution attempts.\n\nThe other events include image loads of .NET DLLs, which are normal for PowerShell operations, but the File Delete event for a temporary script file might be part of cleanup after executing a script. However, the presence of multiple scheduled task creations with admin rights is more concerning.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The Chrome.exe entries are related to registry changes, but those might be benign. However, the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events could be indicative of something else, but without process details, it's hard to say. \n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious activity is the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges using PowerShell, which is a common technique in attacks. Even though some events are not directly linked to malicious activity, the combination of these PowerShell commands and the elevated permissions makes this batch worth investigating. The confidence is high because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights is a known attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) targeting Administrators group, which is a common technique for persistence and privilege escalation in attacks. The repeated registration of tasks with calc.exe execution further indicates potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about executing a remote command with no process or file specified. That's a bit vague, but maybe a placeholder or incomplete log.\n\nNext, there's a file created by PowerShell in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known location for PowerShell profiles, which could be normal, but creating a file there might be part of setting up a profile. However, if it's unexpected, it could be suspicious.\n\nThen, PowerShell and conhost.exe are setting registry values. Registry changes can be part of normal operations, but if done by unexpected processes, it might indicate something malicious. Conhost.exe is usually a helper for console windows, so maybe that's normal here.\n\nChrome.exe is loading amsi.dll, which is a legitimate file for antivirus scanning. But if it's being loaded from an unexpected path or by a process that shouldn't be doing that, it could be a red flag. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll, which is correct, so that might be normal.\n\nChrome.exe also setting a registry value and making a DNS query. DNS queries are normal, but if they're going to suspicious domains, that would be a concern. However, the log doesn't mention the domain, so we can't tell from this data.\n\nAnother file created by PowerShell in the Downloads directory, which is more common for user activities. But if the file is named something unusual, like \"objeto_auxiliar.txt,\" maybe that's a red herring or part of a legitimate process.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of normal activities and some that could be suspicious. The key points are the remote command execution, registry changes by PowerShell and conhost.exe, and the file creation in the StartupProfileData. However, without more context like unexpected domains in DNS queries or other malicious indicators, it's hard to be certain. The confidence here is moderate because there are some potentially suspicious actions, but they could also be part of normal user behavior. So I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" but with a confidence around 0.6, as there are enough points to warrant further investigation but not conclusive evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes created files in user-specific directories and modified registry values, which may indicate configuration changes or persistence attempts. Chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll (legitimate but值得关注 if unexpected). No clear malicious payload detected, but anomalous activity patterns exist.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
