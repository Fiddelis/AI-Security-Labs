{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating multiple JavaScript files in a specific directory under Microsoft Office's Resources folder. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min.js with various hash-like suffixes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses helper processes, but I should check if this is a known legitimate process. Maybe it's part of Microsoft Office or another application. However, the fact that it's creating so many files with similar names might be suspicious. Legitimate processes usually don't generate that many files in a short period, especially with random-looking hashes.\n\nNext, looking at the file paths: they're all in the same directory, which is under the user's AppData. That's a common place for both legitimate and malicious software. The files are minified JavaScript, which is normal for web apps, but again, the quantity here seems off. Also, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files could indicate something like a downloader or a dropper, which is common in malware.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the files are all named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" but different suffixes. That might be an attempt to obfuscate the filenames, making it harder to detect. The use of \"aicopilot\" could be a typo or a misdirection. I should check if \"aicopilot\" is related to any known software. Maybe it's a misspelling of \"AI Copilot,\" which is a feature in some Microsoft products. If that's the case, maybe these files are related to that feature. However, the large number of files and the repetitive creation might still be a red flag.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that this is part of a legitimate update or installation process. For example, if a new version of Office is being installed, it might generate temporary files. But usually, such processes would have more varied process names and might not generate so many files with similar names. Also, the logs don't mention any other processes or services that might be involved in an installation.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, if all these events happened in a short time frame, that could indicate a rapid file creation, which is often associated with malware. However, without timestamps, it's hard to tell. The repetition of the same process and the same directory might be a sign of something malicious trying to leave a footprint.\n\nAnother angle is to check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate file. A quick search in my knowledge base: SDXHelper is sometimes part of software development kits or tools, but not commonly associated with Microsoft Office. If it's not a known legitimate process, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these files are created by the same process without any variation in the process name could indicate that the process is being used to generate these files, which might be part of a payload or a setup for further malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, while it's possible that this is a legitimate process generating files, the combination of the same process creating numerous files in a specific directory with similar names, especially with obfuscated filenames, leans towards this being suspicious. Further investigation would be needed, such as checking the file contents, verifying the process's legitimacy, and looking for other signs of malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is repeatedly creating multiple **minified JavaScript files** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` with unique hash-like suffixes) in the directory:  \n`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Resources\\`.  \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **High Volume of Files**:  \n   - Over **20 files** are created in a short period, all with similar naming patterns. This is unusual for legitimate processes, which typically do not generate such a large number of files in this manner.\n\n2. **File Naming and Obfuscation**:  \n   - Filenames include `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` with random-looking hash suffixes (e.g., `0baa481369488cbce9c3d5207010a50d`). This pattern is common in **malware** to evade detection or mimic legitimate software (e.g., `aicopilot` may be a misspelling of \"AI Copilot,\" a Microsoft feature, but the repetition suggests obfuscation).\n\n3. **Process Behavior**:  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a well-known legitimate process. While some legitimate tools may use similar names, the repetitive file creation and lack of variation in process behavior raise suspicion.  \n\n4. **Location**:  \n   - The files are stored in the **Microsoft Office resources directory**, which could indicate an attempt to mimic or exploit Office-related processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**:\n- **Malware Activity**: The behavior aligns with **malware droppers** or **downloaders** that generate temporary files or payloads.  \n- **Persistence or Payload Delivery**: The files could be part of a larger malicious chain (e.g., staged payloads, configuration files, or obfuscated scripts).  \n- **Legitimacy Uncertainty**: If **SDXHelper.exe** is not a known legitimate process, this could indicate a **false positive** (e.g., a misconfigured tool) or **malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**:\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:  \n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to check if **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate file (e.g., check its digital signature, location, and parent process).\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:  \n   - Use a hex editor or antivirus sandbox to inspect the contents of the `.min.js` files for malicious code (e.g., embedded scripts, URLs, or obfuscated payloads).\n\n3. **Check for Malware**:  \n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/anti-malware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, Kaspersky).\n\n4. **Monitor Network Activity**:  \n   - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Microsoft Network Monitor** to check if **SDXHelper.exe** is communicating with suspicious domains or IPs.\n\n5. **Isolate the System**:  \n   - If malware is suspected, isolate the system and avoid running untrusted processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nWhile the logs could theoretically represent a legitimate process (e.g., a misconfigured tool or update), the **high volume of files**, **obfuscated filenames**, and **unusual process behavior** strongly suggest **malicious activity**. Further investigation is critical to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or a **security threat**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of entries, most of which are about files being created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files are all JavaScript files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" and various hash-like suffixes. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's normal here. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, perhaps a helper for an application? The fact that it's creating so many files in the Office directory might be a red flag. But then again, maybe it's part of a legitimate update or installation process.\n\nLooking at the file paths: they're all under \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Resources\\...\". That seems like a standard location for Office-related files. However, the fact that there are so many files being created, and each with a different hash, might indicate something. If it's a legitimate process, maybe it's downloading resources or updates. But the repetition of the same process creating multiple files could also be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the process is known. I can think of some malware that uses similar naming conventions or creates a lot of files in system directories. However, without more information, it's hard to tell. The presence of \"officeaicopilot\" in the filenames makes me think it might be related to Microsoft Office, but I'm not sure. Maybe a third-party add-in or something else.\n\nAlso, note that one of the entries has a different event: \"Security Warning: User initiated a file download from an untrusted source.\" Wait, no, looking back, the user provided logs don't have that. Wait, no, in the given logs, the only other entry is \"Security Warning: User initiated a file download from an untrusted source.\" Wait, no, looking at the data again, the user's input shows entries like:\n\n{\"event\": \"File created\", \"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", ...} repeated multiple times, and then one entry with \"Security Warning: User initiated a file download from an untrusted source.\"\n\nWait, but in the actual data provided by the user, the entries are all \"File created\" events. Let me check again. The user's input is a series of JSON-like entries. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the input, each line is something like:\n\n{\"event\": \"File created\", \"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", \"file_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js\"}\n\nThen, the last entry is:\n\n{\"event\": \"Security Warning: User initiated a file download from an untrusted source.\", \"process\": \"explorer.exe\", \"file_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\...\\\\Downloads\\\\suspicious_file.exe\"}\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's input again, the last entry is:\n\n{\"event\": \"File created\", \"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", \"file_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js\"}\n\nWait, no, the user's input doesn't include that last entry. Let me recheck the exact data provided.\n\nThe user's input ends with:\n\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\Resources\\\\Office\\\\16.0\\\\Root\\\\...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js\"}}\n\nWait, no, the user's input is a list of entries, all with \"File created\" events, and the only other entry is the one with \"Security Warning: User initiated a file download from an untrusted source.\" But looking at the data provided, the user's input does not include that. Wait, the user's input is:\n\nLooking at the data again, the user pasted a series of lines, each starting with:\n\n{\"event\": \"File created\", \"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", ...}\n\nand the last line is:\n\n{\"process\":{\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\Resources\\\\Office\\\\16.0\\\\Root\\\\...\\\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js\"}}\n\nSo, all entries are \"File created\" events. There's no mention of a security warning in the user's input. Wait, maybe I misread earlier. Let me check again.\n\nNo, the user's input does not have a security warning entry. All entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. So, the main issue here is the repeated creation of these files by SDXHelper.exe.\n\nNow, considering that, the next step is to determine if this is normal. SDXHelper.exe – if it's a legitimate process, perhaps part of a software that needs to create temporary files or resources. However, the large number of files being created might be unusual. Also, the naming pattern with hashes suggests that they might be generated dynamically, which could be part of a legitimate process (like generating unique resources) or part of malware generating a lot of files to evade detection.\n\nAnother angle: the file paths. They are in the Office directory, which might be a red flag if the process is not related to Office. However, if SDXHelper.exe is part of an Office add-in or something, then it's possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the process is creating so many files in a short period might be a sign of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IOCs), the repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory, along with the naming conventions, might be suspicious. The user might need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. They could check the process's digital signature, its location on the disk, and its behavior.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the user has installed any software recently that might be associated with SDXHelper.exe. If not, that's a red flag.\n\nIn conclusion, while the process might be legitimate, the behavior of creating numerous files in a system directory, especially with hash-based names, is suspicious. The user should investigate further by checking the process's details, looking for any known malware associated with SDXHelper.exe, and monitoring for other suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe repeated creation of files by **SDXHelper.exe** in the **Microsoft Office** directory, particularly with names like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, raises several red flags. Here's a structured analysis and recommended next steps:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Name: SDXHelper.exe**\n   - **Uncommon**: This is not a widely recognized system or third-party process. While it may be part of a legitimate application, it is not a standard Microsoft or well-known software component.\n   - **Location**: If the executable is not in a standard directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`), it could indicate a potential malicious file.\n\n2. **File Behavior**\n   - **High Volume of Files**: Creating numerous files in a short period is unusual for legitimate processes. This could be a tactic to evade detection or flood the system with temporary files.\n   - **Hashed Filenames**: The use of hash-based names (e.g., `min_<hash>.js`) suggests dynamically generated files, which is common in malware to avoid detection by signature-based scanners.\n\n3. **Location of Files**\n   - **Office Resources Directory**: While `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Resources` is a legitimate location for temporary files, the volume and nature of files created here are suspicious if not tied to a known application.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n- **Unusual Process Behavior**: SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office directory without clear user interaction.\n- **File Naming Patterns**: Files like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` may be part of a malicious payload or data exfiltration.\n- **Lack of Digital Signature**: If SDXHelper.exe is not digitally signed or signed by an untrusted entity, it increases the likelihood of being malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**\n   - **Check File Location**: Ensure the executable is in a trusted directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files` or a known application folder).\n   - **Digital Signature**: Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to check if the file is signed by a trusted publisher.\n   - **Online Reputation Check**: Use VirusTotal to analyze the file's hash and check for malware reports.\n\n2. **Monitor System Behavior**\n   - **Network Activity**: Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Microsoft Defender Network Monitor** to check if the process is communicating with suspicious IP addresses or domains.\n   - **Disk Usage**: Monitor for unusual disk I\/O spikes or large file creation events.\n\n3. **Check for Known Malware**\n   - Search for **SDXHelper.exe** in malware databases (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to see if it is associated with known malicious activity.\n\n4. **System Scans**\n   - Run a full system scan using **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to detect any hidden threats.\n\n5. **User Behavior Analysis**\n   - Determine if the user recently installed software or clicked on suspicious links, which could correlate with the appearance of SDXHelper.exe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the behavior of **SDXHelper.exe** could theoretically be legitimate (e.g., part of a niche application), the combination of:\n- Unusual file creation patterns,\n- Hash-based filenames,\n- Lack of clear association with known software,\n\nStrongly suggests a potential security threat. Immediate investigation and scanning are recommended to rule out malware or unauthorized activity. If the process is confirmed malicious, remove it and take steps to secure the system (e.g., update software, patch vulnerabilities)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's PackageResources.

I know that some legitimate software uses helper processes, but sometimes malware disguises itself as such. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the fact that so many files are being created in a short period might be suspicious.\n\nNext, the file names. They all seem to be minified JavaScript files, given the \".min\" extension. The term \"officeaicopilot\" could be a part of a legitimate application, maybe related to Microsoft Office or some add-on. But the repetition of file creation might indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, which could be a sign of malicious activity, like data exfiltration or creating a backdoor.\n\nHowever, another angle: sometimes during software updates or installations, multiple files are created. But if this is happening repeatedly or in a non-standard location, that's a red flag. The path mentioned is under \"PackageResources,\" which might be a standard location for some applications, but again, the volume here is high.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known malicious activities related to SDXHelper.exe.

This could be benign if it's part of a legitimate process, but the lack of variation in the file names and the high number of creations might suggest something's wrong. Alternatively, it could be a false positive if the software is legitimately generating these files as part of its normal operations.\n\nIn the absence of more information, the safest bet is to flag this as suspicious. The user should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, verify its digital signature, and ensure it's not part of any unexpected software installation. If it's not recognized, further investigation or using antivirus tools would be advisable.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show repeated activity from the `SDXHelper.exe` process creating multiple `.min` files (likely JavaScript files) in the `PackageResources` directory under Microsoft Office's installation path. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Involvement**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is the sole process involved in all file-creation events. This process is not a standard Microsoft Office component, and its legitimacy depends on context (e.g., third-party software, updates, or malware).\n\n2. **File Patterns**:\n   - All files share a naming convention: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`, suggesting they may be minified code or configuration files.\n   - The repetitive creation of files with unique hashes could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate activity** (e.g., dynamic resource generation during an update or application runtime).\n     - **Malicious behavior** (e.g., data exfiltration, payload delivery, or persistence mechanisms).\n\n3. **Directory Location**:\n   - The `PackageResources` folder is typically used by applications for storing assets or configurations. However, the volume of files created here is unusually high and repetitive, which may be atypical for standard operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Concern**\n- **Lack of Variability**: The same process repeatedly creating files with similar names may suggest automation or scripted behavior, which could be benign (e.g., a legitimate tool) or malicious (e.g., malware generating files to avoid detection).\n- **Unusual File Count**: Multiple files with unique hashes in a short timeframe may indicate data generation, logging, or exfiltration.\n- **Unknown Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a well-known Microsoft component. If it is not associated with any installed software, this raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (use tools like `sigcheck` or the Properties dialog in Windows).\n   - Confirm if the process is part of a known application (e.g., check the installation directory or associated software).\n\n2. **Monitor Behavior**:\n   - Use **process monitoring tools** (e.g., Process Explorer, Sysinternals Suite) to observe if `SDXHelper.exe` interacts with other processes, accesses sensitive files, or communicates over the network.\n\n3. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a **full system scan** with updated antivirus\/antimalware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - Submit the file to malware analysis platforms (e.g., VirusTotal) for further inspection.\n\n4. **Review System Changes**:\n   - Check the **Windows Event Viewer** for related logs (e.g., application, security, or system events) around the time of the file creations.\n   - Look for **recent software installations** or updates that might have introduced the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could be benign (e.g., part of a legitimate software update or tool), the repetitive creation of files by an obscure process (`SDXHelper.exe`) in a non-standard context warrants further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation. The answer needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the logs. Most of them are about files being created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" in the directory \"C:\\Users\\...\\Office\\...\\OfflineFiles\\...\". The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash-like string. The other entries are from \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values, but those are fewer and might be normal activity.\n\nNow, \"SDXHelper.exe\" – I'm not sure what that is. Maybe it's part of some software, but if it's creating a lot of files in the OfflineFiles folder, that might be unusual. Typically, the Offline Files feature in Windows is used for caching network files, but creating multiple files with similar names could indicate something like malware dropping files or a legitimate application doing a lot of temporary file creation. However, the repetition of the same filenames with different hashes might be a red flag. It could be that the same process is repeatedly creating files, which could be part of a malicious activity, like downloading or executing payloads.\n\nAnother point is that all these files are in the same directory, which might be a sign of a specific operation. The fact that there are multiple entries for each file creation, even with the same filename and path, might indicate that the process is being called multiple times, which might not be normal. Also, the hashes in the filenames are unique, which could suggest that each file is different, but if they are all being created by the same process, that might be suspicious.\n\nHowever, I should consider that \"SDXHelper.exe\" could be a legitimate component. Maybe it's part of an application that uses the Offline Files feature extensively. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The key here is that there's a large number of file creations by this process in a specific location. If this is part of normal operations, there might be a pattern or a known process. But since I don't have that information, the high volume and the specific naming could be indicative of something malicious.\n\nThe presence of Chrome setting registry values might be unrelated, but it's worth noting that if there's a combination of different processes acting suspiciously, that could be a sign of a larger issue. However, the main focus here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the logs show a high number of file creations by a process that might not be known or might be acting in an unusual way. This could be a legitimate activity, but given the lack of context and the repetitive nature, it's more likely to be something worth investigating. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence level because there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further examination but not enough to confirm it as malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"justification\": \"The logs show repeated file creation by 'SDXHelper.exe' in the 'OfflineFiles' directory with filenames containing unique hash-like strings (e.g., 'officeaicopilot-strings.min_5a5d966fb4bee84e88c268af3293257d.js'). This pattern may indicate unusual activity, such as data exfiltration, payload storage, or malicious behavior. The repetition of similar file operations could suggest a script or process generating multiple files, which is atypical for standard system operations. While 'chrome.exe' registry activity is common, the focus on 'SDXHelper.exe' raises suspicion.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the same directory under the Microsoft Office folder. Each entry has a different filename, but the structure of the path is the same. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that sometimes legitimate software uses similar names, but sometimes malware does too. The fact that it's creating a lot of files with different hashes (the long strings after \"min_\") might be a red flag. If it's a legitimate process, maybe it's part of some update or installation, but creating so many files in a short period could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all end with \".min.js\", which is common for minified JavaScript files. That makes me think maybe it's related to some web application or Office add-in. But why so many? If it's part of a legitimate update, maybe there are multiple files being downloaded or generated. However, the repetition of the same process creating these files without any other context (like a user initiating an action) could be concerning.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory path. The files are being created in the \"OfflineFiles\" folder under \"PackageResources\" within the Office installation directory. That's a specific location. I should check if that's a known directory for legitimate activities. If Office is using that folder for caching or temporary files, maybe this is normal. But if there's no prior knowledge of such activity, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, the timestamps of these events—if they're all clustered closely together, that might indicate a sudden burst of activity, which could be malicious. However, without knowing the exact timeline, it's hard to tell. The repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be part of a larger attack, like downloading components of malware or setting up a persistent presence.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of these files being benign. For example, if a user is installing a new application or updating Office, these could be temporary files. But the lack of user context here is a problem. If this is from a system log without user interaction, that's more suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: checking if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind—Microsoft doesn't have an official SDXHelper.exe, but third-party software might use that name. Alternatively, it could be a typo or a renamed malicious file. If the process isn't signed or if it's located in an unusual directory (not the system32 folder), that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that all the files are JavaScript minified files might be part of a web-based attack, trying to inject malicious code. But again, without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, the sheer number of files created by the same process without clear purpose is suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while there's a possibility that this is legitimate activity (like an update), the repetitive creation of multiple files by a single process in a specific directory, along with the nature of the files, raises concerns. It's probably worth investigating further, checking the process's origin, verifying its legitimacy, and scanning the files for malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is creating numerous minified JavaScript files (`.min.js`) in the **Microsoft Office** directory under `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is generating multiple files with unique hashes (e.g., `min_6d5a1a2afce2bb6422b189d37432ea56.js`) in a short period.\n   - All files follow the same naming pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`.\n\n2. **File Location**:\n   - Files are created in a subdirectory of the **Microsoft Office installation path** (`C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\...`), specifically under `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n\n3. **File Type**:\n   - The `.min.js` extension is common for **minified JavaScript**, often used in web applications or add-ins. However, the repetitive generation of such files by a single process is unusual.\n\n4. **Process Identity**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Microsoft process. It may be a third-party application, a renamed malicious file, or part of a legitimate software update (though this is unlikely without user context).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - The creation of multiple files with unique hashes could indicate **malware downloading components** or **generating payloads**.\n  - The use of `OfflineFiles` (a directory typically used for caching or temporary storage) might be exploited for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Legitimacy Questions**:\n  - If **SDXHelper.exe** is part of a legitimate software update, the files might be temporary resources. However, **no user interaction or installation context** is mentioned, which raises suspicion.\n\n- **Security Risks**:\n  - The `.min.js` files could contain **malicious scripts** if the process is compromised. Minification can obscure malicious code, making detection harder.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check the **file signature** and **digital certificate** of `SDXHelper.exe` (if it exists in the system).\n   - Confirm its **origin** (e.g., installed software, third-party application).\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Use **antivirus\/malware scanners** to analyze the files and process.\n   - Submit the files to **online malware analysis platforms** (e.g., VirusTotal).\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Check for **unusual network activity** (e.g., outgoing connections to suspicious IPs).\n   - Monitor **system performance** for signs of resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Investigate Context**:\n   - Determine if the files were created during a **software update**, **user action**, or **system event**.\n   - Check **Windows Event Logs** for related errors or warnings.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could theoretically be part of a legitimate process (e.g., a third-party Office add-in), the **repetitive creation of minified JavaScript files** by **SDXHelper.exe** in a Microsoft Office directory is **highly suspicious**. This behavior aligns with **malicious activity**, such as **malware persistence** or **data exfiltration**. Further investigation is strongly recommended. \n\n**Action Required**: Isolate the affected system, scan for malware, and verify the legitimacy of the process and files."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office application data directory. The files are all named similarly, with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that sometimes legitimate processes can have names that are similar to malware, but it's also possible that this is a malicious process. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that it's creating a lot of JavaScript files in the Office directory might be suspicious. \n\nNow, looking at the file names, they all have the same base name but different hashes. That makes me think that these files might be generated dynamically, perhaps as part of some kind of obfuscation or to avoid detection. The use of .min.js suggests they could be minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications but less so in local applications like Office. \n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of the same process and the same directory structure. If this is a legitimate process, why would it be creating so many files? Maybe it's part of an update or some kind of data collection, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, it could be part of a malicious payload, where each file is a component of the malware, or perhaps they're being used to store data or execute code.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these files are part of a legitimate application. For example, some applications generate temporary files or cache data. However, the presence of so many files with similar names and the use of JavaScript might still be a red flag. \n\nAnother angle is to check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. If I recall, SDXHelper might be related to some software, but I'm not entirely sure. If it's not a known legitimate process, that's a concern. However, since I can't look that up right now, I have to rely on other clues.\n\nThe fact that all the files are created by the same process and in the same directory might indicate that this is part of a larger attack. The use of JavaScript files could be an attempt to execute code in a different context, or maybe they're being used to communicate with a remote server. \n\nAdditionally, the naming convention with the hash might be an attempt to make the files unique and harder to detect, which is a common tactic in malware. \n\nConsidering all these points, the suspicious activity here is the creation of multiple JavaScript files by a process that might not be legitimate, the use of minified files, and the potential for these files to be part of a malicious payload. Even though there's no direct evidence of malicious activity in these events, the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a potentially suspicious pattern of activity involving the `SDXHelper.exe` process, which repeatedly creates JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the Microsoft Office application data directory. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (unknown legitimacy, not a standard Microsoft process).\n   - **Action:** Creates multiple JavaScript files with a consistent naming pattern but unique hashes (e.g., `7bbcea0e29cbd6a23375d3e16b983098.js`).\n   - **Location:** `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`.\n\n2. **File Characteristics:**\n   - **Names:** Suggest minified JavaScript files (`min_` prefix), commonly used in web applications but less typical for local applications like Office.\n   - **Hashes:** Unique per file, possibly indicating dynamically generated content (e.g., obfuscation, payload delivery, or evasion).\n\n3. **Contextual Red Flags:**\n   - **Unusual Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft Office process. Legitimate Office processes typically do not generate minified JS files in this directory.\n   - **Potential Malicious Behavior:** \n     - **Persistence:** Repeated file creation may indicate persistence mechanisms (e.g., caching, data exfiltration).\n     - **Obfuscation:** Use of hashes and minified code could hide malicious payloads or evade detection.\n     - **Lateral Movement:** JavaScript files might be used to execute scripts or communicate with remote servers.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likely Malicious:** The behavior aligns with tactics used by malware (e.g., droppers, loaders, or data exfiltrators). The lack of a clear legitimate purpose for these files in the Office directory raises concerns.\n- **Potential Impact:** Could be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., phishing, ransomware, or spyware).\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check the file path, digital signature, and parent process using tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes**.\n   - Search for the process in Microsoft's official documentation or threat intelligence databases (e.g., VirusTotal).\n\n2. **Analyze the Files:**\n   - Decompile\/minify the JavaScript files (if possible) to inspect for malicious code.\n   - Use sandboxing tools to observe behavior when executing the files.\n\n3. **System Scanning:**\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/malware removal tools.\n   - Check for other anomalous processes or network activity.\n\n4. **Network Monitoring:**\n   - Monitor for unusual outbound connections (e.g., to C2 servers) from the affected system.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity described is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The creation of minified JavaScript files by an unknown process in a sensitive directory is a strong indicator of potential malware. Further analysis is required to confirm the threat and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this. The user provided a list of file creation events, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, in the same directory under Microsoft Office Solution Packages. The files are named with a pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a unique hash-like string and .js extension. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if these are legitimate files or if they might be malicious. The naming suggests they are part of some localization or string resources, given the \"strings\" in the name and the \".min\" which often stands for minified JavaScript. However, the presence of so many files with different hashes might be suspicious.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Microsoft Office typically doesn't have a process named SDXHelper.exe. Maybe it's related to some third-party software or an add-in. Alternatively, it could be a malicious process masquerading as a helper. \n\nNext, looking at the file paths. The files are in the \"Solution Packages\" directory, which might be part of an Office add-in or template. However, the number of files (over 20) seems excessive for typical string resources. Legitimate software usually doesn't generate that many minified JS files with unique hashes in a single directory.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same file names with different hashes. Each entry is a separate file, but they all seem to be variations of the same base name. This could indicate that the process is generating or copying these files, which might be part of a larger operation like data exfiltration or creating a backdoor.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate tool used for some specific purpose, but the sheer number of files and the naming pattern are red flags. It's also possible that these files are part of a software update or installation process, but again, the volume seems high.\n\nTo confirm, checking online databases like VirusTotal or Microsoft's own threat intelligence could help identify if SDXHelper.exe is associated with any known malware. Additionally, looking at the hash values of these files might reveal if they match any known malicious hashes.\n\nIn summary, while the files could be part of a legitimate process, the combination of the unusual process name, the number of files, and the naming pattern suggests a potential security threat. The user should investigate further by scanning the files with antivirus software and checking the process's origin and behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a series of file creation events in the `Microsoft Office` directory, all generated by the process **SDXHelper.exe**. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **File Pattern**:\n   - All files follow the naming convention:  \n     `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`  \n     (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_8ebfe07f2f3572ae1923f187f9f5ac20.js`).\n   - **\"min\"** suggests minified JavaScript (common in web apps\/localization).\n   - **Hashes** in filenames are unique, implying potentially dynamic or generated content.\n\n2. **Process**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a known Microsoft Office process. It may be:\n     - A third-party tool (e.g., an Office add-in, plugin, or localization utility).\n     - A **malicious process** (e.g., a dropper, backdoor, or data exfiltration tool).\n\n3. **Quantity**:\n   - Over **20 files** created in the same directory. This volume is unusual for legitimate localization files, which typically have fewer entries.\n\n4. **Directory**:\n   - Files are stored in the `Solution Packages` folder, which may be part of an Office add-in or template. However, the sheer number of files here is atypical.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - The process **SDXHelper.exe** could be **malware** (e.g., a downloader, cryptominer, or persistence mechanism).\n  - The files might be **payloads**, **logs**, or **data** being written to disk (e.g., exfiltration).\n  - The use of unique hashes may indicate **obfuscation** or **dynamic generation** of malicious content.\n\n- **False Positive**:\n  - **SDXHelper.exe** could be a **legitimate tool** (e.g., a localization or packaging utility), but the volume and naming pattern are suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Process**:\n   - **Check the process origin**:\n     - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to inspect the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe`.\n     - Confirm if it’s a known legitimate tool or part of a trusted software suite.\n   - **Search online** for `SDXHelper.exe` to see if it’s associated with malware (e.g., via VirusTotal, Microsoft Defender, or threat intelligence platforms).\n\n2. **Analyze the Files**:\n   - **Scan the files** with antivirus\/malware scanners (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, or VirusTotal).\n   - **Inspect the contents** of the `.js` files (if safe to do so) for suspicious code (e.g., obfuscation, external API calls, or data exfiltration patterns).\n\n3. **Monitor Behavior**:\n   - Use **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to monitor `SDXHelper.exe` for:\n     - Network connections (e.g., to C2 servers).\n     - File modifications or deletions.\n     - Registry changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Isolate and Remove**:\n   - If the process is confirmed malicious, **terminate it** and **delete the generated files**.\n   - Perform a **full system scan** to remove any related malware.\n\n5. **Check for Office Add-ins**:\n   - If the files are part of a legitimate Office add-in, ensure it’s from a trusted source and update it to the latest version.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **unusual process name**, **high volume of files**, and **obfuscated filenames** suggests a **potential security threat**. Immediate investigation is recommended to rule out malware or malicious activity. If unsure, consult a cybersecurity professional or use automated tools for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, all showing file creation events. The process involved is mostly SDXHelper.exe, except for one entry with chrome.exe. The files are all JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory, with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_... and some temporary files.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? It's used for some installation or update processes. The fact that there are so many file creations under the Office directory might be normal during an update. But wait, why are there so many entries? Like, each file is being created multiple times. For example, the min_a582bcf0...js is created twice. Maybe that's just the same file being written multiple times, or maybe different versions?\n\nBut then there's the chrome.exe entry creating a temporary file in the Downloads folder. That seems more like a normal temporary file creation, maybe from a download. But why is that in the logs? Unless there's a malicious activity here, but I don't see any red flags. The file names don't look suspicious, and the paths are standard.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this is a security threat. Let me think. If SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of JavaScript files in the Office directory, could that be part of a legitimate update? Microsoft does distribute updates that might involve creating temporary files. However, the repetition of the same files might be a sign of something else. Maybe a loop or an error in the update process.\n\nAlternatively, if the files are being created in a different location or have unusual names, that could be a concern. But here, the files are in the expected Office directory. The temporary file from chrome.exe is also normal. So maybe this is just a normal system activity. But I should check if there's any pattern indicating malicious behavior. For example, if the files were being created in a different directory, or if there were other processes involved, like notepad.exe or something else.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"min_\" in the file names suggests minified JavaScript, which is common for web applications. But in the context of Office, maybe it's part of some add-in or embedded web content. If the user is running Office 365, it's possible that these files are part of the online services or add-ins.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of entries might be a bit concerning. Maybe the system is trying to update but is stuck in a loop. Or perhaps there's a malware disguising itself as SDXHelper.exe. But without more information, like the hashes of the files or other logs indicating suspicious activity, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given logs, it's likely part of a legitimate update process by Microsoft Office. The chrome.exe entry is normal for a temporary file. However, if the user is experiencing unusual behavior or if this is part of a larger set of logs with other anomalies, further investigation would be needed. But from this data alone, it doesn't look like a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided appear to be **normal system activity** associated with **Microsoft Office updates or installations**, with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Process: `SDXHelper.exe`**\n- **Purpose**: `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of **Microsoft Office** (specifically, part of the **Setup and Deployment** tools). It is often involved in **installing updates, language packs, or add-ins**.\n- **File Creation**: The repeated creation of JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory suggests **language-specific resources** being deployed (e.g., for Office 365 or localized versions of Office). This is consistent with **Office updates or configuration changes**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temporary File from `chrome.exe`**\n- The single entry involving `chrome.exe` creating a `.tmp` file in the `Downloads` folder is **normal behavior** for browsers during downloads. Temporary files are typically created during file transfers and are deleted after completion.\n\n---\n\n### **3. No Red Flags**\n- **File Paths**: All file paths are standard and consistent with **legitimate Office operations**.\n- **File Names**: The use of `.min.js` (minified JavaScript) is common for web-based components (e.g., embedded add-ins or Office Online services).\n- **No Anomalies**: There is no evidence of:\n  - Unusual directories (e.g., `Temp`, `AppData\\Roaming`, or user-specific folders).\n  - Suspicious file extensions (e.g., `.exe`, `.dll`, `.bat`).\n  - High-frequency or repeated errors.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Concerns (if any)**\n- **Repetition of Files**: While the same `.js` files are created multiple times, this could indicate:\n  - A **redundant update process** (e.g., retrying a failed deployment).\n  - A **malware mimicking legitimate processes** (though no other indicators of compromise are present in the logs).\n- **Further Investigation**: If this is part of a larger set of logs or if the system exhibits unusual behavior (e.g., high CPU usage, unexpected network activity), deeper analysis (e.g., checking file hashes, monitoring processes) would be warranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**No immediate security threat** is indicated by the logs. The activity aligns with **normal Office update operations**. However, if the repetition of files or other anomalies persist, further investigation using tools like **Process Monitor** or **Windows Defender** is recommended."}

There are a bunch of entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a bunch of hexadecimal characters. The files are all in the same directory under Microsoft Office Packages.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses processes with similar names, but sometimes malware also uses such names. However, the key here is the pattern of file creation. The filenames have a common prefix and then unique hashes. That might indicate that these are part of a legitimate update or installation process, where each file is a different component or version. \n\nBut wait, the fact that there are so many files being created in the same directory could be a red flag. If this is part of a normal update, maybe the system would handle it more efficiently, but creating so many files with different hashes might be unusual. Alternatively, it could be part of a software deployment that's generating multiple resources.\n\nAnother angle: the term \"officeaicopilot\" might be a typo or a misrepresentation. Maybe it's related to \"Office AI Copilot,\" which is a feature in some Microsoft products. If that's the case, then these files could be part of an update for that feature. But I should check if there's any known legitimate activity related to this.\n\nHowever, the repetitive nature of the files and the use of min_ in the filename might suggest that these are minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. If SDXHelper is involved in deploying web components, this could be normal. But again, the number of files is high.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known malware that uses SDXHelper.exe. A quick check (even though I can't browse the internet) tells me that SDXHelper.exe is sometimes associated with malware, but it's also used by some legitimate applications. So context is important here.\n\nBut given that all the files are in the same directory and have similar naming, it might be part of a legitimate software update. However, the sheer number of files being created could be suspicious. Alternatively, it could be a benign process that's part of a software installation or update.\n\nWait, the user provided the logs and wants me to determine if it's malicious. Since I don't have access to real-time databases, I need to rely on analysis. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files with similar names in a specific directory could be a sign of a legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the presence of min_ files might be more common in web-related software, which is often part of Office updates.\n\nAlternatively, if this is part of a malware's file dropper technique, creating many files with unique hashes could be a way to avoid detection. But again, without more information, it's difficult to confirm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity could be part of a legitimate update process, the high number of files and the naming pattern might also be indicative of malicious activity. Further investigation, such as checking the process's digital signature, checking for any known malware associations, and analyzing the files' contents, would be necessary to determine the true nature of this activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs show repeated activity by the process **SDXHelper.exe** creating multiple files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` in the directory `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfficeSoftware`. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Files are named with a consistent prefix (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_`) followed by a unique hexadecimal hash (e.g., `min_b73ae912f742cfce138d4b727d540e8b.js`).\n   - This pattern is common in **minified JavaScript files**, often used in web applications or software updates.\n\n2. **Process Involvement**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate process associated with **Microsoft Office** (specifically, the \"Microsoft Office Software\" suite). It is used for tasks like component deployment and updates.\n\n3. **Directory Context**:\n   - The files are created in the Office installation directory (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`), which is typical for software updates or resource deployment.\n\n4. **Volume of Activity**:\n   - Over **20 files** are created, each with a unique hash. While this could indicate a **legitimate update** (e.g., deploying multiple resources for a feature like \"Office AI Copilot\"), it is also a **common tactic in malware** to evade detection by generating unique filenames.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n#### **Legitimate Scenario**:\n- **Office AI Copilot or Similar Feature**: The files may be part of a **Microsoft Office update** or new feature (e.g., AI-driven tools), where minified JavaScript files are deployed as part of the software.\n- **Software Deployment**: SDXHelper.exe is known to handle component installation, and the files could be resources for a new Office module.\n\n#### **Malicious Scenario**:\n- **Malware Dropper**: The process could be **compromised** (e.g., by malware) to generate and execute malicious payloads. The unique hashes might be used to avoid detection by antivirus tools.\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The files might be part of a **malware persistence strategy**, such as staging code for later execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be signed by Microsoft).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to confirm the process is associated with Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/malware removal tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - Use **VirusTotal** to analyze the files (if extracted) for malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Monitor Behavior**:\n   - Use **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals tools** to track if `SDXHelper.exe` is accessing unexpected locations or executing additional files.\n\n4. **Check for Office Updates**:\n   - Ensure Microsoft Office is up to date. If the files are part of a legitimate update, they may be temporary and cleaned up later.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity **could be legitimate** (e.g., a Microsoft Office update) or **malicious** (e.g., a compromised process). Without further context (e.g., file contents, system behavior), it is **not definitively malicious**, but the repetitive creation of unique files in a sensitive directory warrants **further investigation**.\n\n**Action**: If the system is not part of a corporate environment and no recent Office updates were installed, consider scanning for malware and verifying the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of a legitimate Office package, given the path and the naming convention. However, the same process is creating multiple instances of these files, which might be normal if they're part of an update or installation. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe sets a registry value. That's a normal activity, but I need to see if it's related to anything else. Another event shows chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. Urlmon.dll is a standard Windows DLL used for URL monikers, and MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. These are legitimate, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nBut wait, the main thing here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. The path is under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages, which is a known location for Office add-ins or updates. However, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, this might be normal. But if it's a malicious process, creating these files could be part of a malware distribution. However, the filenames are JavaScript files, which are common in legitimate scenarios as well.\n\nI should check if there are any other signs of compromise. The other events don't show any obvious malicious activity. No unusual network connections, no unexpected process executions, just the file creations and registry changes. But the repetition of the same file being created multiple times might be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process, but the repetition could indicate something like a loop or an attempt to overwrite files.\n\nAnother angle: SDXHelper.exe isn't a commonly known process. If it's not part of the user's installed software, that could be a problem. But without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of the files in the Office directory might be part of a legitimate update, but if the user hasn't initiated any such activity, that could be suspicious.\n\nHowever, the logs don't show any clear indicators of compromise. The events are all within normal system operations. The registry change by chrome.exe is normal, and the DLL loads are legitimate. The file creations, while repetitive, are in a directory that's used by Office, so they might be part of a legitimate process.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the batch isn't necessarily interesting for investigation unless there's additional context that SDXHelper.exe is known to be malicious. Based solely on the provided logs, the activities seem to be within normal system behavior, even if a bit repetitive. Therefore, the answer would be that it's not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events by **SDXHelper.exe** in the `Microsoft Office` directory, along with standard system activities (e.g., registry changes by `chrome.exe` and legitimate DLL loads). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creations:**\n   - **Location:** Files are created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, a legitimate directory for Office add-ins or updates.\n   - **File Types:** JavaScript files (`.js`) with names like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js` suggest they may be part of a **legitimate Office package** (e.g., localization files or scripts).\n   - **Repetition:** The same files are created multiple times, which could indicate:\n     - **Normal behavior** (e.g., retries during installation or updates).\n     - **Potential anomalies** (e.g., overwriting files, but no errors or unexpected outcomes are noted).\n\n2. **Other Events:**\n   - **Chrome.exe activity:** Registry value changes and loading of standard DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are **benign** and align with typical system operations.\n   - **No signs of compromise:** No suspicious network activity, unexpected process execution, or anomalous behavior is observed.\n\n### **Is This Interesting for Investigation?**\n- **Likely Not:** The events align with **normal system behavior**. The repetition of file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` is not inherently malicious, especially in the context of Office-related operations.\n- **Caution:** If `SDXHelper.exe` is **not a known legitimate process** on the system (e.g., not part of installed software or updates), further investigation would be warranted. However, based solely on the logs provided, there are **no clear indicators of compromise**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe batch of logs does **not appear to be interesting for investigation** unless additional context (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe` being untrusted or unexpected behavior outside these logs) is available.

Zone.Identifier is a known Windows feature used to mark files as coming from the internet, so that might be normal if the user downloaded the file. However, there are several instances of chrome.exe creating registry values, which could be benign if part of normal operation, but repeated registry changes might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe, which is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are officeaicopilot-strings.min with various hashes. The path is under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages, which is a bit suspicious. SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process; I know that Microsoft Office might have helper processes, but the name SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring a bell as a legitimate one. The fact that it's creating multiple files with similar names but different hashes could indicate some kind of payload or malicious activity. \n\nLooking at the first event, chrome.exe loaded a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. The path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. Wait, that's a legitimate Defender DLL. However, the event is about \"Image loaded,\" which is a normal part of process execution. But if the file is from a trusted location, maybe that's okay. However, if there's an unusual process loading a Defender DLL, that might be a sign of something else. But in this case, chrome.exe is the process, which might be normal if it's using Defender for some reason, though I'm not sure.\n\nThe repeated FileCreate events for SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office directory are concerning. Office's SolutionPackages are typically used for add-ins or solutions, but creating multiple JS files with minified names might be part of a malicious payload. Also, the fact that these files are being created under the OfflineFiles directory could be a way to persist or execute code. \n\nAnother point is the Zone.Identifier streams. Chrome creating those is normal when downloading files, as Windows adds that to mark the file as coming from the internet. But the multiple stream creations might be part of normal handling, though excessive could be a sign of something else.\n\nPutting this together, the most suspicious part is SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in a Microsoft Office directory. That's not typical behavior for a legitimate process. Additionally, the presence of multiple FileCreate events for similar files with different hashes might indicate that they're part of a larger payload or malicious activity. The chrome.exe events, while numerous, seem to be related to handling a downloaded file and normal registry operations, which might be acceptable. However, the combination of SDXHelper's activities and the chrome.exe's registry changes could suggest a potential security threat. I would flag this for further investigation, looking into the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe and the contents of those JavaScript files.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system event logs indicate a mix of normal user activity and potential suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Chrome.exe Activity**\n- **File Operations**: \n  - Chrome.exe is interacting with a downloaded Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) and its associated `Zone.Identifier` stream. This is **normal behavior** for Windows when handling downloaded files, as the `Zone.Identifier` marks the file as originating from the internet.\n  - Multiple `File stream created` events for the same file are likely due to Windows' handling of file metadata and are **benign**.\n\n- **DNS Query**: A `DnsQuery` event is logged, which is typical for Chrome during navigation or file downloads. No immediate concern here.\n\n- **Registry Changes**: \n  - Repeated `Registry value set` events by Chrome.exe could indicate **normal application behavior** (e.g., updating preferences or extensions). However, excessive or unusual registry modifications might warrant further scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **2. SDXHelper.exe Activity**\n- **File Creation in Office Directory**:\n  - **Path**: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`\n  - **Files Created**: Multiple JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min...js`) with unique hashes. \n  - **Suspicious Indicators**:\n    - **SDXHelper.exe** is **not a standard Microsoft process**. While Office may use helper processes, this name does not match known legitimate processes.\n    - The creation of **numerous minified JavaScript files** in the Office directory is **unusual** and could indicate:\n      - **Malicious payload delivery** (e.g., embedded scripts or add-ins).\n      - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., embedding malicious code in Office solutions).\n    - The use of a `SolutionPackages` directory (typically for Office add-ins) suggests **potential abuse of legitimate Office functionality** for malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk Assessment**\n- **Low Risk (Chrome.exe)**: The Chrome-related events align with normal user behavior (downloading files, DNS queries, registry updates).\n- **High Risk (SDXHelper.exe)**:\n  - The creation of multiple JavaScript files in a sensitive directory by an unknown process is **highly suspicious**.\n  - The files' names and hashes suggest **possible obfuscation or evasion techniques**, which are common in malware.\n  - **SDXHelper.exe** should be investigated further (e.g., checking its digital signature, process tree, and network activity).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommended Actions**\n1. **Investigate SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check if the process is signed by a legitimate publisher.\n   - Analyze its parent process and command-line arguments.\n   - Monitor network traffic and file system activity related to this process.\n\n2. **Inspect JavaScript Files**:\n   - Use a sandbox or static analysis tool to examine the contents of the `.js` files for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, payload delivery).\n\n3. **Review Office Add-ins**:\n   - Check if the user has recently installed or enabled any suspicious Office add-ins or solutions.\n\n4. **Log Analysis**:\n   - Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., process creation, network connections) to identify a potential attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the Chrome.exe activity appears legitimate, the **SDXHelper.exe-related events** are **highly suspicious** and warrant immediate investigation. The creation of multiple JavaScript files in the Office directory by an unknown process is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some Office add-in or package. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office, which is a common location for Office-related files. However, the filenames have hashes in them, which is a bit odd. Typically, legitimate files might have version numbers or dates, but hashes? That could be a red flag. Maybe someone is trying to obfuscate the filenames or use unique identifiers that aren't standard.\n\nThen there are a couple of events related to chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll and setting a registry value. Loading urlmon.dll isn't unusual, but combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger pattern. The registry event could be benign, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother event is about EXCEL.EXE opening a spreadsheet, which seems normal. The ImageLoad for combase.dll is also standard for Excel. But then there's another SDXHelper.exe creating a file in a different SolutionPackages directory with another hash in the filename. This repetition of SDXHelper creating files with hash-like names in different directories might indicate something malicious. \n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, but if it's creating a lot of files with strange names, that could be a sign of exploitation. Maybe a vulnerability in Office is being exploited, leading to the creation of these files. Alternatively, it could be part of a legitimate update or package installation, but the presence of multiple such events with different hashes might be suspicious.\n\nThe winlogbeat event is about creating a .yml.new file, which is part of the configuration process for winlogbeat. That seems normal. The chrome.exe events don't look particularly suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple SDXHelper.exe instances creating files with hash-based names in Office directories. This could be a sign of a malicious payload being injected or a legitimate process being abused. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the answer is probably yes. The unusual filenames and the repetition of file creation by SDXHelper in different package directories are indicators that warrant further examination. It's possible that this is part of a malware distribution or a zero-day exploit affecting Office. Without more context, it's hard to confirm, but the patterns here are suspicious enough to flag for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several events that warrant further investigation due to potential anomalies and suspicious patterns. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Pattern:** Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaic-xxxxx.js`) in subdirectories under `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`. The filenames include hash-like strings (e.g., `min_fed6f639486874dd9ba20993e56de4b2.js`), which is unusual for legitimate Office processes.\n   - **Context:** `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft Office process, but its role in creating files with obfuscated\/hashed names could indicate misuse (e.g., exploitation of a vulnerability or injection of malicious payloads).\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths:**\n   - The files are stored in `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`, a directory typically used for Office add-ins or packages. While not inherently malicious, the combination of hashed filenames and repetitive creation suggests potential tampering or unauthorized activity.\n\n3. **Other Processes:**\n   - **`chrome.exe`:** Loads `urlmon.dll` (a standard component for Internet Explorer\/Windows) and sets a registry value. These actions alone are benign but could be part of a broader pattern if correlated with other suspicious behavior.\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE`:** Opens a spreadsheet (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) and loads `combase.dll` (a core Windows component). No immediate red flags here.\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`:** Creates a `.yml.new` configuration file, which is a normal part of its operation.\n\n### **Suspicion Level:**\n- **High Risk Indicators:** \n  - The repetitive and obfuscated filenames generated by `SDXHelper.exe` are highly unusual and could indicate malicious activity (e.g., payload delivery, data exfiltration, or exploitation of a vulnerability in Office).\n  - The lack of clear context for the hashed filenames (e.g., no corresponding legitimate process or user action) raises concerns.\n\n- **Moderate Risk Indicators:**\n  - The presence of `RegistryEvent` and `ImageLoad` entries for standard components (e.g., `urlmon.dll`, `combase.dll`) is not inherently suspicious but could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check if the `.js` files created by `SDXHelper.exe` are associated with any network activity, user interactions, or other security events (e.g., unusual outbound connections, file modifications).\n\n2. **Analyze File Content:**\n   - Retrieve and inspect the contents of the suspicious `.js` files to determine if they contain malicious code (e.g., obfuscated scripts, payloads, or C2 communication).\n\n3. **Check for Exploits:**\n   - Investigate whether the Office-related files or processes are linked to known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs related to Office or `SDXHelper.exe`).\n\n4. **Monitor User Activity:**\n   - Determine if the files were created during user-initiated actions (e.g., opening a malicious document) or if they were generated autonomously.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs exhibit **suspicious behavior** that requires further investigation. The repetitive creation of obfuscated files by `SDXHelper.exe` is a strong indicator of potential exploitation or malicious activity. Immediate action, such as isolating affected systems, analyzing file contents, and checking for exploit signatures, is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit odd. Office usually doesn't generate JavaScript files in those folders, especially with names like \"word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js\". The long, random string in the filename might be a red flag. It could be a malicious file disguised as a legitimate one.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about EXCEL.EXE loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. Some of these are normal system DLLs, but loading a lot of them might be normal for Excel. However, the same DLLs being loaded multiple times could indicate something's up. Also, the Pipe Created event and Registry value sets by svchost.exe and EXCEL.EXE might be normal, but the repetition of Registry events by svchost.exe several times could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a file created and then immediately deleted: ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename typically indicate a temporary file or a hidden file, which might be part of normal Excel operations, but combined with other events, it could be part of an attack.\n\nAnother thing is the SDXHelper.exe creating another JavaScript file in a similar path. The repetition of file creation by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directories might be part of a larger pattern. Also, the HxTsr.exe process changing registry values. HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process, so that's a potential indicator of malware.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple suspicious file creations in unusual locations, repeated registry changes by non-standard processes, and the presence of HxTsr.exe. Even though some events are normal (like Excel loading DLLs), the combination of these factors raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities could be benign, but the overall pattern suggests a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in non-standard Office directories, EXCEL.EXE loading unusual DLLs, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and HxTsr.exe (non-standard process), and temporary file creation\/deletion patterns that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named things like am-et-ui-strings-json_...js. These look like language-specific UI string files. But why are they being created repeatedly? Also, the same file paths are repeated in the logs. That might be normal if it's part of an Office installation or update, but maybe not. \n\nThen there are entries related to EXCEL.EXE creating a file stream in a temporary directory, and loading some DLLs. The Zone.Identifier stream is common when files are downloaded from the internet, marking them as coming from a different zone (like the internet). But the main thing here is that Excel is creating a file and loading some system DLLs. The VBA DLL is part of Excel's functionality, so that might be normal.\n\nBut wait, the SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of these JSON files. SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, used for managing solutions and add-ins. So maybe this is part of a normal Office operation. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. If the system is repeatedly creating the same files, that could indicate a loop or a malicious process.\n\nAnother thing to check is the user context. Are these processes running under a normal user account or with elevated privileges? The logs don't specify, but if SDXHelper is running with admin rights, that might be suspicious. Also, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same file creation could be normal if it's part of an installation, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Zone.Identifier part in the Excel logs is normal for downloaded files. However, if the file 1680A406.xlsx is a malicious file, but there's no indication of that here. The logs just show the creation of the file and loading of standard DLLs.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of the events are related to normal Office operations. SDXHelper creating UI string files might be part of an Office update or installation. The Excel events are standard. However, the repetition of the same file creation events might be worth investigating further. But without additional indicators like unexpected network activity, unusual processes, or errors, it's hard to say it's malicious. \n\nBut the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. Since all these events are related to legitimate processes, maybe it's not. However, the repetition could be a sign of something wrong. Alternatively, it might just be a log that's capturing multiple instances of the same event. \n\nIn the absence of other suspicious activities, I think this is likely normal. But maybe the user should check if there are other logs or indicators that might suggest otherwise. So, the answer would be that it's not necessarily interesting, but the repetition could be worth a closer look if there are other anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries consist of a mix of **normal Office-related activities** and **potential red flags** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Normal Activities**\n- **SDXHelper.exe Creating UI String Files**:  \n  The repeated creation of files like `am-et-ui-strings-json_...js` in the `Microsoft.Office.SolutionPackages` directory is consistent with **Office installation\/update processes**. These files are typically language-specific UI strings used by Office add-ins or solutions. However, the **repetition of identical file creation events** (e.g., same file path and process) is **unusual** and could indicate:\n  - A **loop** in the installation\/update process.\n  - **Malicious activity** (e.g., a dropper or persistence mechanism) masquerading as legitimate Office operations.\n\n- **Excel.EXE Loading DLLs**:  \n  The loading of `coml2.dll` and `VBEUI.DLL` is **normal** for Excel. The `Zone.Identifier` stream is also standard for files downloaded from the internet (e.g., marking them as \"blocked\" for security).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potential Red Flags**\n- **Repetitive File Creation by SDXHelper.exe**:  \n  The **same files are logged multiple times** (e.g., `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json_...js` appears twice). While this could be a log redundancy, it might also indicate:\n  - A **malicious process** repeatedly generating files to avoid detection.\n  - A **corrupted Office installation** causing infinite loops.\n\n- **Lack of Contextual Clues**:  \n  The logs do not include:\n  - **User context** (e.g., admin vs. standard user).\n  - **Network activity** (e.g., downloads\/uploads).\n  - **Error codes or process anomalies** (e.g., high CPU\/memory usage).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk Assessment**\n- **Likely Benign**:  \n  If this is part of a **recent Office update or add-in deployment**, the activity could be normal. However, the **repetition** of identical events is **not typical** for legitimate processes.\n\n- **Potential Malicious Activity**:  \n  The **unusual file creation patterns** could indicate:\n  - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., malware hiding in Office-related processes).\n  - **Data exfiltration** (e.g., generating files to transfer data).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:  \n   Check for:\n   - **Network traffic** (e.g., unexpected outbound connections).\n   - **Process behavior** (e.g., unusual registry modifications, file deletions).\n   - **User activity** (e.g., admin privileges, unexpected logins).\n\n2. **Inspect the Files**:  \n   Verify the integrity of the generated files (e.g., using checksums or antivirus scans) to rule out **malware masquerading as legitimate Office files**.\n\n3. **Monitor SDXHelper.exe**:  \n   Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals** to trace the **file system and registry activity** of `SDXHelper.exe` and ensure it is not interacting with suspicious locations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs **do not confirm malicious activity**, the **repetitive file creation** by `SDXHelper.exe` is **unusual** and merits further investigation. If no other anomalies are present, it may be a **benign but redundant log entry**. However, **proactive monitoring** is advised to rule out potential threats. \n\n**Verdict**: **Low risk but requires closer inspection** of the repetitive file creation and correlation with other logs."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages folder. The same file paths are repeated, which might indicate some kind of package or update, but why so many duplicates?\n\nWait, the SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So maybe it's related to Office updates or add-ins. But creating so many .js files in the OfflineFiles directory could be part of a legitimate process. However, the repetition of the same files might be a red flag. Are these files being created multiple times unnecessarily?\n\nThen there's Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE modifying registry values. The registry changes could be normal, but if combined with the file creations, maybe there's something suspicious. However, EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder is typical for tracking recently opened files. The multiple registry events from EXCEL might be part of normal operations, like saving settings or handling documents.\n\nLooking at the confidence, the first event is a legitimate process, the SDXHelper ones are possibly normal but repetitive. The Explorer and Excel events don't show obvious malicious activity. However, the repetition of the same files being created by SDXHelper might suggest a potential issue, like a loop or a malicious payload. But without more context, like unusual processes or network activity, it's hard to say. Maybe the user is just installing something or updating Office. \n\nOverall, the logs don't show clear signs of malware, but the repetition might warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple SDXHelper.exe processes creating identical JavaScript files in Microsoft Office's OfflineFiles directory, which may indicate unusual behavior or potential tampering.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. So, there's a bunch of entries here. The first 27 events are all about Excel.exe modifying registry values. Then there are two entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nHmm. Excel normally doesn't modify the registry a lot, but maybe it's part of normal operations? However, 27 times is a lot. That might be suspicious. But then, the other part is the creation of these JS files. Office sometimes uses JavaScript for add-ins or solutions, but the paths mentioned are in the SolutionPackages folder. Wait, the file names have hashes in them, like f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2. That looks like a unique identifier, maybe for a specific package. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating these files? SDXHelper is related to Office solutions, so maybe it's part of a legitimate installation or update. But combined with the Excel registry changes, it's a bit odd.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is interesting. So, if all these events are part of a normal Office update or installation, then it's not interesting. But if the registry changes are unusual or the files created are malicious, then it's interesting. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or the content of the JS files, it's hard to tell. But the fact that there are multiple registry changes by Excel and the creation of files in a specific directory might be worth investigating. Maybe it's a sign of a malicious add-in or some kind of exploit. But I'm not sure. The confidence here might be moderate. Maybe 0.6?

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the logs, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they could be part of an add-in or some kind of package resources. Then there are also entries where \"EXCEL.EXE\" is performing DNS queries. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process off the top of my head. But Microsoft Office add-ins sometimes have helper processes. However, creating a lot of JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal if it's part of an add-in installation or update. But then again, if these files are being created in a user's local directory, maybe that's not standard. \n\nWait, the paths are all under %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That's a known location for Office add-ins. So maybe this is related to an add-in being installed or updated. But why so many files? The same file names are repeated, like transcription-strings.min.js and vendor.js. Could be that the add-in is being deployed, and these are the resources it's using. \n\nBut then there's the DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. That could be normal if the add-in is communicating with a server, but if there are a lot of them or to suspicious domains, that might be a red flag. However, the logs here don't mention the domains involved, just that DNS queries are happening. \n\nAnother point: the repetition of the same files being created multiple times. For example, the transcription-strings.min.js is created twice. Maybe that's part of a normal installation process, but it could also indicate some kind of loop or unexpected behavior. \n\nHowever, without more context, like the user's environment, whether this is a known add-in, or if there are other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. But considering that all the processes are related to Microsoft Office and the files are in expected directories, this might be a legitimate activity. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. So, maybe the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating so many files, and the repetition, could be something to look into. Especially if this is not a typical user action. For example, if the user didn't install any new add-ins, but these files are appearing, that could be a sign of malware. \n\nAlternatively, if this is part of a legitimate add-in deployment, then it's normal. But without knowing the context, the presence of multiple file creations and DNS queries might warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The events involve a helper process creating multiple JavaScript files in an Office add-in directory and Excel performing DNS queries. While this could be part of a legitimate add-in installation, the volume and repetition might be suspicious. Therefore, it's worth investigating to confirm if it's a legitimate process or if there's a security issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show activity involving the `SDXHelper.exe` process creating multiple JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office `SolutionPackages` directory, along with DNS queries initiated by `EXCEL.EXE`. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Location:** Files are created in `%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`, a known directory for Office add-ins and their resources.\n   - **File Types:** JavaScript files (`.js`) with names like `transcription-strings.min.js`, `vendor.js`, and locale-specific files (e.g., `cs-cz-ui-strings-json.js`). These resemble resources for an Office add-in or extension.\n   - **Repetition:** The same files are created multiple times (e.g., `transcription-strings.min.js` appears twice). This could indicate a deployment process, but repetition may also hint at unexpected behavior (e.g., a loop or redundant operations).\n\n2. **DNS Queries by `EXCEL.EXE`:**\n   - The presence of DNS queries from Excel could be normal if the add-in communicates with external servers. However, without context on the queried domains, this may warrant further scrutiny (e.g., checking for connections to suspicious or unknown domains).\n\n### **Legitimacy vs. Suspicion**\n- **Legitimate Scenario:**  \n  This activity could be part of a **legitimate Office add-in installation or update**, where `SDXHelper.exe` deploys resources and Excel communicates with a server for functionality. The `SolutionPackages` directory is a standard location for such operations.\n\n- **Suspicious Indicators:**  \n  - **Unusual Volume\/Repetition:** Multiple file creations and repeated entries might suggest **unauthorized deployment** or **malware activity** (e.g., droppers or loaders).  \n  - **Lack of User Context:** If the user did not initiate an add-in installation, this could indicate **unwanted software** or **compromise**.  \n  - **DNS Queries:** Without domain details, the queries could be benign (e.g., licensing checks) or malicious (e.g., exfiltration).\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Check Add-In Installation History:**  \n   - Verify if a new Office add-in was recently installed or updated.  \n   - Use tools like **Office Add-in Manager** or registry checks to identify associated add-ins.\n\n2. **Analyze DNS Queries:**  \n   - Use network monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark, Microsoft Defender ATP) to inspect the domains involved in the DNS queries.  \n   - Look for connections to known malicious domains or unexpected external servers.\n\n3. **File Integrity Checks:**  \n   - Use antivirus\/malware scanners to check the created files for threats.  \n   - Compare file hashes with known good hashes (e.g., via VirusTotal).\n\n4. **User Context:**  \n   - Confirm whether the user intentionally installed an add-in or if this activity is unexplained.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the activity could be legitimate (e.g., a new Office add-in deployment), the **repetition of file creation** and **lack of user context** warrant further investigation. If the files and DNS queries are unexplained or linked to suspicious domains, this may indicate **malware or unauthorized activity**. A thorough forensic analysis of the files, network traffic, and user context is recommended."}

Typically, Office might store resources in a different location. Also, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same file might indicate that the process is being repeated unnecessarily, which could be a sign of a malicious activity, like a dropper or something trying to install additional components.\n\nBut I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. I recall that some legitimate software uses similar names, but it's also possible that this is a malicious executable. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The key point here is the pattern of file creation. If this is part of a normal installation, there might be more variety in the file names and paths. But here, it's the same directory and similar naming conventions, which might be suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"OfflineFiles\" suggests that these might be part of an offline installation or update. However, the repetition could still be concerning. Also, the hash of the files isn't provided here, so I can't verify their integrity. \n\nConsidering all this, while it's possible that this is a legitimate process, the repetitive creation of similar files in a non-standard directory might indicate a potential security threat. Therefore, it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is creating multiple JavaScript (.js) files in the **Office SolutionPackages\/PackageResources\/OfflineFiles** directory. While some of these files may be legitimate (e.g., language-specific resources for Office), the pattern raises **potential security concerns**:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive File Creation**:\n   - The same files (e.g., `en-us-ui-strings-json_...js`) are logged multiple times, suggesting redundant or repeated operations. This could indicate:\n     - A **malicious dropper** attempting to deploy payloads.\n     - A **benign but inefficient process** (e.g., a failed update or redundant installation step).\n\n2. **Unusual Directory Structure**:\n   - The `OfflineFiles` subdirectory is not a standard location for Office resources. Legitimate Office updates typically use directories like `Updates` or `Resources`, not `OfflineFiles`.\n\n3. **Language-Specific Files**:\n   - The filenames include language codes (e.g., `es-es`, `en-gb`), which might be normal for localization. However, the **lack of variation** in the files (same filenames being created multiple times) is suspicious.\n\n4. **Process Legitimacy**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a well-known Microsoft process. While it could be part of a third-party application, its behavior here (repeated file creation in non-standard paths) warrants scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n- **Verify the Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n  - Check the file's digital signature and hash against known repositories (e.g., VirusTotal, Microsoft Defender).\n  - Confirm if the process is associated with a trusted application.\n\n- **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n  - Look for other suspicious activities (e.g., network connections, registry changes) by SDXHelper.exe.\n  - Check if the files created are actually used by Office or if they contain obfuscated code.\n\n- **Isolate and Analyze**:\n  - If the process is untrusted, isolate the system and analyze the files for malware indicators (e.g., packing, suspicious strings).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile the behavior could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., a third-party Office tool), the **repetitive creation of files in a non-standard directory** and the lack of transparency around **SDXHelper.exe** suggest **potential malicious activity**. Further investigation is required to confirm legitimacy. \n\n**Verdict**: **Suspicious – Further Analysis Required**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named things like et-ee-ui-strings-json with long hashes. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling add-ins or solutions. So creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal when installing or updating Office add-ins. The filenames seem to be language-specific UI strings, which makes sense for localization.\n\nBut wait, the same process is creating multiple files with different hashes. Are these all legitimate? Maybe the user is installing multiple add-ins, which would explain the repetition. However, the fact that all entries are from the same process and the same directory might be normal. \n\nAlternatively, could this be a sign of malware? Sometimes, malicious software uses legitimate-sounding names to hide their activities. But the process name is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known legitimate process. The files are in the expected directory, so that's a good sign. \n\nAnother thing to check is if there's any unusual activity. All the logs are about file creation, which is a common operation. There's no mention of deletion, modification, or access to other sensitive areas. The user hasn't mentioned any other suspicious logs, so this might be a false positive. \n\nHowever, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be worth investigating further. Maybe the user should check if these files are actually being used by Office or if they're leftovers from an incomplete installation. But based solely on the logs provided, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. \n\nIn conclusion, this seems like normal behavior for SDXHelper.exe when handling Office add-ins. Unless there are other signs of compromise, this might not be a security issue. But it's always good to verify the integrity of the files and ensure that the Office installation is up to date.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (a legitimate component of Microsoft Office) is creating files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. These files appear to be language-specific UI string resources (e.g., `et-ee-ui-strings-json`, `fr-fr-ui-strings-json`), which are typical for localization or add-in-related operations. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process and Location**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known, legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, often involved in managing add-ins or solutions.\n   - The **SolutionPackages** directory is a standard location for Office add-ins and localized resources.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Filenames like `xx-xx-ui-strings-json_<hash>` suggest localization files (e.g., `et-ee` for Estonian, `fr-fr` for French). The hash in the filename may represent a version or unique identifier for the resource.\n\n3. **No Suspicious Activity**:\n   - All entries involve **file creation**, not deletion, modification, or access to sensitive areas.\n   - No anomalies (e.g., unexpected processes, network activity, or errors) are present in the logs.\n\n### **Potential Explanations:**\n- **Office Add-In Installation\/Update**: The files may be part of a legitimate add-in or localization package being deployed.\n- **Localization Resources**: The files could be UI strings for different languages, which are commonly stored in such directories.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Verify File Integrity**: Ensure the files are not malicious by scanning them with antivirus software or checking their digital signatures.\n- **Check Office Logs**: Review additional Office or Windows logs for context (e.g., whether this activity correlates with an add-in installation).\n- **Monitor for Unusual Behavior**: If files are being created frequently or in unusual quantities, investigate further.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity appears **normal and legitimate** for a Microsoft Office environment. No immediate security concerns are evident based on the provided logs. However, always ensure that the Office suite is up to date and that no unauthorized add-ins are installed."}

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through the entries.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like \"fr-fr-ui-strings-json...\" and other language codes. These seem to be localization files, maybe part of an Office add-in or solution package. The process SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, so maybe it's just installing or updating some components. \n\nBut wait, there's one entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting logs, so that might be a user installing or configuring it. However, the rest are all from SDXHelper.exe. \n\nNow, considering security, if SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages folder, is that normal? It could be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses similar names. However, the filenames here are specific to localization, which seems benign. \n\nAnother point: all the files are .js files, which are common for scripts. But since they're in the Office directory, it's likely they're part of the Office application's resources. The repetition of the same process and directory might just be part of a package installation. \n\nBut why are there so many entries? Maybe the user is installing a multi-language package, leading to multiple files being created. Alternatively, if this is unexpected, it could be a red flag. However, without more context, like error messages or unexpected processes, it's hard to say. \n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe is normal if the user is setting up log collection. So, unless there's something else, like unusual network activity or other processes, these logs might just be part of normal operations. \n\nI think the key here is that all the events are from legitimate processes, and the files are in expected directories. Unless there's a known issue with SDXHelper.exe creating files in that location, this might not be suspicious. However, the sheer number of files could be worth checking if it's part of a larger attack, but based on the given info, I don't see clear malicious activity. \n\nSo, the answer would be that these logs are likely normal, but the user should verify if the SDXHelper.exe activity is expected. If there's no other suspicious behavior, it might not be interesting for investigation. But maybe the repetition is a sign of something, but without more data, it's hard to tell.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries are **likely benign** and part of normal system operations, but they warrant **limited scrutiny** based on the following analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process (`SDXHelper.exe`)**:\n   - The majority of events involve `SDXHelper.exe` creating `.js` files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. This process is associated with **Microsoft Office** and is often involved in **installing or updating language packs\/add-ins**. The filenames (e.g., `fr-fr-ui-strings-json`, `hi-in-ui-strings-json`) suggest **localization\/resource files** for different languages, which is typical for Office installations.\n\n2. **Normal File Creation**:\n   - The repeated creation of files by `SDXHelper.exe` in the `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` folder aligns with **Office's behavior during setup or updates**. This is not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **One Anomalous Entry**:\n   - A single event involves **`winlogbeat.exe`** (a log collection tool) creating a `.yml.new` file in the **`Downloads`** directory. This is **expected if the user is manually configuring Winlogbeat**, but it could also indicate **unauthorized log collection tools** if unexpected.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Volume of Activity**: The repeated creation of files by `SDXHelper.exe` might indicate **unusual behavior** if this is not part of a known Office update or installation. However, without additional context (e.g., network activity, unexpected processes), this is **not conclusive**.\n- **Lack of Malware Indicators**: No signs of malware (e.g., unusual file paths, unexpected processes, or non-standard filenames) are present in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Classification**: **Not immediately suspicious**, but **monitored**.\n- **Recommendation**:\n  - Verify if **Office updates or language packs** were recently installed.\n  - Check for **unauthorized log collection tools** (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe` in unexpected directories).\n  - If `SDXHelper.exe` is creating files **outside the Office directory** or in **non-standard locations**, further investigation is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Not Suspicious\",\n  \"risk_level\": \"Low\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The logs show legitimate activity related to Microsoft Office localization files and a single expected Winlogbeat configuration.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating various JavaScript files in different directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The first thing I notice is that there are a lot of repeated entries for the same files. For example, \"icon_built_in_svg_icon...\" is logged twice, same with \"icon_fluent_icon...\" and others. That repetition might be a clue.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not entirely sure what that is, but the name suggests it's related to some sort of helper process for a software, maybe a development tool or a service. The fact that it's creating these JS files in the Office SolutionPackages directory makes me think it could be part of an add-in or some customization for Office. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate a problem. Maybe the process is stuck in a loop, trying to create the same files over and over again. That could be a sign of a bug or a misconfiguration.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory structure. The files are placed in \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\", which might be a specific location for resources used by Office solutions. If these files are supposed to be generated once during deployment or setup, having them created repeatedly might not be normal. It could also be that the process is attempting to generate these files but is failing, leading to repeated attempts. Alternatively, maybe there's a script or a task that's supposed to run once but is being triggered multiple times, causing the duplicates.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of malware. Sometimes, malicious software uses legitimate-sounding process names to hide their activities. However, without more information, like the presence of other suspicious processes or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. The fact that all the files are JS files and are being created in a specific directory might not be enough to confirm malware, but it's something to consider.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be running a development environment or a tool that's generating these files as part of a build process. If that's the case, repeated creation could be due to a build configuration that's not set correctly, causing the process to regenerate files unnecessarily. However, the user hasn't mentioned any development activities, so that's speculative.\n\nIn terms of next steps, the user should check if there are any error messages or logs related to SDXHelper.exe that might explain why it's creating the same files repeatedly. Also, verifying the integrity of the files (like checking their hashes) could help determine if they're legitimate or if they've been tampered with. If this is part of a software deployment, reviewing the deployment scripts or configuration files for any loops or incorrect commands that might be causing the repetition would be important.\n\nOverall, the key points here are the repeated creation of the same files by a single process, which might indicate a loop, a bug, or potentially malicious activity. Further investigation into the process's behavior and the context in which these files are being created would be necessary to determine the exact cause.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is repeatedly creating multiple JavaScript files in specific subdirectories under **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages**. Here's a structured analysis and interpretation of the observations:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetition of File Creation**:\n   - The same files (e.g., `icon_built_in_svg_icon_...js`, `id-id-ui-strings-json_...js`) are logged multiple times, suggesting **duplicate creation attempts** by the process.\n   - This could indicate a **loop or misconfigured task** that repeatedly triggers the same file generation.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Files are named with language\/region codes (e.g., `hr-hr`, `id-id`, `is-is`) and resource types (e.g., `icon`, `ui-strings`). This suggests they may be **localized resource files** for an Office add-in, customization, or application.\n\n3. **Directory Structure**:\n   - Files are stored in `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`, a common location for **offline resources in Office solutions** (e.g., add-ins, embedded assets).\n\n4. **Process Context**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Windows process. It may be associated with **Microsoft Office tools**, **custom software**, or **third-party applications** (e.g., development environments, deployment tools).\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n1. **Legitimate Software Behavior**:\n   - If **SDXHelper.exe** is part of a **development or deployment tool** (e.g., Visual Studio, Office Add-in builder), the repeated file creation might be due to:\n     - A **build or deployment script** that is incorrectly configured (e.g., looping, missing termination conditions).\n     - A **cache or temporary file cleanup** process that is malfunctioning.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity**:\n   - While less likely without additional evidence, the repetition could indicate:\n     - **Malware** mimicking legitimate processes to generate files for persistence or data exfiltration.\n     - **Exploitation of a vulnerability** in Office or related tools to inject malicious resources.\n\n3. **Corruption or Misconfiguration**:\n   - A **corrupted Office installation** or **misconfigured add-in** might cause SDXHelper.exe to behave abnormally (e.g., infinite loops, duplicate generation).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check the **file path** of SDXHelper.exe (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\...` vs. `C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\...`).\n   - Use **Windows Defender** or **VirusTotal** to scan the executable for malware.\n\n2. **Check for Errors or Logs**:\n   - Look for **error messages** in the Event Viewer (under **Windows Logs > Application** or **System**) related to SDXHelper.exe.\n   - Review **Office logs** (e.g., `OfficeClickToRun logs` or `Add-in logs`) for clues about the process's purpose.\n\n3. **Investigate File Content**:\n   - Use a hex editor or script analysis tool to examine the generated JS files for:\n     - **Malicious code** (e.g., obfuscated scripts, network requests).\n     - **Duplicates** (e.g., identical content across multiple files).\n\n4. **Stop and Monitor the Process**:\n   - Temporarily **terminate SDXHelper.exe** via Task Manager to see if the behavior stops.\n   - Monitor for **reappearance** of the process or files using tools like **Process Explorer** or **File Monitor**.\n\n5. **Reinstall or Repair Office**:\n   - If the issue is tied to Office, run **Office Repair** via Control Panel or use the **Microsoft Office Troubleshooter**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe repeated creation of identical files by SDXHelper.exe is **unusual** and warrants further investigation. While it could be a **legitimate but misconfigured process**, the behavior also raises **red flags for potential malware**. Prioritize verifying the process's legitimacy and monitoring for suspicious activity. If no clear cause is found, consider **reinstalling affected software** or **seeking support** from the vendor of SDXHelper.exe."}

The files have names like \"it-it-ui-strings-json\" and other language codes. They all seem to be JavaScript files. Now, SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office, especially for handling add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple files with different language codes might be part of a legitimate installation or update. However, the repetition of some file names (like the ja-jp and ka-ge ones appearing twice) might be a red flag. Maybe it's a mistake in logging, but could also indicate some malicious activity if files are being created multiple times unnecessarily.\n\nThen there are events from EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes, and svchost.exe making registry modifications. svchost.exe is a normal system process, but excessive registry changes could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're benign or malicious. The DNS query from Excel might be part of normal operations, like looking up a domain for a link, but again, not sure.\n\nThe key point here is that the majority of events are from SDXHelper.exe creating files in a specific directory. If this is part of a legitimate Office add-in or update, it's normal. But if these files are being created in an unusual manner or if there are other signs of compromise (like unexpected network activity or registry changes), that could be a problem. However, the logs provided don't show any obvious malicious indicators beyond the repetitive file creation. Since SDXHelper.exe is associated with Office, and the files are in the SolutionPackages folder, which is used for add-ins, this might be a legitimate process. But the repetition might warrant further investigation to confirm. So, the answer is probably that it's not immediately suspicious but could be worth looking into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries predominantly involve **legitimate activities** associated with **Microsoft Office** and system processes, but there are **subtle indicators** that warrant closer scrutiny. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Activity:** Multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `xx-xx-ui-strings-json_...`) are created in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory by **SDXHelper.exe**.\n   - **Context:** SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft Office process involved in managing **add-ins** and **solution packages**. The filenames suggest **localization files** (language codes like `it-it`, `ko-kr`).\n   - **Red Flag:** **Repetition of identical file creation events** (e.g., `ja-jp` and `ka-ge` files appearing twice) could indicate **logging duplication** or **unusual behavior** (e.g., redundant file generation, potential tampering).\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE** and **svchost.exe** perform **registry modifications** and **DNS queries**. While these are normal for system processes, **excessive or unexplained registry changes** could hint at **malware persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup entries, hijacking system settings).\n\n3. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No **suspicious file paths**, **unusual network destinations**, or **high-risk process interactions** (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) are observed.\n   - The **file creation** aligns with **Office add-in deployment** workflows, which are **legitimate** in many contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of Legitimacy:** **High** (SDXHelper.exe and Office-related activity are expected in environments using Microsoft Office).\n- **Potential Concerns:** \n  - **Repetitive file creation** (e.g., duplicate entries) might indicate **logging errors** or **unusual behavior** (e.g., malicious payload staging).\n  - **Registry changes** (even if normal) could be **exploited** if tied to **unauthorized configuration modifications**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **additional suspicious activity** (e.g., unauthorized network traffic, process injections, or user account anomalies) around the same timeframe.\n   - Investigate **duplicate file creation events** to confirm if they are logging artifacts or indicative of **redundant operations**.\n\n2. **Verify File Integrity:**\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **SIEM** to scan the created files for **malware signatures** or **unusual code patterns** (e.g., obfuscation, embedded payloads).\n\n3. **Monitor Registry Changes:**\n   - Audit **registry modifications** by `EXCEL.EXE` and `svchost.exe` to ensure they align with known **Office or system updates**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not immediately malicious**, but the **repetitive file creation** and **registry activity** warrant **further investigation** to rule out **unusual behavior** or **potential compromise**.

The file path is in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which might be normal, but sometimes malicious files can be placed there. However, the rest of the events are all about EXCEL.EXE setting registry values. There are 32 instances of EXCEL.EXE modifying the registry.\n\nNow, Excel is a common application, and it's possible that legitimate activities involve registry changes. However, the sheer number of registry events from Excel could be a red flag. Malicious software might use registry modifications to persist or change configurations. But I need to check if there's any pattern here. All the registry events are from EXCEL.EXE, which is a legitimate process. However, if Excel is being used to modify registry keys that are not typical for Excel, that could be suspicious. \n\nWait, the first event's file is a JavaScript file in the OfflineFiles directory. That might be part of a package resource, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's related to an add-in or a template. However, the fact that there's only one file creation event and then a bunch of registry changes from Excel might not be directly connected. \n\nBut the problem is that the user is asking if the entire batch is interesting. The key here is that there's a single file creation by SDXHelper.exe, which is a less common process name, and then a large number of registry modifications by Excel. The repetition of the same event (registry value set) 32 times might indicate something automated or a loop. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn some cases, attackers use legitimate processes to perform malicious actions. If Excel is being exploited to modify registry keys, that could be a sign of a compromise. However, Excel normally doesn't modify the registry extensively. So, if there are many registry changes from Excel, that might be unusual. \n\nBut since the user wants a classification based on the entire batch, the presence of multiple registry events from Excel might be considered suspicious. However, the confidence level might be moderate because it's not certain. Alternatively, if the file created by SDXHelper.exe is benign, and the Excel events are normal, then it's not interesting. But without more info on the file's content, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering the high number of registry events from Excel, even if they are legitimate, it's unusual.

SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process; it's more commonly associated with malware or malicious activities. The files being created have names that look like language-specific UI strings, which might be part of a legitimate Office update or package, but the repetition and the specific paths might indicate something else.\n\nWait, the fact that there are multiple files being created in the same directory structure, with similar naming patterns, could suggest that this is part of a larger deployment or possibly a malicious payload. Also, the combination of registry changes and file creation by a non-standard process might indicate an attempt to modify system settings and install additional components.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known for any malicious activities.

Red Flags**\n- **Combination of Events**:  \n  - **Registry changes** (via Excel) paired with **file creation** (via SDXHelper) could indicate an attempt to **modify system behavior** (via registry) and **install payloads** (via files).  \n  - This pattern is common in **malware persistence mechanisms** (e.g., injecting code into Office processes or modifying registry keys for autorun).  \n- **Lack of Context**:  \n  - No logs indicate **user interaction** (e.g., manual installation of software).  \n  - No mention of **network activity** or **digital signatures** for `SDXHelper.exe`, which would be critical to validate legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommended Actions**\n- **Check for Malware**:  \n  - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/EDR tools.  \n  - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **SIEM** to trace `SDXHelper.exe`'s origin (e.g., parent process, file hash).  \n- **Validate File Integrity**:  \n  - Check the **hashes** of the created files against Microsoft's known good files.  \n  - Inspect the contents of `.js` files for obfuscation or malicious code (e.g., using `strings` or a deobfuscator).  \n- **Review User Activity**:  \n  - Determine if the user account executing these actions has **elevated privileges** or **unusual permissions**.  \n  - Check for **unauthorized software installations** or changes to Office configurations.  \n- **Monitor Network Traffic**:  \n  - Look for **outbound connections** from `SDXHelper.exe` to suspicious IPs or domains.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., Excel registry changes) may be legitimate, the **repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** in Office directories is highly suspicious. This behavior aligns with **malware deployment** or **unauthorized software installation**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or a **security incident**.  \n\n**Risk Level**: High (Potential malware activity).  \n**Next Steps**: Isolate the affected system, analyze file hashes, and investigate network\/registry anomalies."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files are named with language codes and .js extensions, like mi-mi-ui-strings-json_...js. That seems like localization files or some sort of UI strings for different languages. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with this process. Maybe it's part of a software that handles localization or some kind of add-in for Office? But I should check if this is a legitimate process. Wait, I don't recall Microsoft Office having a process named SDXHelper.exe. Maybe it's third-party software? Or could it be a typo or misnamed process?\n\nLooking at the file paths: they're all in the same structure, under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That seems like a place where Office might store add-ins or solutions. However, the fact that so many files are being created here by SDXHelper.exe might be unusual. Normally, Office add-ins are installed through specific channels, and creating numerous .js files in that directory could indicate something like a malicious payload, especially if it's generating files for many different language codes. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the files are named with language codes. That might be part of a legitimate localization process. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a short time could be suspicious. Also, there's only one entry where Excel (or another Office app) is involved, but that's just a single event. \n\nAnother thing to note is that there's a single event where the process is Excel, but the rest are all SDXHelper.exe. That might not be directly related, but the fact that SDXHelper is creating so many files in the SolutionPackages folder could be a red flag. \n\nI should also consider the possibility that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. Maybe it's part of a software development kit or a tool used for creating Office add-ins. However, the sheer number of files being created here might still be unusual. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that all the files are JavaScript files could be a sign of something like a malicious script being injected, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle: the timestamps. If all these events happened in a short period, that could be a sign of rapid file creation, which is often seen in malware activities. But since the logs don't include timestamps, I can't confirm that. \n\nIn summary, the key points are: repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe in a specific Office directory, the use of language codes in filenames which might be normal or abnormal, and the absence of SDXHelper.exe in known Microsoft processes. This seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the answer would be that this is interesting and needs to be looked into more.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting and warrants further investigation** due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Unusual Process Activity**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is creating **numerous JavaScript (.js) files** in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. This process is not a well-known Microsoft Office component, and its activity raises red flags, as legitimate Office processes typically do not generate such files in this location.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - The files are named with **language-specific codes** (e.g., `mi-mi-ui-strings-json_...js`, `ms-my-ui-strings-json_...js`). While this could theoretically relate to localization, the **repetition of filenames** and the **volume of files** (over 20 entries) suggest either:\n     - A **malicious payload** (e.g., injecting scripts for phishing, data exfiltration, or exploitation).\n     - A **misconfigured or rogue tool** generating excessive files.\n\n3. **Lack of Contextual Legitimacy**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not listed in Microsoft's official documentation as a legitimate Office process. Its presence here could indicate:\n     - A **third-party add-in** (if untrusted).\n     - **Malware** masquerading as a benign process.\n\n4. **Absence of User Interaction**:\n   - No evidence of user-initiated actions (e.g., installing software, opening files) is present. Automated or unauthorized file creation in sensitive directories is a strong indicator of compromise.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Investigate SDXHelper.exe**:\n  - Check its **digital signature**, **file hash**, and **origin** (e.g., via `Get-Process` in PowerShell or tools like `Process Explorer`).\n  - Monitor network activity for unusual outbound connections.\n- **Analyze the .js Files**:\n  - Inspect the contents for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, API calls to C2 servers).\n- **Check for Office Add-in Tampering**:\n  - Verify if any unauthorized add-ins are installed via `File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Add-ins`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity is **highly suspicious** and likely indicative of a **malicious process** or **compromised system**. Immediate forensic analysis and mitigation (e.g., isolating the system, removing the process) are recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided two log entries, both from the same process, SDXHelper.exe, and both are about creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that the same event is logged twice. That's a bit odd. Maybe a duplicate entry? But why would that happen?\n\nNext, looking at the file path. The file is in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, and the name is something like ne-np-ui-strings-json... with a long hash. That seems like a normal resource file, maybe part of an Office add-in or package. But the name includes a hash, which is common in legitimate files for versioning. However, sometimes malware uses similar naming conventions to blend in.\n\nThe process is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Solution Packaging tool. So that's a good sign. But if this process is creating files in the Office directories, that's expected. But why are there two identical logs?\n\nWait, maybe the file was created twice, but that's unusual. Or perhaps it's a log duplication error. However, the key here is that both events are the same. If there's no other suspicious activity, like unexpected network connections, privilege escalation, or other processes involved, then this might be a false positive. The file is in a legitimate location, and the process is known. The hash in the filename might be a red herring, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut the user is asking if this batch is interesting. Since both entries are the same, and there's no other malicious indicators, maybe it's not interesting. However, the repetition could be a sign of something. But without more data, like other events or anomalies, I can't be sure. The confidence here would be low because there's not enough evidence of malicious activity. The justification would be that the events are repetitive but involve a legitimate process and file path, so no clear threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Duplicate log entries show legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe (a known Microsoft Office process) in the expected Office SolutionPackages directory.
