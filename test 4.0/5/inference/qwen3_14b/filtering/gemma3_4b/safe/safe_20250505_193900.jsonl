The first entry is about ShellExperienceHost.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system file. Then there are several entries about svchost.exe and Explorer.EXE setting registry values. Chrome.exe is involved in multiple events: process creation, pipe creation, registry changes, DNS queries, and loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. There's also WmiPrvSE.exe loading wmiutils.dll, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation.\n\nMost of these events seem normal. Chrome doing DNS queries and network connections is typical. The registry changes might be part of normal operations or extensions. However, there's a lot of repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe. Could that be a sign of something? Maybe, but not necessarily malicious. The presence of legitimate processes and files doesn't indicate a clear attack. The only possibly suspicious thing is the high number of registry events, but without more context, it's hard to say. I think this is just normal user activity, so classification is NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show typical system and application behavior (e.g., Chrome browser operations, legitimate system processes, and normal file\/dll loading).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe and chrome.exe having network connections. That's normal, as svchost is a system process and chrome does a lot of network activity. But then there are multiple entries of chrome.exe doing registry value sets and pipe creations. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys, but just setting values isn't necessarily bad. The pipe creations might be part of normal communication, but multiple instances could be a sign of something else.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the path seems a bit odd. However, the same file is mentioned twice, which might just be a repeated event.\n\nThe updater.exe process is interesting. The command line shows it's connecting to clients2.google.com for crash reporting. The URL seems legitimate, but the presence of updater.exe with that command line might be normal for Google's update mechanism. However, I should check if the command line parameters are standard. The --database path and the attachment to the log file seem okay, but the initial-client-data parameters are a bit unclear. Maybe that's just part of the updater's normal operation.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe loading taskschd.dll from System32. That's a legitimate DLL, so that's probably normal. The process creation for svchost.exe with the BthAvctpSvc service is also a standard system process.\n\nLooking at all the events, the majority are from legitimate processes like chrome, svchost, and updater. The winlogbeat file creation might be part of setup, but not necessarily malicious. The registry and pipe events are common in normal operations. There's no indication of unusual network destinations, unexpected file modifications, or privilege escalation. \n\nHowever, the repeated registry value sets and pipe creations by chrome.exe could be worth looking into. But without more context, like changes to specific registry keys or unusual pipe names, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple events might just be normal behavior. \n\nOverall, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. They seem to be part of regular system and application operations. So, I think this batch is not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system and application behavior (e.g., svchost.exe network connections, chrome.exe registry\/pipe activity, legitimate updater.exe process).
