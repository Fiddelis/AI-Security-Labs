First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, etc. Some of these are common system processes, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are often used in attacks. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks. There are several Registry value set events, which might be normal, but when combined with other activities, could indicate changes to system settings. The Image loaded events mention urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded from an unusual context or in a way that's unexpected, that could be a red flag. Also, amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If there's an attempt to bypass or disable AMSI, that's a big red flag. But in these logs, it's just being loaded. Hmm.\n\nThen there's the cmd.exe command line: \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That's a command to delete processes named notepad.exe. That's suspicious because it's using WMIC to terminate processes, which could be part of a cleanup phase after an attack. Also, the command is run with \/c to execute a command and then exit, which is common in scripts. \n\nAnother entry has WMIC.exe with the command to delete notepad.exe processes. That's the same command. So there's an attempt to delete processes, which might be trying to remove evidence or stop legitimate processes. \n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but if it's creating a new configuration file, that might be normal if it's part of setup. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a sign of user activity, though not necessarily malicious. \n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries. There are multiple Process accessed events, which could be normal, but combined with other activities, might be part of a script. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious commands here. \n\nThe fact that there are multiple instances of Registry value set events, especially with svchost.exe and powershell.exe, could indicate that the attacker is modifying system settings or trying to persist. \n\nBut the most suspicious part is the use of WMIC to delete notepad.exe processes. That's a command that could be used to terminate processes that are being used for malicious activities, or to prevent the user from noticing the attack. Also, the presence of multiple Image Load events for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll might be related to attempting to bypass security mechanisms, though I'm not 100% sure. \n\nPutting it all together: the combination of deleting processes via WMIC, multiple registry changes, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe could indicate a potential malicious activity. However, some of these events could be legitimate. The confidence isn't 100% because there's not enough context, but the presence of these commands and events does raise a flag.

That's unusual because WMIC is often used in attacks, and loading a Defender DLL might be a tactic to mimic legitimate processes. Then, there are multiple entries of chrome.exe and other processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe performing registry value sets and process accesses. However, many of these are common processes that might be part of normal operations. The command line in one of the cmd.exe entries shows copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe, which is a classic attack technique to replace the Sticky Keys utility with a malicious one. Also, there's a schtasks command deleting a task named win32times, which could be part of cleaning up after an attack. The repetition of registry changes and process accesses might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or escalate privileges.

That's a legitimate system process, so probably normal. Then svchost.exe and registry events. Registry changes can be normal, but if there's a lot of them, maybe something's up. Then cmd.exe and powershell.exe showing up multiple times with registry value sets and process accesses. \n\nWait, there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. Also, chrome.exe is loading some DLLs. One of them is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. The other is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender as well. So those might be legitimate. \n\nBut then there's the repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with commands like \/c, which is used to run commands. The command_line for one cmd.exe is \"cmd.exe \/c \", which might be cut off, but that's a red flag. Also, the fact that whoami.exe is being executed multiple times could be normal, but combined with other activities, maybe not.\n\nLooking at the frequency: powershell.exe appears many times with ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The task is to analyze the entire batch and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, looking through the logs, most of them are about PowerShell.exe and some other processes. The first entry is 'whoami.exe', which is a normal command to get user information. But then there's a lot of PowerShell events. \n\nI notice that there are multiple 'Process Create' events for PowerShell with command lines like 'powershell.exe & {}'. That seems odd because the empty script block might be a way to bypass detection. Also, there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe if there's an unusual pattern here?\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is named something like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1'. That might be part of a script execution that's trying to clean up after itself. Also, the presence of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender could be related to antivirus activity, but maybe it's being used in a malicious way?\n\nLooking at the other events, there are a few 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be related to PowerShell's internal operations. However, the repetition of 'powershell.exe & {}' multiple times might indicate some kind of automated or scripted activity.\n\nBut wait, there's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of legitimate monitoring. However, if it's creating a new config file, maybe that's normal during setup.\n\nPutting it all together: the logs show multiple PowerShell processes, some with suspicious command lines, loading of DLLs, and a temporary file created and deleted. However, without more context, like unusual network activity or unexpected commands, it's hard to say. But the fact that there's a lot of PowerShell activity and some file operations that might be part of a script execution could be worth investigating.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loaded an image called MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. Wait, MpClient.dll is a legitimate file, but why is it being loaded by PowerShell? Maybe that's normal, but I should check if there are other suspicious activities.\n\nNext, there's a File created event in the user's AppData folder. The file is named StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Startup profiles are usually related to PowerShell configurations, but creating one in that location might be part of a setup, but maybe not necessarily malicious. However, I should note that.\n\nThen, several Registry value set events for PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag, especially if it's modifying keys related to execution policies or other security settings. But without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to say. Still, multiple registry changes might be suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple Process accessed events for PowerShell. That could indicate that another process is interacting with PowerShell, which might be normal, but again, depends on the context. Also, the command lines for PowerShell show a pattern where they're checking if certain batch files exist. The paths here are a bit strange with the '..' directories, which might be trying to access parent directories. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" – the '..' could be a way to traverse directories, maybe to access files that aren't directly in the current path. That might be a sign of obfuscation or trying to access files in different locations.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they're using Test-Path to check if these batch files exist and then exiting with 0 or 1. If these files don't exist, the script exits with 1. But why would someone do that? Maybe to check for the presence of certain files before executing them, or perhaps to see if they can access specific directories. However, if these batch files are malicious, this could be a precursor to executing them.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes being created with similar command lines. The paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands are all in different directories, and they use a pattern that includes '..' which might be an attempt to navigate the file system in a way that's not immediately obvious. This could be a technique used by malware to avoid detection by changing the path structure.\n\nAnother point is that several of the PowerShell processes are using the Provider Lifecycle task. I'm not entirely sure what that refers to, but if it's related to PowerShell providers (like the file system or registry providers), it might be normal. However, combined with the other events, it could indicate some form of interaction with the system that's not standard.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry modifications and file accesses, along with the PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of certain batch files, could be part of a larger attack. For example, the attacker might be trying to execute these batch files if they exist, which could be malicious. The fact that they're using relative paths with '..' might be an attempt to access files in different directories, possibly to bypass security measures or to hide the actual location of the malicious files.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these activities could be legitimate. For instance, creating a startup profile or modifying registry settings might be part of a software installation or configuration. But when combined with the repeated checks for batch files and the use of relative paths, it raises suspicion.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the image loaded events include mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to the .NET runtime. Loading these DLLs through PowerShell might be part of running .NET applications, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nIn summary, the key suspicious points are:\n- Multiple PowerShell processes checking for the existence of batch files in various directories, possibly using obfuscated paths.\n- Registry modifications that could alter system behavior.\n- Creation of a file in the AppData directory, which might be part of a setup or could be a dropper for malware.\n- The use of relative paths with '..' which might be an attempt to access files in a non-obvious way.\n\nWhile some of these activities could be legitimate, the combination of these events, especially the repeated checks for batch files and the registry changes, makes this batch of events worth investigating further. It's possible that this is part of a larger attack, such as a staged malware deployment where the initial checks are looking for the presence of certain files before proceeding with execution.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents several **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, though not definitively malicious without additional context. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual File Access and Path Obfuscation**\n- **Test-Path Commands with Relative Paths**:  \n  Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `Test-Path \"C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\"`.  \n  - **Suspicious Behavior**: The use of `..\\` (parent directory traversal) in paths may be an obfuscation technique to evade detection or access files in non-obvious locations.  \n  - **Potential Malicious Intent**: This could indicate a check for the existence of specific files (e.g., payloads or configuration files) before executing them. If these files are malicious, this could be a precursor to their activation.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Registry Modifications**\n- **Multiple \"RegistryEvent\" Entries**:  \n  PowerShell and `conhost.exe` are involved in modifying registry values.  \n  - **Risk**: Changes to registry keys (e.g., execution policies, startup entries, or security settings) can alter system behavior or bypass protections.  \n  - **Need for Context**: Without knowing the specific keys modified, this could be legitimate (e.g., software configuration) or part of an attack (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n\n---\n\n### **3. File Creation in Sensitive Locations**\n- **File Created in AppData**:  \n  A file named `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` is created in the user’s AppData directory.  \n  - **Concern**: AppData is a common location for legitimate user data, but creating a file named \"StartupProfile\" could be part of a **malicious dropper** or **configuration injection**.  \n  - **Follow-Up**: Check the file’s contents and timestamps to determine if it’s associated with unexpected activity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Image Loads from System Paths**\n- **MpClient.dll and .NET DLLs Loaded**:  \n  - `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender) and `.NET` runtime DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`) are loaded by PowerShell.  \n  - **Legitimacy**: These are legitimate system files, but **loading them via PowerShell** (instead of native processes) is unusual and could indicate **code injection** or **exploitation of a vulnerability**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**\n- **Repeated Process Creation and Access**:  \n  - Multiple `ProcessCreate` and `ProcessAccess` events for PowerShell, along with registry and file operations.  \n  - **Red Flag**: This could indicate **automated scripting** or **malware staging** (e.g., downloading additional payloads, establishing persistence, or evading detection).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Likely Worth Investigating**\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:  \n  - Unusual path obfuscation.  \n  - Registry modifications.  \n  - Suspicious file creation in AppData.  \n  - PowerShell used for non-standard system interactions.  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Analyze the contents of the `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file.  \n  - Correlate these events with network traffic (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs).  \n  - Check for additional files in directories referenced by the `Test-Path` commands.  \n  - Monitor for further PowerShell activity or execution of the batch files referenced in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verdict**  \n**Yes, this batch of events is suspicious and merits further investigation**. While some activities could be legitimate, the combination of obfuscated paths, registry modifications, and elevated PowerShell usage strongly suggests potential malicious activity (e.g., malware staging or persistence)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve 'powershell.exe' loading various DLL files from system directories like C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319. Those are legitimate system files, like clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. Then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal too, as Windows Defender components are expected to be present.\n\nNext, there are events where PowerShell creates and deletes a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating and deleting files is common during script execution, so maybe part of a normal process. However, the fact that it's creating a script file and then deleting it immediately might be worth looking into, but not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nAnother entry shows the creation of a file in the Downloads folder named 'elemento_padrao.txt'. That's a regular file name, so unless there's more context, it might not be suspicious. \n\nThen there are multiple entries about 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. Chrome often modifies the registry for updates or settings, so that's probably normal. However, the repetition of the same task multiple times might indicate something, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, there are PowerShell processes with command lines that check for the existence of certain batch files. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\", seem a bit generic. The use of Test-Path and exiting with 0 or 1 is part of script logic, but again, not inherently malicious. \n\nAnother event shows the loading of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which is a legitimate component. \n\nThen there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's part of PowerShell's startup profile, which might be normal if the user is configuring their environment. \n\nRegistry value sets by PowerShell could be part of script execution, but again, without knowing the specific keys being modified, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The majority of events involve legitimate system processes and files. The PowerShell activities are common in normal operations, like script execution and temporary file creation. The Chrome registry events are typical for an application. However, the repetition of certain events (like multiple registry sets by Chrome) might be a red flag, but not conclusive. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification is based on the combination of all events. Are there any patterns here? The PowerShell processes are loading legitimate DLLs, which is normal. The temporary script file is created and deleted, which could be part of a test or a normal script. The command lines checking for batch files might be part of a script that's checking dependencies. \n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity, like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or suspicious network activity. All the files mentioned are from legitimate sources. The only thing that stands out is the high number of Chrome registry events, but that might just be due to the number of logs provided. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the batch doesn't show any clear signs of malicious behavior. Therefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.6, as there's no strong evidence of a threat, but the logs aren't entirely benign either.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not exhibit clear indicators of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Legitimate System Activity**:  \n   - PowerShell processes are loading standard system DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, `MpClient.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) from trusted locations like Windows system directories and Windows Defender. These are expected behaviors for system and security software.\n\n2. **Script Execution Patterns**:  \n   - Temporary script files (e.g., in `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) are created and deleted, which is common during script execution. The command-line checks for batch files (e.g., `Test-Path`) appear to be part of dependency checks or conditional logic in scripts, not inherently malicious.\n\n3. **Chrome Registry Modifications**:  \n   - Multiple registry writes by Chrome are typical for application updates or configuration changes. While repetitive, this alone is not suspicious.\n\n4. **No Unusual Artifacts**:  \n   - No unexpected file paths, network activity, or anomalous process behaviors are observed. The `elemento_padrao.txt` file in the Downloads directory and PowerShell startup profile file creation are consistent with normal user activity.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe events align with routine system and application operations. No definitive signs of compromise or malicious intent are present.  \n\n**Classification**: **NOT INTERESTING**  \n**Confidence**: **0.6** (Moderate—no clear threats, but logs lack context for full benignity confirmation)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing different system events. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The first entry is a process creation of powershell.exe with a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content. It's creating a batch file and writing \"dir\" into another. That seems suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating files with commands might be part of an attack.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. The registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag. The Image Load events mention loading .dll files from system directories, which is normal, but the presence of multiple .dlls from .NET and Windows Defender might be normal too. However, the repeated use of PowerShell in these events is notable.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, each one has a pattern: creating a new item (file or directory) and setting content to \"dir\". The paths are all over the place, which might be an attempt to hide or spread the script. The use of \"..\" in the paths could be trying to traverse directories, maybe to evade detection.\n\nAlso, the \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with similar command structures might indicate automated or repeated actions. The fact that so many PowerShell processes are involved in creating and modifying files could be part of a larger attack, like establishing persistence or exfiltrating data.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this is just normal activity. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but the frequency and the specific commands here are concerning.

The first event shows a PowerShell command creating files and setting their content to \"dir\". Then there's a file created in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to drop files. But then that same file is deleted, which might be a red flag. The next events mention creating files in various paths, some of which have \"..\\\" which could be directory traversal attempts. \n\nThere's also a check for a file's existence, which might be part of a script that's trying to determine if a file is present, possibly for persistence or checking if a payload has been executed before. \n\nThe registry events and image loads (like Mscoree.dll, clr.dll) are normal for PowerShell, but the repeated file creation and the use of ..\\ in paths could indicate something malicious.

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with the process \"powershell.exe\" executing commands that check if certain batch files exist. The command lines all follow a similar pattern: using Test-Path to check for a specific .bat file and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that. The paths mentioned are a mix of different directories, some looking a bit odd with parts like \"..\\\\registro_logico\\\\\" which might be trying to navigate up a directory. But I need to see if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen, there are events related to file operations. One mentions a file created in the Temp directory, then immediately deleted. That's common for scripts that generate temporary files, but sometimes malicious scripts do that to avoid leaving traces. However, the file name here is __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which sounds like it could be part of a legitimate PowerShell policy test. But I should note that.\n\nAnother event is about a pipe created, which might be normal, but not sure yet. Then there's an image loaded event for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe if there's something unusual about how they're being loaded?\n\nLooking at the other entries, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably normal if someone is setting up monitoring. The registry value set and process access events might be part of normal operations, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that all the initial PowerShell commands are checking for the existence of specific .bat files. If these files are not present, the script exits with 1. But why would someone do that? Maybe they're checking if certain scripts are in place as part of a setup or configuration. However, the paths mentioned are a bit generic and don't immediately point to known malicious directories. \n\nBut wait, the use of multiple Test-Path commands in different locations might be an attempt to check for the presence of scripts in various places, possibly as part of a larger attack chain. However, without seeing the actual content of those .bat files, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. The fact that they're using PowerShell to check paths might be part of a legitimate script, but combined with other events like file creation and deletion, it could be a red flag.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because none of the events are clearly malicious on their own. The PowerShell commands are common in both legitimate and malicious contexts. The file creation and deletion in Temp are normal, and the Defender DLLs being loaded are expected. However, the repeated Test-Path checks might indicate some automated process, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation unless there's more context. The justification would be that the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity, just normal or ambiguous operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events contain routine PowerShell operations (e.g., file existence checks), temporary file creation\/deletion, and legitimate Windows Defender DLL loading.

However, the repeated use of these checks could be part of an attack. For example, an attacker might be checking if certain malicious files are present, or maybe trying to determine if a payload is already on the system.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple instances of PowerShell being used with the same structure. The 'Provider Lifecycle' task might be related to something like PowerShell providers, which are used for accessing different data stores. But the fact that there are so many similar commands could indicate automation or a script that's running multiple checks.\n\nAlso, there are entries where PowerShell loads .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are normal for PowerShell, but the repeated loading might be part of the script's execution. However, the main thing is the checking of those file paths. If these files are not standard or are in unusual locations, that could be suspicious. The paths here are all under 'C:\\' with various subdirectories, but the names don't immediately ring alarm bells. However, the fact that they're checking for the existence of these files multiple times might be part of a larger operation, like checking for the presence of a backdoor or a component of a malware.\n\nBut then again, some of these could be legitimate. For example, a software installation might check for the presence of certain files before proceeding. However, the repetition and the number of checks might be more indicative of an automated process. Also, the use of PowerShell for these checks is common, but in combination with the specific paths and the number of events, it's worth looking into further.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events are not overtly malicious, but the pattern of checking multiple file paths in a structured way could be part of a larger malicious activity. Since the user asked to consider the entire batch, the repeated checks and the specific paths might be enough to flag this as interesting for investigation. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while there's no direct evidence of a threat, the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands that check for the existence of specific files in non-standard paths, which could indicate probing for payloads or checking for the presence of malicious components.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions an image loaded from a Windows Defender DLL, which might be normal, but then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script. Then, the same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a script in Temp could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use Temp directories to execute malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Then several events with 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. The command lines here are checking if certain executables exist and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script checking for dependencies or setup files. However, the paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\registro_temporario\\\\registro_secundario\\\\bin\\\\componente_secundario.exe\" don't look standard. They have a lot of Spanish terms like \"registro\" which means \"register\" or \"log,\" which might be a red flag if these are not part of legitimate software.\n\nAnother event shows a registry value set and process accessed, which could be normal, but repeated access might indicate something. Then, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign but can be used to check the current user. The cmd.exe process is running a command to check if a file exists in the Temp directory. The file name \"objeto_logico.txt\" again has Spanish terms, which might be part of a naming convention, but could also be obfuscation.\n\nThe repeated 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The key points here are the non-standard paths, the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, and the use of PowerShell for checking file existence. These could be part of a legitimate script, but combined with the unusual file paths and multiple registry and process accesses, it might be worth investigating further.\n\nI should also check if any of the files are known malicious. The MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are part of Windows Defender, so those are legitimate. The other files in the Temp directory might be temporary, but the paths are suspicious. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some suspicious elements, they could also be part of normal operations.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL entries, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe processes. There are several 'Process accessed' events, which might be normal, but I should check for any suspicious patterns. Then there's a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate command to get user info, so that's probably okay.\n\nWait, there are multiple instances of PowerShell being accessed and creating processes. But what stands out are the 'Image loaded' events. The files loaded here are all .dll files from the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard components, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. However, the fact that PowerShell is loading so many .NET DLLs might be a red flag. Typically, PowerShell can use .NET assemblies, but if it's loading a lot of them, maybe there's something unusual happening.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some of the PowerShell processes, they're using Test-Path to check for the existence of specific .cs files. The paths mentioned are things like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...\" and similar. These paths don't look like standard system directories. The presence of multiple Test-Path commands checking for .cs files might indicate that the attacker is trying to determine if certain files exist, possibly part of a check for a compromised system or looking for specific files to exploit.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' events with PowerShell commands that check for the existence of .cs files in various directories. This repetition might be part of a script that's probing the system for certain files, which could be part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of a backdoor or a specific configuration file.\n\nAnother point is the number of events. There are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, the combination of these events, especially with the .NET DLLs and the Test-Path commands, might indicate that someone is using PowerShell for more than just simple tasks. The repeated checks for .cs files could be part of a script that's looking for specific files to execute or modify.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe this is part of a legitimate application that uses PowerShell and .NET. However, the lack of any other processes or files that might indicate normal activity, combined with the repetitive nature of the Test-Path commands, makes me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the repeated PowerShell activity, loading .NET DLLs, and checking for .cs files in non-standard paths might be indicative of malicious behavior. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence like file modifications or network activity, but the combination of events does raise flags.

The first event mentions an image loaded from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... and then it's deleted. That could be part of a script testing, but maybe not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be a red flag. Sometimes malware does that to avoid leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't always bad, but if there's unusual activity here, it might be worth checking. Then there are several events where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The names of these files are repetitive and seem to be part of different paths. The fact that the same script name is being checked in multiple locations might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a specific script, possibly to execute it later.\n\nThe command lines in some events have Test-Path commands checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious because \"Get-Keystrokes\" could be related to keylogging, which is a common malicious activity. Even though the scripts aren't being executed yet, the fact that the system is checking for their presence might be part of a larger plan to run them.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a normal command to check user identity, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it might be part of a sequence where the attacker is checking privileges or user context before proceeding.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these activities could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell scripts are often used in administrative tasks, and checking file paths is common. But the repetition of checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various directories and the deletion of temporary files might indicate something more sinister. The presence of multiple Test-Path commands with the same script name across different paths suggests that the attacker is trying to find where that script is located, possibly to execute it, which would be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of the Temp directory for creating and deleting files. While temporary files are normal, the pattern of creating and deleting might be an attempt to hide activity. Also, the involvement of PowerShell in multiple events could be a sign of a PowerShell-based attack, which is a common technique for attackers.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there are enough suspicious activities here to warrant further investigation. The repeated checks for a potentially malicious script, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the use of PowerShell in multiple events all point towards possible malicious behavior.

The command lines mention checking if a file called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in various paths. The script is using Test-Path and exiting with 0 or 1 based on whether the file is present. That seems suspicious because Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a keystroke logging script, which is often used in malware to capture user input.\n\nThen there are several Image Load events where PowerShell is loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are normal for PowerShell, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll might be a red flag. Maybe the script is interacting with antivirus components, which could be an attempt to bypass them or check their status.\n\nThere's also a File Create and Delete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Creating and then immediately deleting a file might be a way to execute a script without leaving traces, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nThe Pipe Created event could be related to inter-process communication, which might be legitimate but could also be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe repeated use of Test-Path with different directory paths suggests that the attacker is checking for the presence of a specific script in multiple locations. This could be part of a persistence mechanism or checking for conditions before executing malicious code.\n\nHowever, some of the events are just normal PowerShell operations, like loading necessary DLLs. The key here is the combination of the Test-Path commands with the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 file, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The fact that the script is being checked in multiple directories and the use of temporary files adds to the suspicion.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since there are multiple indicators pointing towards possible keystroke logging and evasion techniques, the confidence is high. But I need to make sure not to overstate it. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs might be a false positive, but combined with the other events, it's more likely to be malicious.\n\nSo, the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.85 because the combination of checking for a keystroke logging script, temporary file creation, and loading of Defender DLLs suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes repeatedly check for the presence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various directories, suggesting potential keystroke logging attempts.

The user wants me to determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's under AppData, which is a common place for legitimate configurations, but sometimes attackers use similar paths for persistence. However, just creating a file there might not be malicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are several entries about powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. Multiple ProcessAccess events could indicate someone is trying to manipulate or monitor other processes, which is a red flag. But again, it depends on the context. If it's a normal user doing some scripting, it might be okay. However, repeated access could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so that's probably benign. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are also normal applications, so their registry changes might be part of legitimate activities.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, both urlmon.dll are from the System32 directory, which is expected. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file there could be part of its normal operation. However, if the user didn't install it, that might be suspicious. But the event doesn't show any signs of malicious activity here.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is often used by attackers. The multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent entries might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or access sensitive information. However, without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say.\n\nThe Chrome browser has several network connections and DNS queries. That's normal for a browser, but if there's a sudden spike or connections to suspicious domains, that's a problem. The events here don't mention any unusual domains, though.\n\nPutting it all together: while there's a lot of activity from PowerShell and some registry changes, none of the events directly point to malicious behavior. The file creations and process accesses could be part of legitimate operations, especially if the user is an admin or running scripts.

Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed a few times. Process access events are common, but maybe if it's too frequent? But here, it's multiple entries, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is executed. That's a legitimate command to get user info. But maybe if it's part of a larger pattern. However, alone, it's not necessarily bad.\n\nThen, there are several events where powershell.exe is creating processes, accessing the registry, and loading images. The image loaded events include some .NET DLLs, which are standard for PowerShell. But wait, there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes: it's using ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. That's just listing files recursively, which is a normal command. But if done in a suspicious context, maybe. However, combined with the file creation and deletion, maybe there's more going on.\n\nAlso, the events include multiple registry value sets. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key points here are the file creation and deletion in the Temp folder.

The command lines show commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These are all PowerShell commands for recursively listing files and directories. That's a common legitimate use case, but sometimes attackers use these commands to search for files, maybe looking for sensitive data or to move laterally in a network. However, just seeing these commands isn't enough to flag it as malicious yet.\n\nNext, there's an event where the 'winlogbeat.exe' process creates a file named '.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But I should check if there's anything unusual about the file path or the context. The path seems to be in the Downloads directory, which is a common place for users to store files, but maybe not the best place for a log shipper's configuration. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the 'MpClient.dll' file from Windows Defender. The image load event here is probably normal, as Windows Defender's components are legitimate. But if there were any unexpected behaviors around this, like unusual process interactions, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the event just mentions the image being loaded, which is standard.\n\nThere are also several registry value set events. PowerShell and conhost.exe modifying registry values could be part of normal operations, but again, it depends on the specific keys and values changed. Since the logs don't provide details on the registry changes, it's hard to assess their legitimacy.\n\nThe repetition of PowerShell commands and file creation events might indicate that the user is performing some administrative tasks or testing. However, the lack of any clear malicious indicators like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or access to sensitive files makes it harder to classify this as suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these points, the events don't show clear signs of a security incident. The activities observed are common in both legitimate and potentially malicious scenarios.
