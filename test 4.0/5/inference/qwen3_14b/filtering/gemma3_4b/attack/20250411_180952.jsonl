The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, and chrome.exe doing similar things. Those seem normal. Chrome and svchost are common processes, and DNS queries and network connections are typical. But then I notice that chrome.exe has multiple network connections detected. Maybe that's normal, but maybe not. Let me check further.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami.exe is usually used to get user info, which isn't necessarily bad. But then there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a user and adds them to the Domain Admins group. The command line has \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands with domain admin privileges. That's a red flag. Adding a user to Domain Admins is a high-privilege action and could be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and later \"elemento_ativo_pass123!\" and \"unidade_temporario_pass123!\". These passwords look like they might be temporary or test passwords, but the fact that they're being added to Domain Admins is concerning. Also, the use of \"net1.exe\" which might be a typo or a malicious binary (since it's not the standard \"net.exe\") could indicate something wrong.\n\nThen there's the creation of files like .winlogbeat.yml.new and pacote_base.txt. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating a new config file might be normal if it's part of an update, but in this context, combined with other activities, it's suspicious. Also, the repeated file creation by svchost.exe in SRUtmp.log might be normal system logging, but not sure.\n\nOther events include registry value sets by cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence. The presence of multiple process accesses by powershell.exe might indicate it's being used to execute commands or scripts.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of domain admin users, use of suspicious commands, multiple network connections, and file\/registry changes could indicate an attacker trying to gain elevated privileges and establish persistence. The combination of these events is not normal and suggests a potential security incident. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin users via 'net' commands, execution of PowerShell and CMD processes with domain administration privileges, and creation of potential malicious files. The combination suggests potential privilege escalation and lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage tracking, so that might be normal. But sometimes malware can hide in system directories.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, but the .new extension might indicate a temporary file. However, if it's in the expected location, maybe that's okay. But I should check if the file path is normal for winlogbeat's operations.\n\nThen there are two events from powershell.exe. One is a registry value set, and another is a process accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The registry change could be part of configuration, but combined with process access, it might be something like a script modifying system settings or accessing other processes. \n\nPutting it all together: The first event is in a system directory, which might be normal. The second is a legitimate process creating a config file. The PowerShell events are more suspicious, especially if they're part of a sequence that modifies the registry and accesses other processes. However, without more context like the specific registry keys changed or the processes accessed, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of system file creation and PowerShell activities could be indicative of something worth investigating. Maybe the user is configuring something, but the presence of multiple events might suggest an attack chain. I'm leaning towards INTERESTING but not 100% confident. Maybe 0.65 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell and file creation in sensitive directories may indicate potential malicious activity, though not definitively confirmed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
