So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all have process commands involving PowerShell. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the principal is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights and running calc.exe, which is a harmless app but here might be a red flag. \n\nWait, why calc.exe? Usually, attackers might use something more隐蔽, but maybe they're testing or using it as a placeholder. The repeated creation of scheduled tasks with the same structure but different names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc., could be part of an attempt to establish persistence. \n\nThen there are other events with PowerShell related to registry value sets and process accesses. But the key points are the scheduled task creations. Each of those commands is using PowerShell to register a scheduled task that runs calc.exe under admin rights. Even though calc.exe isn't malicious, the method and the use of admin privileges could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or set up persistence. \n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple such events with different task names might suggest automation or a script that's generating multiple tasks. The presence of multiple scheduled tasks registered in this way could be a sign of malicious activity, even if the payload is a benign executable. \n\nThe other events involving chrome.exe and image loads of mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll might be normal, but the PowerShell activities are the main concern here. Since the tasks are registered with high privileges, this could be an attempt to gain persistence or execute code with elevated rights. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin rights using PowerShell is a suspicious pattern. Even though the immediate action is to run calc.exe, the method and the context (multiple tasks, admin privileges) make this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is high because these are classic indicators of compromise, even if the specific payload isn't malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) under BUILTIN\\\\Administrators group, executing calc.exe. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence through scheduled tasks with elevated permissions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they're all about PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are all legitimate .NET Framework files, so that's probably normal. But then there's an entry where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory called __PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1, and then deletes it. That's a bit odd. Why create and delete a script? Maybe a test, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command line that's pretty suspicious. It's using ScheduledTask to run calc.exe at logon with high privileges for Administrators. The command line is using the ScheduledTask module, which is a legitimate tool, but creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe might be a red flag. Usually, attackers use this method to execute malicious code under a user's context. The fact that it's setting the principal to Administrators with RunLevel Highest is concerning. This could be part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. But Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much unless it's updating itself. However, if there are a lot of these events, it might indicate something's wrong. But since the user hasn't provided more context, it's hard to say. However, the Chrome events don't seem as suspicious as the PowerShell ones.\n\nThen there are several entries where the process is None, and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. That's a big red flag. If the process is not specified, it might mean that the event is from a service or a system process that's not easily identifiable. But executing remote commands without a clear process could be a sign of a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited, like in a RDP attack or something similar. However, these entries don't have any file paths or command lines, so it's a bit unclear. But the fact that there are so many of them (12 entries) might indicate a pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell events creating and deleting a script, the ScheduledTask command to run calc.exe with admin rights, and the multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events without a process. These could be signs of an attack. However, the 'Execute a Remote Command' events might be false positives or part of a legitimate process that's not logged properly. But combined with the PowerShell activity, it's more likely that there's something malicious going on here. The confidence isn't 100% because some of the events could be normal, but the combination of creating a script, scheduling a task with high privileges, and multiple remote commands is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior: creating\/deleting temporary scripts, loading legitimate system DLLs (possibly for obfuscation), and attempting to schedule a task with elevated privileges to execute calc.exe. Combined with 12 'Execute a Remote Command' events (potentially indicating remote code execution attempts), these patterns suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing some system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The first ten entries are all the same: process is None, winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and file is None. That seems repetitive. Maybe a lot of remote command executions, which could be suspicious, but maybe they're just normal activities? But having ten identical entries might indicate something automated or repeated.\n\nThen, looking further down, there's an entry with a process that's a PowerShell command. The command_line shows creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and setting it to run at logon for Administrators. That's a red flag. Scheduled tasks set with admin privileges could be part of an attack. Also, the name of the task is 'unidade_comum$object' which might be a random or obfuscated name to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loaded 'taskschd.dll'. WmiPrvSE is related to WMI, which is used for management tasks. But loading taskschd.dll might be normal, but combined with other events could be part of an attack. However, I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, multiple svchost.exe processes are involved in setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, if done in a way that's unusual, it might be malicious.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe creating a file in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum'. That path is part of the system tasks directory. Creating a new task there, especially with the name 'unidade_comum', which might be related to the PowerShell command earlier, could be a sign of a scheduled task being created by an attacker.\n\nThen, there's a PowerShell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for benign scripts, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack. Also, another PowerShell event creating a file named 'entrada_principal.txt' in the Downloads folder. Not sure yet, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nChrome.exe is involved in loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files for antivirus and security features. However, if Chrome is loading these, maybe it's a false positive or a legitimate process. But I don't see anything immediately wrong here.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. Probably not suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the key points are the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task for Administrators, the creation of a task in the System32\\Tasks directory, and multiple registry changes. These could indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence. However, some events might be normal. The repetition of 'Execute a Remote Command' might be part of a tool or script that's being used. \n\nBut the presence of a scheduled task with admin rights, combined with registry changes and file creations in system directories, seems suspicious. Even though some events might be benign, the combination suggests possible malicious activity. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence might be around 0.75 because while some events are suspicious, others are normal, but the combination is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected, including PowerShell creating a scheduled task with Administrator privileges, creation of a task in the system tasks directory, and repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting. So, looking at the batch, there are several entries with chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of them. But wait, is that normal? Chrome might modify the registry for updates or settings, but multiple entries in a short time could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a legitimate setup. But the file path has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates temporary files. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother entry is powershell.exe creating a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt. Objecto_auxiliar translates to auxiliary object in Spanish. That name seems generic, but maybe it's just a normal file. However, PowerShell is often used in malicious activities, so creating files with it might be a red flag.\n\nCombining all these: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be normal, but the presence of PowerShell creating a file and winlogbeat's activity might be part of a larger pattern. However, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say. The justification should mention the combination of registry changes and file creation by different processes. But since there's no clear malicious activity like unexpected network calls or execution of suspicious files, maybe it's not interesting. Wait, but the confidence level? Maybe 0.6? Not sure. Maybe the justification is that multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and file creation by PowerShell could be benign, but the combination might warrant further investigation. So classification is INTERESTING but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe registry modifications combined with PowerShell file creation may indicate benign activity, but the combination warrants further investigation for potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
