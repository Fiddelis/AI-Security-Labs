There are multiple entries for ProcessAccess, ImageLoad, and FileCreate. The command line for one of the powershell instances is creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$, which might indicate accessing a remote share. That's suspicious because it could be part of data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\nThen there's the FileCreate event where a temporary script file is created and then immediately deleted. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving a trace. The file path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a typical location for such activities.\n\nAlso, the ImageLoad events show loading of several DLLs, including ones related to .NET and Windows Defender.

The presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender could be part of a legitimate process, but if combined with other malicious actions, it might be an evasion technique.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication, possibly by malware.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed and created. PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used excessively or in certain ways, it can be a red flag. Then there's 'cmd.exe' with a command line that's cut off, which might be part of a larger command. However, just having cmd.exe isn't necessarily bad.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'whoami.exe' process. That's a legitimate tool for checking user identity, so that's probably normal. But then there are several 'Image loaded' events for various DLLs. Most of these are system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET and Windows Defender. Those are normal, but the presence of multiple image loads might be part of normal operations.\n\nWait, there's a file created in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1'. Then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script file in Temp could be suspicious. It might be part of a script that's being executed temporarily. Also, the name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which sounds like a test, but maybe it's a malicious script trying to bypass policies.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of PowerShell. If there are multiple process accesses and creations, it could indicate that someone is trying to run scripts or commands through PowerShell, which is a common method for attackers. The 'Pipe Created' event might be part of inter-process communication, which isn't always bad, but in combination with other events, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' event might indicate changes to the registry, which can be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But combined with the file creation and deletion, and multiple PowerShell activities, it's worth looking into.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the batch includes multiple PowerShell events, creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and loading of various DLLs. While some of these are normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to execute a script, possibly malicious. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the presence of the temporary script and repeated PowerShell usage suggests it's worth investigating further.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, almost all of them are related to powershell.exe. There are several entries where PowerShell is accessing processes, modifying registry values, and loading various DLLs. The presence of multiple registry value sets and process accesses might indicate some level of system manipulation. \n\nOne of the events shows the execution of whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. However, the fact that it's being run in the context of PowerShell could be part of a script. \n\nThe image loaded events are loading several DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, but there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of a temporary execution, but the deletion could be an attempt to cover tracks. \n\nAnother file created is in the StartupProfileData directory, which might be related to PowerShell profiles. However, the presence of multiple file creations and deletions, along with frequent registry changes and process accesses, could indicate malicious activity. \n\nBut wait, some of these events are normal operations. For example, PowerShell using .NET DLLs is standard. However, the combination of creating and deleting temporary files, along with registry modifications, might be suspicious. The user is asking if the batch is interesting, so I need to see if there's a pattern that suggests an attack. \n\nThe confidence level here is a bit tricky. There's no direct evidence of malware, but the behavior is unusual. The multiple registry sets and process accesses, combined with temporary file creation and deletion, could be indicative of an attack. However, without more context or specific malicious indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the classification would be INTERESTING because the combination of events shows potential for malicious activity, even if not conclusive.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's whoami.exe and powershell.exe being created or accessed. The svchost.exe is creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder. That's a normal system directory, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then, looking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that checks if a file exists at \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". Wait, the path has \"..\\\\registro_secundario\", which might be a way to traverse directories. But the actual path is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\" â€” that simplifies to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". Hmm, but I need to check if \"unidade_logico\" is a legitimate directory. Maybe it's a typo or a non-standard path.\n\nThen, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, so not necessarily bad. However, there's a File Created event for a temporary script file, which is then deleted. That could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection.\n\nThe key point here is the command line in one of the PowerShell processes. The command checks if procdump.exe exists in a certain path. Procdump is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals, but if it's being used in a suspicious context, it might be part of a malicious activity. However, just checking for the existence of the file doesn't immediately indicate malicious intent. But combined with the fact that PowerShell is being used extensively here, maybe there's something more.\n\nWait, looking at the command line again: the script is testing if procdump.exe exists. If it does, it exits 0; else, 1. That might be part of a larger script that's trying to determine if certain tools are available. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes, image loads, and file operations might be indicative of something. \n\nAlso, the fact that there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory could be a red flag. Attackers often use temporary files to execute scripts and then clean up. However, this is also common in legitimate scenarios. \n\nAnother thing is the repeated access to PowerShell processes. While PowerShell is a common tool, excessive use might be suspicious. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious part is the command line checking for procdump.exe. If that's part of a larger malicious script, it could be interesting. But on its own, it's not conclusive. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, file creation and deletion, and the use of procdump might warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting enough to flag for investigation.

The first event mentions 'Image loaded' for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but then there's a 'File created' event in the user's AppData folder. That's a bit suspicious because creating files in user-specific directories can be part of malware persistence.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe. Frequent access to processes and registry changes could indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or inject code. The 'whoami.exe' processes are normal, but they're being called multiple times, which might be part of checking user context.\n\nThe big red flag here is the 'cmd.exe' command to disable the firewall using 'netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off'. Disabling the firewall is a clear sign of malicious activity because it removes a security layer. The 'netsh.exe' process executing that command is definitely something to investigate.\n\nThen there's a bunch of 'svchost.exe' events related to registry changes. svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but excessive registry modifications could be part of a broader attack, like persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple suspicious process creations, registry changes, file creation in user directories, and most notably, disabling the firewall.

The key here is that all events are the same. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware because it's common. However, if there's a lot of activity related to the registry, that might be suspicious.\n\nBut wait, all the events are identical. That's a red flag. If the same process is triggering the same registry event multiple times, maybe it's part of a malicious activity, like modifying registry keys to persist or hide. However, since the events are all the same and there's no variation in the details (like different registry keys or other processes involved), it's possible that this is just a normal system event being logged multiple times, or maybe a false positive.\n\nBut the problem is that the user is asking if the entire batch is interesting. Since all events are the same, and there's no additional context like different registry paths or other processes, it's hard to determine if this is malicious. However, the sheer number of events (28 entries) might indicate something. But again, without more data, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say.\n\nOn the other hand, if the system is generating these events repeatedly, maybe there's a script or process that's causing a loop in the registry. But again, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple identical events might be a sign of something wrong, but it could also be a legitimate process that's just generating a lot of logs.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the classification is 'NOT INTERESTING' because there's no variation in the events, and they all point to the same process and task. However, the high volume might be a concern.

That's repeated multiple times. Then there's one entry where the task is 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)' and another with 'Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)'. Then there are several entries with a command line involving PowerShell executing 'New-PSDrive' to map a network drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$.\n\nHmm. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry. However, multiple registry events might be normal too, but if they're all from svchost, maybe that's okay. But wait, the PowerShell commands are creating a new PSDrive with a network path. That's typically used to access remote file systems. The command line here is using 'New-PSDrive' with the -unidade_auxiliar parameter, which seems like a typo or maybe a non-English term. Wait, the parameter is '-unidade_auxiliar', which in Portuguese means 'auxiliary unit'â€”maybe the user is using a Portuguese version of PowerShell? That could be a red flag if it's unexpected in the environment.\n\nAlso, the fact that this command is being run multiple times by PowerShell might indicate an attempt to establish a persistent connection or access a remote system. The use of 'New-PSDrive' to map a network drive could be part of a script that's trying to access files on the target machine, which is a common technique in malicious activities like data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\nBut I need to check if there are other suspicious activities. The other events are all registry and pipe events from svchost, which might be normal. However, the PowerShell commands are more concerning. If this is part of a legitimate script, maybe, but repeated execution of the same command might be suspicious. Also, the presence of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events could indicate that the PowerShell provider is being manipulated, which might be part of a malicious action.\n\nPutting this together, the batch includes both normal system events and some PowerShell commands that could be indicative of malicious activity. The combination of multiple registry events and the PowerShell commands mapping a network drive might be worth investigating further.
