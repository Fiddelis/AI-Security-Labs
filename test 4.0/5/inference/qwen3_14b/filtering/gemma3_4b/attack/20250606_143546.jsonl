That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The events include Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Image Load. \n\nOne of the entries has a command line for powershell.exe that's importing a module from a path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of \"..\" in the path might indicate trying to access a parent directory, which could be a red flag. Also, the script name \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" sounds like it could be part of a malicious payload, maybe obfuscated or trying to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads might be normal for PowerShell scripts. However, the fact that it's loading several system DLLs could be part of a larger malicious process, like trying to inject code or execute payloads.\n\nAnother point is the File Create and File Delete events. The temporary file created and then immediately deleted might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. The file path is in the Temp directory, which is common for malicious activities to store temporary files.\n\nThe event with \"Pipe Created\" could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe svchost.exe events are related to system services, and creating a file in the SoftwareDistribution directory might be part of legitimate Windows Update activities. However, the Registry value set event might indicate some changes to the system configuration, which could be suspicious if not expected.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes, suspicious file paths, loading of various DLLs, creation and deletion of temporary files, and registry changes. These could indicate a potential security incident, like a PowerShell-based attack or script execution that's trying to be stealthy. However, some of these events could also be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts.

So, first, looking at the data, there are multiple entries with processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, sppsvc.exe, and powershell.exe. The winlog tasks include Registry value set, File created, and Image loaded. \n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a common system process, so seeing it multiple times might be normal. But then there's HxTsr.exe. Wait, HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. That might be suspicious. Also, the file paths for some of the created files are in the SoftwareDistribution directory, which is related to Windows updates. But creating multiple Metadata DLLs there could be part of a legitimate update, but maybe not. \n\nLooking at the other processes: sppsvc.exe is related to Windows activation, so creating a cache.dat file there might be normal. However, the presence of HxTsr.exe doing a registry value set could be a red flag. Also, the fact that there are several ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. Those are legitimate DLLs, but if they're being loaded from unexpected processes, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, the HxTsr.exe is setting a registry value. Since HxTsr.exe isn't a known legitimate process, that could indicate a malicious activity. Also, the combination of multiple registry changes and file creations, especially in system directories, might suggest something is wrong. \n\nBut I should check if there's any other suspicious activity. The powershell.exe entries are creating a StartupProfileData file, which might be part of normal user activity. However, if PowerShell is being used for unexpected tasks, that could be a problem. But in this case, the file path seems legitimate.\n\nThe key points here are the presence of HxTsr.exe and the multiple registry and file events. Since HxTsr.exe is not a standard process and is modifying the registry, that's a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior. Even though some of the other processes are legitimate, the combination with HxTsr.exe's activity makes this batch interesting for investigation. \n\nI think the confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the presence of an unknown process making changes could be indicative of something malicious. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7 or 0.75.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events are from svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. The tasks mentioned are Registry value set and File created. There's also an Image loaded event for taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler, so that's normal.\n\nNow, looking at the files created. There's a waasmedic.etl file in the Windows Logs directory. WAASMedic is related to Windows Update, so that's probably legitimate. Then there's edbtmp.log in SoftwareDistribution, which is part of the Windows Update client, so that's normal too. Another file in the Download directory with a long hash-like nameâ€”maybe a Windows Update component. The DeliveryOptimization Cache file is also related to Windows Update, which is standard.\n\nHowever, I notice that most of the events are Registry value sets. While svchost.exe modifying the registry isn't unusual, if there were a lot of suspicious changes, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the logs don't show any specific malicious registry keys or unusual values. The file creations are all in expected locations for Windows Update activities. Also, one event has the process as None, which might be a system process or a service, but the file created is a WindowsUpdate log file, which is normal.\n\nSince all the activities are related to legitimate system processes and files associated with Windows Update, there's no indication of malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install directory. That path is part of Windows Update, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file named AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. Delta patches are usually updates, but sometimes malicious actors use similar names. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is bad.\n\nNext, MpSigStub.exe is involved. This is a legitimate Windows Defender process, but there are multiple file creations in the Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. These files might be part of a legitimate update, but the presence of multiple files in Temp could be a red flag. Also, the paths include a long random string, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the file name. But again, Windows Defender sometimes uses such naming conventions for updates.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating several files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. The files include things like ie_to_edge_stub.exe, cookie_exporter.exe, and elevation_service.exe. Some of these names sound like legitimate components, but others like \"elevated_tracing_service.exe\" might be suspicious. However, Microsoft Edge does have some services with similar names. Still, the fact that setup.exe is creating these files could be normal during installation.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe and powershell.exe events don't seem immediately suspicious. RuntimeBroker is part of UAC, and ProcessAccess events can be normal. However, if there's no other suspicious activity, these might not be concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple file creations by legitimate processes in directories that are sometimes used by malware (like Temp), but the files themselves are associated with Windows Defender and Edge updates. However, the presence of delta patches and the number of files created might indicate an update process, which is normal. But the combination of svchost.exe creating a delta patch file, MpSigStub.exe creating temp files with odd names, and setup.exe creating Edge-related executables could be part of a legitimate update. However, without more context or indicators of compromise, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, I think the answer is yes. The activities are somewhat normal but have elements that could be indicative of malicious activity if not properly contextualized. The presence of multiple file creations by system processes, even if legitimate, might warrant further investigation to confirm they are part of a known update process and not something malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of **legitimate system activity** and **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **svchost.exe & Delta Patch File**:\n   - **File**: `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe` in `SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install`.\n   - **Context**: While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, the filename resembles a **delta patch** (common in software updates). However, **delta patches are not typically created directly by `svchost.exe`**. This could indicate:\n     - A **legitimate update** (e.g., Windows Update).\n     - A **malicious actor** mimicking update processes (e.g., rogue software or malware).\n\n2. **MpSigStub.exe & Temp Files**:\n   - **Files**: `mpasdlta.vdm`, `mpavdlta.vdm` in a Temp directory with obfuscated paths (e.g., `{9B5BB341-A9A7-429D-9B7A-0FA519016564}\\mpengine.dll`).\n   - **Context**: `MpSigStub.exe` is a **legitimate Windows Defender component**, but the **creation of multiple `.vdm` files** (virus definition modules) in Temp directories is **unusual**. While Windows Defender may update definitions, **this behavior is not standard** and could suggest:\n     - **Malicious tampering** with Defender's update process.\n     - **False positives** (e.g., benign updates with odd naming).\n\n3. **setup.exe & EdgeCore Executables**:\n   - **Files**: `ie_to_edge_stub.exe`, `cookie_exporter.exe`, `elevated_tracing_service.exe` in `Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore`.\n   - **Context**: These files are associated with **Microsoft Edge**, but the presence of `elevated_tracing_service.exe` and `elevation_service.exe` raises concerns. While some Edge components may have similar names, **unauthorized installation of Edge-related executables** (especially via `setup.exe`) could indicate:\n     - **Malware masquerading as Edge components**.\n     - **Unintended software installation** (e.g., bundled with other applications).\n\n4. **RuntimeBroker.exe & PowerShell**:\n   - **Events**: `Registry value set` by `RuntimeBroker.exe` and `Process accessed` by `PowerShell.exe`.\n   - **Context**: These are **common legitimate activities** (e.g., UAC prompts, script execution). However, **PowerShell access events** should be scrutinized for signs of **script-based attacks** (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`).\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Concern**\n- **Unusual File Creation**: Multiple `.vdm` files in Temp directories by `MpSigStub.exe` (not typical behavior).\n- **Delta Patch File**: `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe` in `SoftwareDistribution` (could be a red herring or malicious).\n- **EdgeCore Executables**: Uncommon filenames (e.g., `elevated_tracing_service.exe`) in a directory typically reserved for Edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Known Good Activity**:\n   - Check if the files (`AM_Delta_Patch_...`, `.vdm`, EdgeCore executables) are part of **recently approved updates** or **legitimate software installations**.\n   - Verify the **hashes of the files** against trusted repositories (e.g., Microsoft's official hashes).\n\n2. **Investigate PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Review the **PowerShell script** involved in the `Process accessed` event for malicious commands (e.g., downloading payloads, modifying registry keys).\n\n3. **Monitor Defender Logs**:\n   - Check **Windows Defender logs** for signs of **definition update tampering** or **malware detection** related to the `.vdm` files.\n\n4. **Check for Unauthorized Software**:\n   - Audit the **installation of Edge-related components** via `setup.exe` to ensure they were **user-initiated** and **trusted**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`) is legitimate, the combination of **unusual file creation**, **obfuscated paths**, and **EdgeCore executables** raises **red flags**. This warrants **further investigation** to rule out **malicious activity** or **false positives**."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is executed. That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably benign. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is often used by attackers, so I need to check the command lines and other activities.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a PowerShell command that creates a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". That's suspicious because creating a new service isn't typical for normal user activities. Also, the path is in a non-standard directory like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\\". That might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of them are .NET framework DLLs, which is normal, but there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That could be legitimate, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a sign of something else. However, the main issue here is the service creation.\n\nThen, a temporary file is created and deleted: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1\". The creation and immediate deletion might be part of a script execution that's trying to hide its tracks. Also, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a legitimate test, but combined with other actions, it's worth looking into.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events for services.exe. That could be part of normal service configuration, but if done in a short time frame, it might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or install backdoors.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a custom executable, loading of potentially malicious DLLs, and the use of PowerShell for scripting that creates and deletes files could be signs of a malicious activity. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese) might be a placeholder or obfuscation. The fact that the service is started immediately after creation is another red flag.\n\nHowever, some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But given the combination of eventsâ€”especially the service creation, the unusual file paths, and the multiple registry changesâ€”it's more likely that this is a security incident that needs further investigation.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each line.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is 'tarefa_logico.exe' and it's loading various DLL files from the Windows System32 and .NET Framework directories. Those paths look legitimate, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal if the application is a .NET app, so maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's a 'powershell.exe' process creating a file in the AppData directory. That's common for PowerShell profiles, so maybe not a big deal. But then there's a registry value set event, which could be normal too unless it's changing something malicious.\n\nNext, there's an entry where the process is None, but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' pointing to a .ps1 file in 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The path has 'unidade_logico' which might be a custom directory, not the standard ones. Also, executing a remote command could be a red flag, especially if it's from an unusual location.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with the same command line for PowerShell. The command imports a module from that same .ps1 file, tries to invoke 'Invoke-entrada_principal' with OutputDirectory set to $env:Temp, and then sleeps. The use of $env:Temp is common, but the fact that it's importing a module from a non-standard path might be suspicious. Also, the repetition of the same command line multiple times could indicate that the process is being repeatedly executed, which might be part of a script or a loop.\n\nThe presence of 'Invoke-entrada_principal' is unclear. If that's a custom function, it might be part of a legitimate script, but without knowing the context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that it's being called from a non-standard path and combined with other events like executing remote commands and loading .NET assemblies might indicate some form of automated task or possibly a malicious script.\n\nPutting it all together: the initial .NET DLL loads might be normal, but the PowerShell activities, especially the repeated execution of a script from a non-standard location, could be indicative of something suspicious. The combination of loading .NET components and running PowerShell scripts might be part of a larger attack, like a PowerShell-based exploit or data exfiltration.

Then, it tries to invoke a function called Invoke-entrada_principal and starts a sleep. \n\nNext, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is used to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with the binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". This is repeated several times, which is suspicious because creating a service multiple times might be an attempt to persist or hide malicious activity. \n\nThen, there are several file events under the task \"Execute a Remote Command\" pointing to the same script \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\".

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing an event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries have the same structure. The \"winlog\" task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is always \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". There are several repetitions of this exact same event. Then there are a few other entries with different tasks like \"Logon\", \"Special Logon\", \"Security Group Management\", but those don't have a process name, except for \"services.exe\" in some cases.\n\nNow, the key thing here is the repetition. If the same event is logged multiple times, that might indicate something unusual. PowerShell scripts (.ps1) are often used in attacks, especially if they're executing remote commands. The fact that the same file is being referenced over and over again could be a sign of a persistent or repeated attempt to execute a command remotely, which might be malicious.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any context that might make this normal. For example, if this is part of legitimate system activity, but given that the process is listed as \"None\" for most entries, that's suspicious. Normally, processes would be associated with known executables. The absence of a process name might indicate that the event is being logged without proper context, which could be a sign of an attack or a misconfiguration.\n\nAlso, the repetition of the same file path multiple times could be a red flag. If this is a normal operation, you might expect varying file paths or different tasks. The fact that \"Execute a Remote Command\" is repeated so many times, especially with the same file, suggests a potential security threat.\n\nOn the other hand, there are entries with \"Logon\" and \"Special Logon\" tasks, which are normal system events. However, the majority of the logs are the same suspicious event. The confidence here would depend on how many times the same event occurs. Since there are over 20 instances of the same file being used to execute a remote command, that's a lot. Even if some are false positives, the repetition increases the likelihood of a real threat.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think this batch is interesting. The justification would be the repeated execution of the same PowerShell script with the same task, which is a common indicator of malicious activity.

The repeated execution of a remote command from the same PowerShell script might be suspicious.

The repetition of the same event multiple times could suggest that the script is being run repeatedly, possibly as part of a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration.
