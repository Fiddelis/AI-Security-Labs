The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is executed. That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably legitimate. But then there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being run. Now, PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, so I need to check the command lines.\n\nLooking at one of the PowerShell entries, the command line is using 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems suspicious because it's searching for passwords in files, which could be part of a password dumping or data exfiltration attempt. Also, there are multiple events with the same command line, which might indicate repeated attempts or automated scripts.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET framework DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but the presence of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to bypass defender or inject malicious code.\n\nAlso, a temporary file is created and then deleted. That's common in malware to avoid leaving traces, so that's another suspicious point. The Pipe Created event might be used for inter-process communication, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell commands searching for sensitive data, loading of specific DLLs, temporary file creation and deletion, and repeated events. These signs could indicate an attacker trying to find credentials or exfiltrate data. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate scripts. But the combination of these events, especially the repeated searches for passwords and the file operations, makes me lean towards this being a security incident. The confidence is high, but not 100% certain without more context. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for sensitive data (passwords) across files, coupled with temporary file creation\/deletion and loading of .NET framework DLLs, suggests potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

That seems like a potential reconnaissance activity, maybe looking for sensitive information. The same command appears again later, which might indicate repeated attempts.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe that's normal, but not sure yet. Other processes like notepad, calc, and svchost are common, but the multiple registry value sets could be something. However, the most suspicious part is the PowerShell command searching for passwords in files. That's a classic sign of someone trying to find credentials or sensitive data. \n\nAlso, there are multiple entries of PowerShell being accessed and processes created. The fact that the same command is used multiple times might indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure they don't miss any files. The presence of 'select-string' with '-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue' suggests they're trying to suppress errors, which is a tactic used to avoid detection.\n\nOther events involve Chrome and normal system processes, which don't seem suspicious. The winlogbeat file creation might be part of normal operations, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it's a bit concerning. However, without more context like unexpected network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit hard. But the repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords are a red flag. \n\nSo, I think this is interesting because the PowerShell command is likely part of a data extraction attempt. The confidence is around 0.75 because while it's not definitive proof of a breach, the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are searching for 'password' patterns in files across the system, which is a common technique used in reconnaissance to locate sensitive information.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to Chrome.exe performing normal activities like registry value sets, DNS queries, and network connections. Those alone might not be a red flag because Chrome does a lot of that. However, I notice a couple of other entries that stand out.\n\nThere's an entry where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a file there might be normal if it's part of its operation. But then, there's another entry where powershell.exe created a file named \"objeto_logico.txt\" in the same user's Downloads folder. That's a bit odd because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating a text file isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it might be worth checking.\n\nWait, but looking more closely, the only other notable event is the image loaded by chrome.exe pointing to MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably okay. However, there are multiple registry value sets by Chrome, which could be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys, that's a problem. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed, so that's a bit of a blind spot.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple DNS queries from Chrome, which is typical for browsing, but again, without context on the domains, it's hard to tell. The main thing is that all the events are from Chrome and other legitimate processes, with no obvious signs of malware or unauthorized access. The PowerShell file creation is the only slightly suspicious event, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. The events are mostly normal, and the few that are a bit unusual don't point to a clear threat. So I'd classify this as NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence, since there's no strong evidence of an incident, but there are some minor anomalies that aren't conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal chrome.exe operations (registry changes, DNS queries, network connections) and legitimate file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_ativo.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe part of regular user activity. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll note it.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe created a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its setup. Still normal unless there's something unusual about the file path or name.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed (ProcessAccess). This could be normal if it's part of legitimate scripts, but repeated access might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is created, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe commands, there's a schtasks \/delete command trying to delete scheduled tasks named things like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleaning up old tasks, but if these tasks are malicious, deleting them might be an attempt to remove evidence. However, the command is run with \/f, which forces deletion, so maybe the user is trying to remove tasks they created. But why so many different task names?\n\nAnother cmd.exe command uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. Using wmic to delete processes is unusual. Notepad.exe is a common process, but deleting it via wmic might indicate someone is trying to terminate processes, possibly to hide activities.\n\nThere are multiple instances of schtasks.exe being used to delete tasks. This could be part of a script that's cleaning up after itself. But combined with the wmic command, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nRegistry events are also present, with registry values being set. Changing registry settings can be part of configuring the system, but if done by an attacker, it might be to modify system behavior or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe repetition of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes might indicate that someone is trying to maintain persistence or alter system settings. The deletion of scheduled tasks could be to avoid detection, but it's also possible that these tasks were legitimate and the user is just cleaning up.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple process creations, registry modifications, and attempts to delete tasks and processes might be indicative of malicious activity. Especially the use of wmic to delete processes and the frequent use of powershell, which is often used in attacks.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any clear evidence of compromise. The events don't show any obvious malicious files or network activity. The file paths are in user directories, which could be normal. The tasks being deleted might be part of a legitimate script, but the repeated commands and the use of wmic could be suspicious.\n\nOverall, while some activities are normal, the combination of multiple suspicious commands, process accesses, and registry changes might warrant further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, I should look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a process called WMIC.exe with the command line \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That seems odd because WMIC is often used for system management, but deleting processes might be a red flag. Then, there are multiple entries where WMIC.exe loads DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and a Defender DLL. Loading amsi.dll is suspicious because AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware system. If a malicious process is loading AMSI, it might be trying to bypass detection.\n\nNext, there are several PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe processes with commands like deleting users (\"net user \/del\") and registry value changes. Deleting user accounts could be part of an attack to remove access points. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd to modify the registry and delete users is concerning. Also, the presence of \"conhost.exe\" and \"whoami.exe\" might be normal, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate something's wrong.\n\nThe events include multiple \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" tasks, which might be part of an attempt to modify system settings or escalate privileges. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of the standard \"net.exe\" could be a typo or a malicious replacement. Also, the user account management events might relate to the deletion of user accounts mentioned earlier.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of WMIC deleting processes, loading suspicious DLLs, PowerShell\/cmd modifying the registry, deleting user accounts, and the presence of multiple security-related processes being accessed or modified suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because these actions are commonly associated with attacks trying to escalate privileges, bypass security features, and remove traces.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice several processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe being used. Some commands stand out, like \"net user ... \/del \/domain\" which is deleting user accounts. That's a bit suspicious because deleting domain users might be part of a privilege escalation or lateral movement. Then there's \"sc delete win32times\" which is deleting a service. Deleting services isn't normal unless it's part of a cleanup, but combined with other actions, it might be malicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are multiple Registry value set events and Process Create events. The repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with commands related to user deletion and service removal could indicate an attacker trying to remove traces or take control. Also, the use of \"whoami.exe\" might be to check the current user context, which is common in attacks to confirm privileges.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, administrators might delete users or services during maintenance. But the combination of multiple user deletions, service deletions, and registry changes might be more indicative of malicious activity. The presence of both cmd.exe and powershell.exe with domain-related commands increases the suspicion. \n\nI should check if there's a pattern. The events include deleting users like \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\", \"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\", and \"tarefa_padrao_Admin\". Deleting multiple admin accounts could be part of taking over the domain. Also, the use of \"sc delete\" on a service named \"win32times\" might be targeting a specific service to disable it, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe confidence level isn't 100% because some actions could be legitimate, but the combination of events points towards a potential security incident.

The first event shows cmd.exe running a command to delete temporary files, which might be normal cleanup, but the use of %temp% and the filenames like \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\" raises a red flag. Then there are multiple entries for powershell.exe being accessed and process create events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms. The File Delete logged event for a .exe in the Temp directory might be part of a malicious payload being cleaned up after execution. The repeated Provider Lifecycle events with empty commands might be noise, but the Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are normal for PowerShell, so that's expected.\n\nHowever, the combination of deleting files, multiple process creations, and registry changes could indicate an attempt to hide activities or maintain persistence. The presence of \"decoded.exe\" in the filenames suggests possible obfuscation or encoded payloads. While some events are normal, the overall pattern of suspicious process creation, file deletion, and registry modifications points towards a potential security incident.

So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions 'Image loaded' for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. PowerShell scripts in Temp can sometimes be malicious. But then the same file is deleted, which might be part of a cleanup. \n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. Then, there's a command line with 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an empty command. Maybe a placeholder or a test. \n\nAnother image loaded event for MpClient.dll, also part of Windows Defender. That's probably legitimate. Then, a file created in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be normal PowerShell behavior, but could also be a sign of something trying to persist. \n\nThere are several Registry value set events, but the processes involved are PowerShell and conhost.exe. Conhost is a normal Windows process, so maybe not an issue. The Process accessed events are common, but when combined with other events, they might indicate something. \n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's normal. However, the repetition might be a red flag if it's being used in a loop or for enumeration. \n\nLooking at the overall pattern: PowerShell is creating and deleting files in Temp, accessing processes, and there are some registry changes. However, most of the events seem to be related to normal operations, like Windows Defender components. The presence of temporary files and process access might be benign, but the combination could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or manipulate the system. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. The fact that there are multiple Process accessed events and file creations\/deletions might not be enough on their own. However, the repeated execution of whoami.exe could be part of a reconnaissance phase. But without more suspicious activities like network connections or unusual command lines, it's hard to say. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because while there are some suspicious elements, they might be part of normal operations. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events and temporary files could warrant further investigation.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a mix of common system processes like whoami.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe, notepad.exe, etc. Some of these are normal, but others like powershell.exe being accessed multiple times might be a red flag. However, just having powershell.exe isn't necessarily bad. The command line for whoami.exe seems normal, just the standard path.\n\nThen, there's a couple of entries where the image loaded is urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer and is used for handling URLs, but if it's being loaded by processes like calc.exe or Calculator.exe, that might be unusual. Typically, urlmon.dll is loaded by browsers or other applications that handle web content, but if it's being loaded by a calculator or other non-browser process, that could be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or a component of a malware.\n\nAlso, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file created is a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That might be part of a normal configuration update, but if it's unexpected or if there's no prior context, it could be something to investigate. However, without more info, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe registry events and process accesses are common in normal system operations, but repeated access to processes like powershell.exe and svchost.exe could be part of a larger pattern. However, the key thing here is the image load of urlmon.dll by non-browser processes. That seems suspicious. \n\nAnother point is the multiple DNS queries and network connections from chrome.exe. If chrome is making a lot of network connections, that's normal if the user is browsing, but if it's unexpected or to unusual domains, that's a problem. However, the events don't specify the domains or IPs involved, so I can't say for sure.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the loading of urlmon.dll by calc.exe and Calculator.exe. That's not typical and could indicate a malicious payload. However, I need to check if there's a legitimate reason for that. But in the absence of more context, this would be a point of interest.
