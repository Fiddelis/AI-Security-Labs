First, I need to look through all the events.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe has DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not suspicious. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is common, but when combined with other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a standard command to get user info, but again, not necessarily bad. However, the next entries show powershell.exe accessing the registry and loading various DLLs. Some of these DLLs are part of .NET Framework, which is normal, but others like MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a concern. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Microsoft Defender, so maybe that's legitimate. But why is it being loaded by PowerShell?\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute and then clean up. The file name is a PowerShell script, which might be part of an attack. Also, the command line in one of the powershell.exe entries has a suspicious script that modifies the LastWriteTime of a file. That could be an attempt to hide the file's creation time, which is a malicious behavior.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to say. The other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry are less concerning, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it adds up.\n\nSo, the key points are: multiple PowerShell processes, loading of DLLs, creation and deletion of temp files, and modifying file timestamps. These could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code, bypass security measures, or cover tracks. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temp directory, and loading of potential malicious DLLs (e.g., MpOAV.dll). Combined with script execution attempts that modify file timestamps, indicating possible evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, looking through the events, there's a bunch of PowerShell processes running with specific command lines. Each of them is using Get-ChildItem on various file paths and then setting the LastWriteTime to January 1, 1970. That date is a common Unix epoch time, which is often used in malware to mark files as old or to bypass time-based checks.\n\nHmm, modifying file timestamps could be part of an attack, like hiding the actual time files were created or modified. The fact that there are multiple instances of this with different file paths might indicate a pattern. The files mentioned are in directories with names like \"modulo_logico\", \"unidade_logico\", which might be part of a specific application or system structure. But the key thing is the modification of timestamps.\n\nAlso, there's a 'File created' event for a PowerShell startup profile and a Winlogbeat configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe someone is trying to configure it, but that's not necessarily malicious. However, the repeated PowerShell commands modifying timestamps could be suspicious. The other events involve svchost.exe and registry changes, but those are common in normal system operations. The calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal too, as that's part of Internet Explorer.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flag is the multiple PowerShell processes altering file timestamps to a specific date. That behavior is often seen in malicious activities, such as evading detection or tampering with evidence. The confidence is medium because while the actions are suspicious, they could be part of a legitimate script if not properly contextualized. But without more info, the repeated timestamp changes are enough to flag this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file LastWriteTime attributes to a specific date (1\/1\/1970), which is commonly used in malicious activity to obscure file timestamps. This pattern suggests potential tampering or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the Downloads directory, which might be normal, but I should note that. The other processes are mostly chrome.exe and powershell.exe with various registry events and image loads.\n\nNow, the registry value set events are common, but when they're associated with chrome.exe multiple times, that might be a red flag. However, Chrome does interact with the registry during normal operations. The ImageLoad events mention amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If Chrome is loading that, maybe it's part of a legitimate security check. But then again, sometimes malware might mimic legitimate files. However, the paths here look like standard Windows Defender paths, so that might be okay.\n\nAnother point is the powershell.exe processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common legitimate tool. The fact that it's creating a file named 'unidade_logico.txt' in the Downloads folder might be benign, but I should check if there's any unusual activity. However, there's no indication of malicious commands here just from the event data provided.\n\nThe chrome.exe process has a lot of registry events. While this could be normal, if there's a sudden spike in registry modifications by Chrome, that might be worth looking into. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple registry events might just be part of Chrome's normal functioning, especially if it's updating settings or configurations.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file could be part of a configuration change, which is normal if someone is setting up or updating the tool. But if this is unexpected, it might be worth checking. However, the event doesn't show any malicious activity here.\n\nPutting it all together, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The most suspicious parts are the multiple registry events by chrome.exe and the image loads, but the paths and processes involved are typically legitimate. There's no direct evidence of exploitation, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. Therefore, while there are some unusual events, they don't strongly indicate a security threat. The confidence is moderate, but leaning towards not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include common system behaviors (e.g., Chrome modifying registry values, PowerShell creating files) and legitimate processes (e.g., amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). No clear indicators of compromise, anomalous access patterns, or malicious payloads are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
