Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and processes being created. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to check user identity, so that's probably normal.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes creating a service called win32times with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a red flag. Creating a service with a non-existent script could be an attempt to execute malicious code or set up persistence.\n\nAnother event shows sc.exe creating the same service again, which reinforces that the attacker might be trying to establish a service for persistence. The use of sc create and then sc qc to query the service's configuration is typical in such attacks.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events involving services.exe, cmd.exe, and others. While registry changes can be normal, the repetition and combination with service creation might indicate tampering. Also, the image load events for urlmon.dll in calc.exe and Calculator.exeâ€”urlmon.dll is a legitimate DLL, but loading it from a process like calc.exe might be unusual if it's not part of normal operations. However, since the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location, it might be a false positive or a normal process.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory could be benign if it's part of a log file, but the .yml.new file might be a temporary file during configuration. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But given the other suspicious activities, this might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activities are the creation of a service with a non-existent script, repeated registry modifications, and the use of sc.exe. These are indicators of potential malicious activity aimed at persistence and execution. Even though some events are normal, the combination suggests something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of a service with a non-existent script (win32times), repeated registry modifications, and use of sc.exe to manipulate services, which are common indicators of malicious persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious patterns across all the events.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with various tasks. A lot of them are \"Registry value set\" events. That's common in normal operations, but maybe if there's an unusual number or specific keys being modified, it could be a red flag. However, just seeing multiple registry events might not be enough on its own.\n\nThen, there's an entry where chrome.exe loaded a DLL from C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading this DLL, that's normal because it's used for scanning. But I should check if the path is correct. The path here is System32, which is standard. However, another entry shows loading MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender Platform directory. That also seems legitimate. But maybe the presence of these DLLs being loaded by chrome.exe is normal, so not necessarily suspicious.\n\nLooking at the other processes: ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe also have registry events. Powershell.exe has a \"Process accessed\" event. While powershell is often used for legitimate tasks, it's also a common tool for attackers. However, without more context like command-line arguments or unusual network activity, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe key point here is that there's no clear indication of malicious activity. All the processes mentioned are common on Windows systems. The registry events are typical for various applications. The DLLs loaded by chrome.exe are from legitimate locations. There's no mention of unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or other signs of compromise. \n\nBut wait, the fact that chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll might be normal because Chrome uses Windows Defender for scanning. However, if these were from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. But in this case, the paths are correct. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the number of registry events for chrome.exe. There are 8 entries of \"Registry value set\" for chrome.exe. That's a lot, but maybe it's just a lot of normal operations. Without knowing what specific registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say. \n\nThe presence of multiple processes (like powershell.exe) having registry events could be part of normal operations. For example, powershell might be used to modify registry settings as part of a script. But again, without more context, it's hard to determine if that's malicious.\n\nOverall, the logs don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The events are all related to normal system operations, even though some processes are common in attacks. However, there's no specific evidence pointing to a security incident. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent common system behavior with no clear malicious indicators. Processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are legitimate, and registry modifications or DLL loads are consistent with normal operations. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
