So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's creating a scheduled task with schtasks. The command line here is important. It's setting up a task to run daily as the system user, and the trigger is a PowerShell script with -ep bypass. That's a red flag because -ep bypass is often used to bypass execution policies, which is common in attacks. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, but the file name has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a typo or a fake name. However, the fact that it's trying to run a script with bypass could be malicious.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe creating another task with a similar command line, pointing to c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the same pattern. The task names are \"win32times\" which sounds like a fake name, maybe trying to mimic a legitimate task. \n\nThen there's a file created event for svchost.exe under C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. That's a system directory, and creating a task there might be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, multiple registry value sets for svchost.exe and chrome.exe. But chrome.exe events are all registry changes, which might be normal, but repeated could be suspicious. However, the main issue is the scheduled tasks.\n\nThe other events involve winlogbeat and chrome, but those don't seem directly malicious. The key points are the scheduled tasks created with schtasks, using PowerShell with bypass, and the non-existing script names. Even if the scripts don't exist, the attempt to execute them is suspicious. Also, the tasks are set to run daily as the system user, which is a high-privilege account, indicating potential for persistence.\n\nSo putting it all together, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, using PowerShell with bypass, and the non-existent script names suggests a possible attack. Even if the scripts aren't found, the setup is concerning. Therefore, this batch is interesting and needs investigation. Confidence is high because these are common indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with elevated privileges (system user) using PowerShell with -ep bypass, which is commonly used in attacks to bypass execution policies. The tasks reference non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), suggesting potential malicious intent. Additionally, svchost.exe and schtasks.exe activities in system directories raise concerns about persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there's powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is, but PowerShell is common for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nNext, there are two instances of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. The third event mentions ProcessAccess with no file, and the fifth is another ProcessAccess. The fourth event is whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to check user privileges. That's usually benign.\n\nNow, looking for any suspicious patterns. The first event's file path is a .yml.new file, which might be a temporary file during configuration. The entrada_ativo.txt could be a log or data file. The ProcessAccess events might indicate someone checking the process, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Whoami.exe alone isn't suspicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities and file creations might be worth investigating. But since there's no clear indication of malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or unusual network activity, it's probably not a security threat. The events seem to be part of normal user activities or software setup. So I'd classify this as not interesting, but with moderate confidence because there's no obvious malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show standard file creation and process access activities without indicators of compromise. PowerShell usage and winlogbeat file creation are consistent with legitimate system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
