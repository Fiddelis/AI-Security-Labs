{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' activity. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. Let me check the specific events. \n\nThere are several 'Image loaded' events for 'mscoree.dll' and 'mscoreei.dll', which are part of the .NET framework. That might be normal, but then there's a load of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. Hmm, that's interesting because MpOAV is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. If an attacker is loading this DLL, maybe they're trying to bypass or interact with the antivirus?\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1'. The name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which might be part of a PowerShell script that's testing execution policies. But why in the Temp folder? That could be a sign of a script being generated on the fly, which is sometimes done by malware to avoid detection.\n\nOther events involve 'svchost.exe' creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That's where Windows Update stores files. Creating files there might be normal during updates, but if it's part of a malicious activity, like a rogue update or something, that's a red flag. Also, 'svchost.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll' could relate to Task Scheduler, which is sometimes used by malware to persist.\n\nThere are also registry value set events by 'svchost.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. Changing registry values could be part of configuring persistence or altering system settings to hide the attack.\n\nHowever, I need to check if all these activities are just normal system behavior. For example, 'svchost.exe' is a legitimate process that hosts various system services. The image loads for 'urlmon.dll' and 'BitsProxy.dll' are part of Windows' URL and Background Intelligent Transfer Service, which are normal. The 'sppsvc.exe' creating 'cache.dat' is related to Windows activation, which is legitimate.\n\nBut the combination of multiple PowerShell events, especially the creation of a script in Temp, loading of Defender's DLL, and the registry changes might indicate something. The presence of 'MpOAV.dll' being loaded by PowerShell could be an attempt to interact with the antivirus, maybe to disable it. Also, the file created by PowerShell in the user's AppData might be a script that's part of a larger attack.\n\nI should also consider the frequency. There are multiple events related to PowerShell, which could be normal if the user is running scripts, but without context, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of several suspicious file creations and image loads, along with registry changes, increases the likelihood of this being a security incident.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has several events that could indicate malicious activity, such as script creation in Temp, loading of security-related DLLs, and registry modifications. While some events are normal, the combination and the specific files involved make this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is around 0.7 because while not all events are malicious, the combination raises enough suspicion to warrant looking into it.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances loading suspicious DLLs (e.g., MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender) and creating temporary scripts, combined with svchost.exe activity in system directories, suggests potential malicious behavior or security tool interaction warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious. \n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of svchost.exe and MpSigStub.exe, which are legitimate Windows processes. But then there's setup.exe creating files like cookie_exporter.exe and elevated_tracing_service.exe. Hmm, those names sound a bit odd. Cookie exporter? Maybe that's part of some software installation, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, there's a powershell.exe event with a command line that creates a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it. The binary path is pointing to a file in C:\\unidade_logico... which doesn't look like a standard Windows directory. That seems suspicious. Creating a new service through PowerShell isn't necessarily bad, but the path is unusual. Also, the service name \"objeto_ativo\" might be a red herring or could be a foreign term, maybe Portuguese for \"active object,\" but that's just a guess.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events by svchost.exe. While svchost.exe is a normal process, too many registry changes might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The file creation events in SoftwareDistribution folders might be related to Windows Update, which is normal. But the other files created by setup.exe in Program Files (x86) under EdgeCore â€“ maybe that's part of an installation, but again, the names of the executables are a bit odd.\n\nThe PowerShell events loading mscoreei.dll and clr.dll are normal as they are part of .NET. However, the command line that creates the service is a big red flag. Unauthorized service creation can be a sign of malware trying to persist on the system. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations might be part of a larger attack.\n\nBut I should check if there are other indicators. The user might be installing something legitimate, but the combination of creating a service with a strange name and path, along with other events, raises concerns. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the suspicious service creation and unusual file paths are enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes PowerShell activity creating a new service with a non-standard name ('objeto_ativo') and an executable path in a suspicious directory ('C:\\\\unidade_logico...'), which may indicate unauthorized service creation.

Further investigation is warranted.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of events. First, I notice that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to look closer.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they mention image loaded events for mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are part of the .NET framework and Windows Defender, so those might be normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, which might be used for inter-process communication. Not sure yet, but not immediately malicious. Then, the events involving tarefa_logico.exe loading .NET DLLs. That's a bit odd because tarefa_logico.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe a custom application, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's an entry with a command line that imports a module from a non-standard path: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The path has \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_secundario\", which look like they could be part of a malicious script. The command also includes Invoke-entrada_principal and Start-Sleep, which might be part of a larger script that's trying to do something stealthy.\n\nAnother event shows a command to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe. Creating a service is a common technique for persistence. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" doesn't look like a standard service name either. This is a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities, creating and deleting files, loading suspicious DLLs, creating a new service. These are all indicators of potential malicious behavior. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these actions, especially the service creation and non-standard paths, makes me think this is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities involving suspicious file operations (create\/delete in Temp directory), non-standard module imports from 'unidade_logico' path, and creation of a new service ('objeto_ativo') with a custom executable. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries with the same command line in PowerShell. They're using New-Service and Start-Service to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe. That seems suspicious because creating a new service isn't a typical user action, and the path has some non-standard directory names like \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_comum\". Those might be obfuscation techniques to hide the actual malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are several entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The repetition of the same file path multiple times could indicate that this script is being executed repeatedly, possibly as part of a larger attack. The fact that the same command is repeated so many times might be an attempt to automate the execution or to overwhelm the system.\n\nLooking at the other entries, there's \"Security Group Management\" and some logon events with services.exe. While services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, if there are multiple logon events or if the service creation is tied to a remote command execution, that could be a red flag. However, the majority of the logs here are about executing the same remote command multiple times and creating a service with a suspicious path.\n\nI should also check for any patterns. The repeated execution of the same PowerShell script and the creation of a new service with a non-standard binary path are both indicators of potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell for creating services and executing remote commands is common in attacks, especially if done without proper authorization.\n\nThe confidence here is pretty high because the combination of creating a service with a non-standard path, repeated execution of the same remote command, and the use of PowerShell scripts that are not typically seen in normal operations points towards a possible security incident. However, I should consider that there might be legitimate reasons for these actions, but given the repetition and the obfuscation in the file paths, it's more likely to be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands create a suspicious service ('objeto_ativo') with a non-standard binary path, followed by repeated execution of a remote PowerShell script ('componente_auxiliar.ps1') from a suspicious directory.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided three log entries in JSONL format. Each entry has a process set to \"None\", a winlog task of \"Execute a Remote Command\", and a file path pointing to the same PowerShell script on a Windows system.\n\nFirst, I need to check if these events are suspicious. The task \"Execute a Remote Command\" sounds like a potential indicator of compromise, especially if it's happening repeatedly. But the process is \"None\", which might mean that the event was logged without an associated process, or maybe it's a system-level event. However, PowerShell scripts are often used in attacks, especially if they're executing remote commands. \n\nThe same file path is mentioned three times. If this script is being executed multiple times from the same location, that could be a sign of ongoing activity. But I should consider if this is normal behavior. For example, some legitimate tasks might involve remote execution. However, the repetition might be a red flag. \n\nAlso, the lack of a specific process might indicate that the event isn't being tracked properly, or maybe it's a system event that's not tied to a user process. But in security terms, if the same file is being executed multiple times with the same task, that's suspicious. \n\nI need to check if there's any other information missing. The user only provided these three events. Without more context, like user accounts involved, IP addresses, or other processes, it's harder to be certain. But the repetition of the same event three times with the same parameters is a strong indicator that something might be wrong. \n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because multiple identical events involving executing a remote command from the same file path could indicate a potential security threat. The confidence is high because of the repetition and the nature of the task.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events show execution of a remote command from the same suspicious PowerShell script path, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
