So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell commands that create scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, triggering at logon, and setting the principal to Administrators with high run level. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges can be part of persistence mechanisms. The task names like \"unidade_ativo\" or \"tarefa_base\" might be obfuscated or part of a larger plan.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about PowerShell processes, including image loads of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are typical for PowerShell runs, but the repeated image loads might indicate something is trying to execute .NET code, which could be malicious. Also, the file creation in the Temp directory with a .ps1 script could be a script being dropped, which is common in attacks.\n\nOther events include registry value set, process accessed, and pipe created. These might be part of the malware's behavior, trying to modify settings or communicate. The combination of scheduled tasks, .NET assemblies, and temporary script creation suggests an attempt to establish persistence and execute code under admin rights.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign activity. For example, the Chrome.exe pipe created might be normal, but since most events are related to PowerShell and scheduled tasks, it's more likely malicious. The confidence is high because multiple suspicious activities are present, but not 100% certain without more context. So classification is INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges to execute calc.exe at logon, which is suspicious. Additional events show .NET DLLs being loaded and a temporary PowerShell script created, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these events step by step. The first event shows a PowerShell script deleting a temporary file. That's normal, maybe part of cleanup. But then there's another PowerShell process with a command line that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe with high privileges for Administrators. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be a way to maintain persistence. \n\nNext, there are multiple entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks. That's a red flag because executing remote commands can indicate unauthorized access or command and control traffic. Then, there's another PowerShell command creating another scheduled task named \"unidade_comum\". Both tasks are using the ScheduledTask module, which is a common technique in attacks to set up persistence.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll is normal, but the repeated Registry value sets by Chrome and PowerShell might indicate attempts to modify registry keys for persistence or evasion. The Chrome processes loading amsi.dll could be related to bypassing detection, as AMSI is used for scanning scripts.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat file creation, which might be part of log collection, but the user-created files like entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt could be placeholders or malicious scripts. The high number of RegistryEvent and FileCreate events, combined with the scheduled tasks, suggests someone is trying to modify the system's configuration and leave backdoors.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, multiple remote command executions, and unusual file creations and registry changes points towards a potential security threat. Even though some events are normal, the combination and frequency of these suspicious activities make this batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges (e.g., 'Register-ScheduledTask estrutura_auxiliar' and 'unidade_comum'), combined with repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events and suspicious file operations in temporary directories, indicate potential persistence mechanisms or command-and-control activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
