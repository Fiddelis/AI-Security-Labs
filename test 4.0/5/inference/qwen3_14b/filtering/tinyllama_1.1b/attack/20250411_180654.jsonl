{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe, but no file mentioned. Maybe just a process access, not sure.\n\nNext, several events from chrome.exe with Registry value set. Multiple times, but chrome accessing the registry isn't necessarily bad. Unless it's modifying specific keys, but the data here is limited.\n\nThen, looking at the event with command_line: powershell.exe running Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That script name sounds suspicious. Get-Keystrokes.ps1 might be related to keylogging, which is malicious. The fact that it's being executed multiple times with different paths suggests an attempt to log keystrokes, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating and deleting temporary files is common, but when combined with the keystroke logging script, it could be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nThe Image loaded events for clr.dll, MpOAV.dll, and MpClient.dll are legitimate system files, so those might be normal. However, the presence of the keystroke logging script is concerning.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths suggests an attempt to evade detection by changing locations each time.\n\nPutting this all together: the presence of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being executed multiple times by powershell.exe, along with the creation of temporary files in the TEMP directory, indicates potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these specific PowerShell commands and the keystroke logging script is highly suspicious. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directories, indicating potential keystroke logging malware. Combined with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and repeated execution patterns, this suggests malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}

Let's go through each line one by one.\n\nFirst event: The process is powershell.exe executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is designed to capture keystrokes and save them to a log file in the TEMP directory. The command line looks suspicious because it's using PowerShell to run a script that's likely malicious. The winlog task is 'Engine Lifecycle', which might not be directly relevant. The file is None here, but the process itself is a red flag.\n\nSecond event: The winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path points to another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in a different location. This script is known for keystroke logging, which is a common malware technique. The process is None here, but the file path is significant. This seems like part of the same malicious activity, maybe the script was downloaded or executed remotely.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe is creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, so this might be normal. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which could be user-initiated. Not obviously malicious, but needs to be checked in context.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe is creating a file called pacote_temporario.txt. This could be benign, but combined with the previous events, it's possible that this is part of the same attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the script is generating some temporary files.\n\nFifth event: svchost.exe is creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, and the file path here seems related to system services. This might be normal, but sometimes malware uses svchost to hide its activities. However, the filename here is keyValueLKG.dat, which doesn't immediately look like a keystroke log.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two events involve the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script, which is a known malicious script for keylogging. The presence of this script being executed and created in different locations is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The other events involve legitimate processes and files, but the first two are clearly suspicious. Even though there are other events, the presence of the keystroke logging script is enough to flag this batch as interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because keylogging is a clear sign of a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' (a known keystroke logging script) and its associated file creation events, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
