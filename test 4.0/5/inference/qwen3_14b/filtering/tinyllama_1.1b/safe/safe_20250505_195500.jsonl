So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created or images loaded. The processes involved are SDXHelper.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The files created are all JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Now, SDXHelper.exe â€“ I'm not too familiar with that, but maybe it's part of some Office add-in or tool? The file paths look like they're part of Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages, which might be related to some kind of package or add-on.\n\nWait, but there are multiple entries where SDXHelper.exe creates these JS files. Now, JavaScript files in that directory could be part of legitimate Office operations, but sometimes malicious software uses similar paths. However, I don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity here. The filenames are all minified JS, which is common in legitimate software too. Also, svchost.exe and chrome.exe are standard processes, so their activities here seem normal.\n\nThere's also an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file makes sense. The user might be setting up or testing it. \n\nThe only odd one out is the event with process null and the task \"Security Group Management.\" That's a bit unclear. Maybe it's a system event that doesn't involve a specific process. But without more context, it's hard to say if that's suspicious.\n\nOverall, the majority of events don't show signs of malware or unauthorized activity. The files created are in expected locations for Office packages, and the processes involved are legitimate. However, the repeated creation of JS files by SDXHelper.exe might warrant further investigation if there's any reason to suspect that process. But based on the information given, there's no clear evidence of a security threat. So, maybe this isn't a high priority for investigation unless there's additional context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not indicate clear evidence of malicious activity or security threats. Here's a structured assessment:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes and File Paths:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is creating JavaScript (`.min.js`) files in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory. These files are likely part of legitimate Office add-ins, language packs, or localized resources (common in software localization).\n   - **svchost.exe** and **chrome.exe** are standard Windows and browser processes, respectively, and their activities (e.g., file creation) align with normal operations.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat.exe Activity:**\n   - The creation of a `.yml.new` file by **winlogbeat.exe** is consistent with configuring or testing a log shipper tool, which is a legitimate administrative task.\n\n3. **Ambiguous Event:**\n   - The event with **`process: null`** and **`Security Group Management`** task lacks context but does not inherently indicate a threat. It may relate to system-level group policy or authentication events.\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **SDXHelper.exe Repeated File Creation:** While not inherently suspicious, the frequent generation of `.min.js` files by an uncommon process (SDXHelper.exe) could warrant further investigation if there is a lack of transparency about the tool's purpose or if it is not part of a known Microsoft Office component.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **No immediate security threat** is evident in the logs. The activities observed are consistent with legitimate software operations (e.g., Office localization, log shipping).\n- **Further investigation** may be warranted if SDXHelper.exe is not a recognized component of the user's environment or if there are additional contextual indicators (e.g., unusual network activity, user behavior).\n\n**Recommendation:** Monitor SDXHelper.exe's behavior and ensure it aligns with expected system tools. No urgent action is required based on the provided data."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to file creation, specifically under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\". The files being created have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js\". There's a lot of repetition here, with some files being created multiple times. \n\nThen there are a couple of events involving \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values. But the majority are from \"SDXHelper.exe\". Now, SDXHelper isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Typically, legitimate processes have well-known names, so an unfamiliar one might be a red flag. \n\nThe fact that so many files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory is concerning. Microsoft Office usually doesn't generate a lot of JavaScript files in that location, especially not with such repetitive naming. This could indicate some kind of malicious activity, like a dropper or a downloader that's creating files to execute later. \n\nAlso, the repeated creation of the same files might suggest that there's an attempt to overwrite or repeatedly deploy something. However, since there's no mention of execution events (like process starts or script executions), it's possible that this is just part of a larger attack chain. \n\nThe registry events from Chrome might be unrelated, but they could also be part of a broader compromise. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The key point here is the unusual number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard directory. \n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of legitimate software doing this. For example, some development tools or Office add-ins might generate files, but the naming pattern here seems too systematic. The hash-like suffixes in the filenames (\"min_xxxxx.js\") might be indicative of some automated process, but again, not something standard. \n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple file creations could be a sign of a malware dropper that's staging files before executing them. Since there's no execution event here, it's possible that the next step is to look for other events that might indicate execution, but based on the data given, the file creation alone is suspicious. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the high volume of file creations by an uncommon process in a sensitive directory, along with the repetitive filenames, points towards a potential security incident. Therefore, this batch of events is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided batch of system events warrants investigation due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Unusual File Creation Activity**:\n   - **High Volume**: Over 20 files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` are created in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`. This is highly unusual for standard Office operations.\n   - **Repetition**: Some files (e.g., `min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js`) are created multiple times, suggesting potential overwriting or redundant deployment.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process Involvement**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`**: This process is not a recognized Microsoft Office component. Its role in creating numerous JavaScript files in a sensitive directory raises concerns about potential malicious activity (e.g., staging payloads or obfuscating code).\n\n3. **Location and Context**:\n   - The `SolutionPackages` directory is typically used for Office add-ins or extensions. The presence of JavaScript files with hash-like suffixes here may indicate an attempt to bypass detection or inject malicious code.\n\n4. **Registry Events**:\n   - While the `chrome.exe` registry events alone are not alarming, they could be part of a broader compromise if correlated with other suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Hypotheses**\n- **Malware Dropper\/Downloader**: The repeated file creation could be part of a dropper stage, preparing files for execution.\n- **Code Injection or Obfuscation**: The JavaScript files might be used to execute malicious code or bypass security controls.\n- **Compromise of Office Environment**: The use of a non-standard process in a trusted directory (e.g., `SolutionPackages`) suggests a potential compromise of the system or Office application.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - Check if the process is legitimate (e.g., via file reputation, digital signatures, or behavioral analysis).\n   - Monitor for additional activity (e.g., network connections, execution of the created files).\n\n2. **Analyze the Created Files**:\n   - Use sandboxing or static analysis to inspect the contents of the JavaScript files for malicious payloads (e.g., obfuscated code, URLs, or command-and-control references).\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Events**:\n   - Look for execution events (e.g., `Process Creation` logs) related to the created files or `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Check for network traffic originating from the system that might indicate communication with malicious servers.\n\n4. **System Hardening**:\n   - Restrict write access to sensitive directories like `SolutionPackages`.\n   - Implement application control policies to block untrusted executables (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events suggest a potential security incident involving anomalous file creation by an untrusted process in a sensitive directory. Immediate investigation is recommended to determine if this represents a malware infection, insider threat, or misconfiguration."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these log entries. All of them are about files being created by the process named SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files (since they end with .js) and they're located in the Office package resources under a specific directory. The filenames have a pattern with a lot of alphanumeric characters, which seems random. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Office applications sometimes use temporary files or resources, but creating so many files with random names might be suspicious. However, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. \n\nSDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the setup or installation process. It might be involved in deploying updates or resources. But creating a large number of JavaScript files in the resources directory could be part of a legitimate update, or it could be malware disguising itself as a legitimate process.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of some filenames. For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05.js appears twice. This might indicate that the process is writing the same file multiple times, which could be normal if it's overwriting or duplicating files, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity like data exfiltration or creating backdoors.\n\nI should also check the timestamps of these files. If they were all created in a short period, that might be more concerning. However, since I don't have access to the actual timestamps here, I'll have to rely on the structure of the logs.\n\nAnother angle: the files are named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which might be part of a legitimate localization or resource file. However, the random string after the hyphen could be a hash or identifier, which is common in legitimate software for versioning. Still, the sheer number of files might be unusual.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. If the user is running a legitimate Office update, this could be normal. However, if there's no recent Office update or installation, this activity might be suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, the creation of numerous JavaScript files with random names in the Office resources directory could be either normal or malicious. Further investigation would be needed, such as checking the digital signatures of the files, examining the process's behavior with a security tool, or looking for other signs of malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is creating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_XXXXX.js`) in the **Microsoft Office** resources directory. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Files**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft Office process, often associated with **installation, updates, or resource management**.\n   - The files created are `.js` files with names containing random alphanumeric strings (e.g., `min_6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05.js`), which may represent **localized resources, temporary files, or version-specific assets**.\n\n2. **File Repetition**:\n   - Some filenames (e.g., `min_6dade363082f1b2eb407f27c005c3e05.js`) appear **multiple times**, suggesting **redundant writes** or **duplicate entries**. This could be normal (e.g., during updates) or suspicious (e.g., malware hiding in plain sight).\n\n3. **Location**:\n   - The files are stored in a **Microsoft Office-specific directory** (`%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`), which is **expected** for Office-related processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n1. **Legitimate Office Activity**:\n   - **Updates\/patches**: Office updates often involve creating temporary or resource files.\n   - **Localization**: The `.js` files could be part of **language-specific resources** (e.g., for UI strings).\n   - **Cache\/Temporary Files**: SDXHelper might be managing temporary files during operations.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity (Potential Red Flags)**:\n   - **Unusual Volume**: Creating **16+ files** with random names in a short period might be **uncharacteristic** for legitimate Office processes.\n   - **File Duplication**: Repeating the same filename could indicate **malware obfuscation** or **data exfiltration**.\n   - **Lack of Clear Purpose**: The filenames lack obvious context (e.g., \"update\", \"install\"), making their purpose ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Check File Signatures**:\n   - Verify the **digital signatures** of the files. Legitimate Office files should be signed by Microsoft.\n\n2. **Monitor Process Behavior**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor (ProcMon)** or **Wireshark** to track **file operations, network activity**, and **registry changes** by SDXHelper.exe.\n\n3. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a **full system scan** with updated antivirus\/malware tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes) to rule out infections.\n\n4. **Check for Recent Office Updates**:\n   - If the user recently installed an **Office update or patch**, this activity could be normal.\n\n5. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Inspect the contents of the `.js` files (if safe) to determine if they contain **Office-related code** or **obfuscated malicious payloads**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate process, the **creation of numerous JavaScript files with random names** could indicate either **normal Office activity** or **malicious behavior**. Further investigation is required to confirm the legitimacy of these files. If the user is not performing an Office update or installation, this activity should be treated as **potentially suspicious**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. There are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office Package Resources directory. The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash and \".js\". \n\nFirst, I notice that some files are created multiple times. For example, the file with hash \"a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js\" appears twice, same with \"a97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js\". That might be a red flag because it's unusual for the same file to be created more than once unless it's part of a normal process, but I'm not sure.\n\nNext, the names of the files are all minified JavaScript files. The term \"aicopilot\" could be a typo or a specific term. Wait, maybe \"aicopilot\" is a misspelling of \"AI copilot\"? Like the AI assistant feature in some software? If that's the case, these files might be related to an AI copilot feature in Office. But then why are they being created in the Package Resources directory? That's typically where temporary or cached files are stored, but maybe it's part of an update or installation process.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of files being created (over 15 entries) might be excessive. Even if it's part of a legitimate process, creating so many files in a short period could be suspicious. Also, SDXHelper.exe is not a well-known process. I should check if this is a legitimate Microsoft process. A quick search in my mind: Microsoft Office does have some helper processes, but SDXHelper.exe isn't one I recall. It might be a third-party application or even malware.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the path. The files are in the \"Package Resources\" directory under the Office installation folder. If this is part of a legitimate update, there might be a corresponding installer or update process. But without any other logs indicating an installation or update, this could be a sign of something malicious. Malware often creates numerous files in temporary directories or within application folders to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the fact that the same files are created multiple times might indicate that the process is either failing or trying to overwrite files, which is not typical for legitimate software. It could be a sign of a worm or other malware that's replicating files.\n\nI should also think about the hashes. The hashes are unique for each file, but that's normal for minified JS files. However, if these files are being generated dynamically, that might be a concern. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn summary, while it's possible that this is part of a legitimate process (like an AI feature update), the combination of the unusual process name, the large number of files created, and the repetition of some files makes this look suspicious. It would be worth checking if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, and if not, further investigation would be necessary to determine if it's malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process is creating numerous minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the Microsoft Office Package Resources directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual File Creation:**\n   - Over **15 files** are created in quick succession, all named similarly (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`). This pattern is highly unusual for standard software behavior, which typically does not generate such a large number of files in a short time.\n\n2. **Repetition of Files:**\n   - Some files (e.g., `a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js`, `a97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js`) are created **twice**. This redundancy could indicate a failure in the process or an attempt to overwrite files, which is not typical for legitimate software.\n\n3. **Suspicious Process Name:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is **not a known Microsoft Office process**. While Microsoft uses helper processes, this name does not align with any standard Office-related executables. It may be a third-party application or potentially **malware**.\n\n4. **File Location and Purpose:**\n   - The files are stored in the `Package Resources` directory, which is typically used for temporary or cached files. However, the creation of **numerous minified JS files** in this location could indicate an attempt to inject malicious code or perform unauthorized operations.\n\n5. **Potential Malware Indicators:**\n   - The behavior resembles tactics used by malware, such as:\n     - **File proliferation** to avoid detection.\n     - **Dynamic file generation** (via hashes) to obfuscate malicious activity.\n     - **Unusual process names** to mimic legitimate processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\...\\SDXHelper.exe` vs. temporary directories). Legitimate processes are typically found in standard installation folders.\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to scan for malware.\n\n2. **Investigate Further:**\n   - Check for **unauthorized network activity** or **unusual system performance** (e.g., high CPU usage by `SDXHelper.exe`).\n   - Monitor the **creation of additional files** in the `Package Resources` directory.\n\n3. **Consider the Context:**\n   - If this is part of a **recent Office update or third-party software installation**, temporarily disable the process and observe if the files are deleted or if the system behaves normally.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs could theoretically represent a legitimate process (e.g., an AI feature update), the **unusual file creation volume, repetition, and lack of a known process name** strongly suggest **malicious activity**. Further investigation and malware scanning are recommended."}

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. The paths are all under the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder. There are multiple entries for the same files being created, which might be duplicates or just multiple events for the same file. \n\nThen there are some events related to chrome.exe. One event is a registry value set, and another is image loaded, pointing to MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Those DLLs are part of Microsoft Defender, so loading them is normal. The registry events for chrome.exe might be part of normal operations, but I need to check if they're suspicious.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It's possible that this is part of a software installation or update, but the repeated creation of JavaScript files in the Office directory could be unusual. However, the files are named in a way that suggests they might be part of an application's resources, maybe for localization (since \"strings\" is common in localization files). But the hashes in the filenames are a bit suspicious. If these files are legitimate, they might be part of a package, but if not, they could be malicious.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple file creation events for the same files might indicate that the process is writing the same files multiple times, which could be a sign of something trying to overwrite or install something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, the presence of chrome.exe interacting with the registry and loading Defender DLLs doesn't seem harmful, but it's worth noting.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. If it's part of a software like Microsoft Office or another legitimate application, then this might be normal. However, if it's not known, that's a red flag. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to assume that SDXHelper.exe might be suspicious here.\n\nAnother thing is that all the files are JavaScript, which is more common for web applications, but in the context of Office, maybe they're part of an add-in or something similar. However, the hashes in the filenames don't match typical naming conventions for legitimate files. \n\nPutting it all together, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location (AppData) with unusual filenames could be indicative of malicious activity. However, without more information, it's a bit ambiguous. The chrome.exe events don't seem suspicious, but the SDXHelper activity is worth investigating further. Therefore, the batch of events is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the following observations:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activity:**\n1. **Repeated File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Location:** Files are created in a non-standard path:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`  \n     This is unusual for typical application behavior and may indicate tampering or unauthorized activity.\n   - **File Names:** JavaScript files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` (e.g., `min_eaf004e5319b47ef0404822a78e7075c.js`).  \n     - The use of hashes in filenames suggests obfuscation or generation of unique files, which is common in malicious payloads (e.g., droppers, scripts).  \n     - The `officeaicopilot` prefix could hint at a connection to Microsoft Office, but the context is unclear.\n\n2. **Multiple Writes to the Same Files:**  \n   - The same files (e.g., `min_e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182.js`) are written multiple times. This could indicate an attempt to overwrite or install content, possibly malicious.\n\n3. **`SDXHelper.exe` as a Potential Threat:**  \n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process. Its presence and behavior (writing files in sensitive directories) warrant scrutiny.  \n   - No clear legitimate purpose is evident from the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious but Noteworthy Activity:**\n- **`chrome.exe` Interactions:**  \n  - **Registry writes** and **loading of Defender DLLs** (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are normal for Chrome and Windows Defender.  \n  - These events are not inherently malicious but may indicate Chrome extensions or user activity requiring Defender scanning.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe repeated, obfuscated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` in a non-standard location is **highly suspicious** and warrants further investigation. While the Chrome-related events are benign, the `SDXHelper.exe` activity could indicate malware, a compromised system, or an unauthorized process.  \n\n**Action Recommended:**  \n- Check the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., verify its digital signature, file path, and parent process).  \n- Analyze the contents of the created JavaScript files for malicious payloads (e.g., embedded scripts, URLs, or obfuscated code).  \n- Monitor for additional suspicious behavior (e.g., network connections, registry modifications).  \n\nThis batch of events is **interesting enough to investigate further**."}

The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks like part of Microsoft Office's local storage, maybe for add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple JS files there, especially with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min... could be part of a legitimate Office add-in, but sometimes malicious software uses similar paths. However, I need more context.\n\nThen there are several entries from chrome.exe. One is creating a file stream for a downloaded Excel file, which seems normal. But there's also a Zone.Identifier file created, which is typically used by Windows to mark files as downloaded, so that's probably just the browser handling the file. The registry value set events might be normal too, unless they're modifying critical keys, but the log doesn't specify which registry keys.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe entries again, there are multiple files created in the same directory. The names are all JS files with different hashes. If these are part of a legitimate Office package, they might be resource files. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a short time could be a red flag. But without knowing the normal behavior of SDXHelper.exe, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the EXCEL.EXE entries. It's loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, and urlmon.dll. These are legitimate system files. However, there's also a file created in the Downloads directory named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx, which is a temporary file created by Excel when a file is opened. That seems normal.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned the classification should be based on the entire batch. Are there any unusual patterns? The SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files in the Office directory might be related to an add-in, but if those files are not part of a known Office package, they could be malicious. However, the logs don't provide the content of the files or any other indicators like network activity or unusual process behavior.\n\nAlso, the presence of both chrome.exe and EXCEL.EXE doing normal activities might not be suspicious. The only possible red flag is the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe, but without more context, it's hard to confirm. Maybe the system administrator should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process and if those JS files are part of a known Office add-in. But based solely on the logs provided, there's not enough evidence to classify this as definitely malicious. However, the repeated file creation in a specific directory by a single process might warrant further investigation. So maybe the answer is that it's interesting but not clearly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a mix of normal system and application activities, but there are a few patterns that could warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:  \n   - Multiple JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min...`) are created in the `Microsoft Office` local storage directory (`%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`). While this could be part of a legitimate Office add-in or solution, the repetitive creation of files with obfuscated names (e.g., hashes in filenames) raises suspicion. Malicious software sometimes uses similar tactics to hide payloads or mimic legitimate processes.\n\n2. **Excel.EXE and DLL Loading**:  \n   - `EXCEL.EXE` loads standard system DLLs (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, `urlmon.dll`), which is normal behavior. However, the presence of a temporary file (`~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) in the Downloads directory suggests Excel was actively used, which could be benign but should be cross-checked against user activity.\n\n3. **Chrome.EXE and File Streams**:  \n   - Chrome's interaction with the downloaded Excel file (e.g., `~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) and registry modifications are typical for file handling and browser operations. No obvious malicious activity is evident here.\n\n4. **Lack of Context**:  \n   - The logs do not include details about the content of the created files, network activity, or process parentage. Without additional context (e.g., whether `SDXHelper.exe` is a known legitimate process or if the JS files are part of a signed add-in), it is challenging to definitively classify this as malicious.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe logs are **potentially interesting** due to the unusual file-creation pattern by `SDXHelper.exe`, but no clear indicators of compromise (IoCs) are present. Further investigation (e.g., checking the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`, analyzing the JS files, and correlating with other logs) is recommended to rule out malicious activity.  \n\n**Classification**: **Interesting (needs further analysis)**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: Excel.exe is deleting a file named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign in the filename suggest it's a temporary file or a recovery file from Excel. That's normal, maybe when saving or closing a document. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a standard Windows process, and registry changes can be normal, but if there are a lot of them, it might be worth checking. However, in this case, there are only a couple of entries, and no specific suspicious keys mentioned. Maybe part of normal system operations.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, so creating files there might be part of normal package installation or updates. The filenames seem to be UI string files, which are part of the Office application resources. Not obviously malicious, but could be something to note.\n\nThen Excel.exe is creating a file stream in a temporary directory, which is common when working with Excel files. The Zone.Identifier part is a Windows feature that marks files downloaded from the internet, so that's normal too.\n\nThere's an image loaded event for coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL. Both are legitimate Windows and Office components. Loading these DLLs is standard for Excel to function properly.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) is part of its normal operation when setting up. Not suspicious here.\n\nLooking again at the Excel events, there are multiple registry value set events. Excel might be writing settings or temporary data to the registry, which is normal during its operation. However, the repetition of these events might indicate some automated process or script, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority of them are related to Excel and Office processes performing normal operations like file creation, deletion, and registry changes. SDXHelper and svchost are standard processes. The only thing that stands out is the deletion of the temporary Excel file, but that's typical. No unusual processes, no access to suspicious locations, no network activity mentioned. The files created are in expected directories for Office applications.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple registry changes by Excel could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys, but the logs don't specify which keys. Without more details, it's hard to confirm. But given the information, the events seem to be part of normal Excel usage. Therefore, maybe this isn't a high priority for investigation unless there's additional context or other indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries primarily reflect normal operations of Microsoft Office applications (specifically Excel) and system processes. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Excel-Related Activity:**\n   - **File Deletion:** `~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` (a temporary\/recovery file) is deleted. This is typical during Excel document saving\/closing.\n   - **File Creation:** Temporary files (e.g., `.LNK`, `.tmp`) and registry modifications are standard during Excel's operation (e.g., updating recent files, temporary settings).\n   - **Registry Changes:** Repeated `Registry value set` events by Excel are likely due to internal state management (e.g., tracking open files, UI settings).\n\n2. **System Processes:**\n   - **`svchost.exe` and `SDXHelper.exe`:** These are legitimate Windows and Office-related processes. Their activities (registry updates, file creation) align with expected behavior for system and application management.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat:** A file (`*.yml.new`) is created in the Downloads directory, which is typical during configuration setup for log shippers.\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators (if any):**\n- **No Unusual Processes:** All processes (`Excel`, `svchost`, `SDXHelper`, `winlogbeat`) are legitimate.\n- **No Malicious File Paths:** Files are created in standard directories (e.g., `AppData`, `Recent`, `SolutionPackages`), not in suspicious locations (e.g., `Temp`, `Downloads` for unknown files).\n- **No Network Activity:** No logs indicate network communication, which is common for benign activity but could be a gap if malware is involved.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events appear to be **normal operational activity** related to Excel and system processes. There is **no clear evidence of malicious behavior** in the provided logs. However, **further investigation** would be warranted if:\n- Additional logs (e.g., network activity, process creation, PowerShell\/cmd usage) indicate anomalous behavior.\n- The same processes exhibit unusual behavior in other contexts (e.g., unauthorized access, data exfiltration).\n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not suspicious** based on the provided data."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by scanning through the entries.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of events where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". There are nine of these. Then, there are some entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\". Then, there are several entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nHmm. So, the first thing I notice is that Excel is modifying the registry multiple times. That's a bit unusual because Excel typically doesn't need to set registry values unless it's part of some add-in or macro. But modifying the registry can be a sign of malicious activity, like changing settings to persist or disable security features.\n\nThen, there's SDXHelper.exe creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages folder. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office add-ins or solutions. The files created have names like \"office_2e97d65336bd5d3533e966e9de09077e.js\" and similar. These could be part of a legitimate add-in, but the repetition and the number of files might be suspicious. Also, the paths are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory, which is a common place for Office add-ins, but sometimes malware also uses these paths.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. So, combining these events. Excel modifying the registry multiple times and SDXHelper creating multiple JavaScript files. If these are all part of a legitimate Office add-in, maybe it's normal. But if the registry changes are not expected, or if the files created are not part of any known add-in, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother point: there are entries with process null and task None. That might indicate incomplete or malformed logs, but not necessarily malicious. However, if there's a lack of process information, it's harder to trace the activity.\n\nAlso, looking at the file names, they have long, random-looking hashes in them. That's common in some malicious payloads to avoid detection. But it's also used in legitimate software for unique identifiers. Still, combined with the registry changes, it's a bit concerning.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to add-ins. However, if it's creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages folder, maybe it's related to an add-in that's being deployed or updated. But the number of files here seems high. Also, the fact that Excel is modifying the registry could be part of configuring the add-in, but multiple changes might be overkill.\n\nBut without more context, like the user's environment or known good vs bad behavior, it's tricky. However, the combination of multiple registry writes by Excel and numerous file creations by SDXHelper in a non-standard way might be indicative of something suspicious. It's not definitive, but enough to warrant further investigation. Hence, classifying this as interesting for investigation makes sense.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of activities that could be benign or suspicious, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repeated Registry Modifications by Excel**:\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE`** performing **\"Registry value set\"** actions **9 times**. While Excel can legitimately interact with the registry (e.g., for add-ins or configuration), **repeated or unusual modifications** may indicate:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., disabling security features).\n     - **Malware** attempting to alter system behavior.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe Creating JavaScript Files**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** (associated with Microsoft Office add-ins) creates **multiple JavaScript files** in the **`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`** directory. These files:\n     - Have **obfuscated\/hashed names** (e.g., `office_2e97d65336bd5d3533e966e9de09077e.js`), common in **malware** to evade detection.\n     - Are stored in a **legitimate Office directory**, but **excessive file creation** here could indicate **unauthorized add-in deployment** or **malicious payload delivery**.\n\n3. **Anomalies in Log Entries**:\n   - **`Process: null`** and **`Task: None`** entries suggest **incomplete or malformed logs**, which could mask malicious activity or indicate **system instability**.\n\n### Risk Indicators:\n- **Unusual Volume of Activity**: 9 registry changes by Excel and 12+ file creations by SDXHelper in a short timeframe.\n- **Suspicious File Naming**: Hashed filenames are often used in **malware** to avoid signature-based detection.\n- **Lack of Context**: No clear indication of user-initiated actions (e.g., installing an add-in) to justify these changes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Interesting for Investigation**  \nWhile some activities (e.g., SDXHelper creating files) may be **legitimate** for Office add-ins, the **combination of repeated registry modifications by Excel** and **unusual file creation patterns** raises **red flags**. Further analysis (e.g., checking file contents, correlating with user behavior, and verifying add-in legitimacy) is required to determine if this is **malicious activity** or a **false positive**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like da-dk, de-de, el-gr, etc. \n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So maybe these are normal language packs or updates being installed. The fact that they're in the SolutionPackages folder under AppData suggests they might be part of Office's resource files.\n\nBut wait, the user might be concerned if this is normal or if it's malicious. Let me think. If this was a malware, you'd expect more variation in the file names, maybe some unusual extensions or paths. But here, all the files are .js, which is common for scripts in Office. Also, the process name is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate.\n\nHowever, there's a repetition in the file names. For example, the eu-es-ui-strings-json file appears twice. But that could just be a duplicate entry in the logs. Also, the package IDs like 36f79ca6696ef1e44a38fe2 and f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2 might be unique identifiers for different packages, which is normal.\n\nI should check if creating multiple .js files in that directory is typical. From what I remember, Office might generate or update these files as part of its normal operations, especially when handling different languages. The presence of multiple language codes suggests that the user might be using Office in a multilingual environment or installing language packs.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any sign of suspicious activity. All events are from the same process, and the files are in a standard location. No unusual command-line arguments or unexpected parent processes are mentioned here. The timestamps aren't provided, but if these events were all clustered in a short time, that might be a red flag. However, without that info, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information given, this seems to be legitimate activity related to Office's language resources. Unless there's additional context indicating otherwise, like other suspicious processes or network activity, this is probably normal.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the creation of multiple `.js` files by **SDXHelper.exe** in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and Location:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate component of **Microsoft Office**, associated with the **Office Deployment Tool** or **Click-to-Run** installations. It handles updates, language packs, and resource files.\n   - The files are stored in the **`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`** directory, a standard location for Office-related temporary or language-specific resources.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern:**\n   - Files are named with language codes (e.g., `da-dk`, `fr-ca`, `eu-es`) and include terms like `ui-strings-json`, suggesting they are **language-specific UI resource files** (likely JSON scripts for localization).\n   - The repetition of the same file (e.g., `eu-es-ui-strings-json_a2e18453e21d34b5fedf0f74fed2ebd7.js` appearing twice) may indicate **duplicate logging** or **redundant operations**, but not necessarily malicious activity.\n\n3. **No Immediate Red Flags:**\n   - **No unusual file extensions** (all `.js` files are standard for scripts).\n   - **No suspicious paths** or command-line arguments (not shown in the logs).\n   - **No indication of malware** (e.g., unexpected network activity, process injection, or hidden files).\n\n### **Possible Explanations:**\n- **Office Language Pack Installation\/Update:** The files may be part of a **language pack** or **UI update** for Office, especially if the user is multilingual or has recently installed\/activated new language resources.\n- **Click-to-Run Updates:** SDXHelper.exe is often involved in **Office Click-to-Run** operations, which may generate temporary files during updates or repairs.\n- **Legitimate Resource Generation:** The files could be **localized resources** (e.g., UI strings for different languages) used by Office applications.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity appears to be **legitimate** and likely related to **Office's normal operations**, such as language pack management or updates. No evidence of malicious behavior is present in the provided logs. However, if this occurs alongside other anomalies (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized installations, or system instability), further investigation is warranted.\n\n**Recommendation:** If the user is concerned, they can:\n- Verify the integrity of **SDXHelper.exe** via **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes**.\n- Check for recent **Office updates** or **language pack installations**.\n- Monitor system performance and logs for unusual patterns."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The paths are all within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, which seems a bit odd. Office usually doesn't generate JavaScript files in those locations. Also, there are multiple entries with the same file names being created, like the hu-hu-ui-strings-json file appearing twice. That repetition might be a red flag. \n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, but the .new extension might indicate a temporary file, which isn't necessarily bad. However, the main concern here is the SDXHelper.exe activity.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is a process associated with Microsoft Office, but typically it's used for managing add-ins or solutions. The fact that it's creating so many JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder could be part of a malicious activity, like injecting code or modifying the registry. Wait, there are also some registry events from svchost.exe. svchost.exe is a normal system process, but if it's modifying the registry, that might be part of a legitimate update or a potential exploit.\n\nBut looking at the registry events, they're all from svchost.exe, which is common for system services. However, the combination of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe and registry changes by svchost.exe might be suspicious. Also, the fact that some entries have process names as null and task as None could indicate incomplete logs or possibly errors in data collection, which might mean something is being hidden.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Maybe these are just normal operations. For example, when you install or update Office add-ins, it might create files in those directories. However, creating so many JavaScript files with UI strings in different languages might be a sign of something else. Also, the repetition of the same files could be an indicator of a malicious payload being repeatedly written, which is common in some malware behaviors.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the presence of both file creation and registry events. If an attacker is trying to persist on the system, they might modify the registry to ensure their code runs on startup. The svchost.exe events could be part of that. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the combination of these events, especially the unusual file creation patterns, makes this batch worth investigating further. \n\nSo, the answer is that this is interesting because of the unusual number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe in unexpected locations, the repetition of files, and the registry changes by svchost.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### 1. **Abnormal File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**\n   - **High Volume of JavaScript Files**: Multiple files (e.g., `*.js`, `*.json`) are created in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory, which is typically not used for user-generated files. These files appear to be language-specific UI strings (e.g., `hu-hu-ui-strings-json`, `id-id-ui-strings-json`), which may indicate **unauthorized add-in or solution deployment**.\n   - **Redundant File Creation**: Some files (e.g., `hu-hu-ui-strings-json`, `id-id-ui-strings-json`) are created **multiple times**, suggesting potential **malicious payload injection** or **redundant operations**.\n\n### 2. **Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`**\n   - **Unusual Registry Activity**: Multiple `RegistryEvent` entries from `svchost.exe` (a legitimate system process) indicate **registry value changes or object deletions**. While this could be part of a legitimate update, it raises concerns about **potential persistence mechanisms** or **malicious configuration changes**.\n\n### 3. **Inconsistent Logging**\n   - **Missing Process Information**: Two events have `process: null` and `winlog.task: None`, which may indicate **incomplete or tampered logs**, possibly masking malicious activity.\n\n### 4. **Contextual Concerns**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe Behavior**: While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Office process, its unusual file-creation patterns in non-standard locations (e.g., `SolutionPackages`) are **not typical for normal Office operations**.\n   - **Registry and File Activity Combination**: The pairing of **file creation** (by `SDXHelper.exe`) and **registry modification** (by `svchost.exe`) could indicate **malware persistence** or **exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch warrants further investigation due to the **unusual file creation patterns**, **registry modifications**, and **inconsistent logging**. These indicators may suggest **malicious activity** (e.g., add-in tampering, persistence mechanisms) or **misconfigured systems**. Analysts should:\n- Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity).\n- Check the integrity of files in the `SolutionPackages` directory.\n- Investigate the source of the registry changes and verify their legitimacy. \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting â€“ requires deeper analysis.**"}

The first event is about SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Then there are 20 entries where EXCEL.EXE is setting registry values. After that, SDXHelper.exe creates several more JS files in similar paths.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office add-in or solution packaging tool, right? So creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal during installation or updates. But why so many files? The filenames look like they're language-specific UI strings, which could be part of a legitimate package. However, the repetition of EXCEL.EXE modifying the registry multiple times seems unusual. Typically, a legitimate application wouldn't set the same registry value 20 times in a row. That might indicate something malicious trying to persist or modify settings. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is installing a new add-in, and Excel is configuring it. However, the combination of multiple file creations by SDXHelper and excessive registry changes by Excel raises a red flag.

Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's legitimate. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory of a SolutionPackage. That's part of Office's Click-to-Run installation, which sometimes downloads files. However, the presence of multiple files with similar naming patterns might indicate something. \n\nThe filenames include hashes, which could be normal for package resources.
