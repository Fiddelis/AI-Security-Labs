{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious yet. But then I see powershell.exe activities. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the powershell.exe entries has a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub raw URL. The command uses WebClient's DownloadFile method. Wait, downloading files from external sources can be a red flag, especially if it's not part of a known legitimate process. But GitHub is a common source, so maybe it's just a normal download. However, the fact that there are multiple such downloads might be worth looking into.\n\nThen there are events about image loaded, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are .NET framework components, which are legitimate. But the presence of multiple image loads could be normal, depending on the context. However, the file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory might be suspicious. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to execute something without leaving traces, or maybe just a temporary script.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, the PowerShell commands are all downloading LICENSE.txt files from various GitHub repositories. The names of the repositories are a bit generic, like \"modulo_comum\" or \"componente_base\". It's possible that these are legitimate, but the repetition and the fact that they're all using the same method (WebClient.DownloadFile) might be a pattern worth investigating. Also, the fact that the Temp files are being created and deleted could be part of a script that's trying to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of malware configuration, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, combined with the PowerShell activities and the network connections, it might indicate some form of automated script or tool being used.\n\nI should also check if there's any unusual process behavior. Chrome's DNS queries and network connections are normal, but if there's a sudden spike or unusual domains involved, that would be a problem. However, the logs don't mention specific domains beyond GitHub, which is a legitimate site.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell scripts downloading files from GitHub, creating and deleting temporary files, and loading .NET components might be part of a benign process, like automated testing or configuration. However, the repetitive nature of the downloads and the use of temporary files could also be indicative of malicious activity, such as downloading payloads or scripts. Since the logs don't show any obvious malicious indicators like suspicious domains, file hashes, or unexpected processes, but the combination of these events is somewhat unusual, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. The justification would be the repeated PowerShell downloads and temp file handling, which might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes download files from GitHub using WebClient.DownloadFile, create\/delete temporary files, and load .NET framework components. While not definitively malicious, the pattern of network activity and file operations raises suspicion of potential script-based attacks or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used for downloading files from URLs, that can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has a PowerShell command that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub raw link. The URL is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_padrao\/registro_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" and saves it to a temporary directory. Similarly, there's another entry with a different GitHub URL downloading to another temp file. \n\nWait, GitHub's raw URLs are often used for legitimate purposes, like fetching license files. But the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from different GitHub repositories might be normal. However, I should check if these are standard license files or something else. The filenames are LICENSE.txt, which are common, but maybe the content isn't benign. However, without seeing the actual content, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple File created events. For example, one file is created in the user's Downloads folder, another in the AppData directory. These could be normal, but if they're related to the downloaded files from PowerShell, maybe they're part of a larger process. \n\nThen there's the event with winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a legitimate setup. However, if it's being used in an unusual way, that could be a problem. \n\nLooking at the registry events, there are several Registry value set events for chrome.exe and others. Chrome modifying registry values isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like injecting code or changing settings, that could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThere's also a Network connection detected event for MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal, but if there's unusual network activity, that might be a concern. \n\nThe key points here are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the use of PowerShell to download files, especially multiple times, could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or download malicious payloads. However, the URLs provided are for LICENSE.txt files, which are usually benign. But attackers sometimes use similar techniques to download malicious content, so the presence of multiple such events might be worth investigating. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that there are multiple File created events, some in temporary directories and others in user folders, might indicate that the system is being used for some kind of data collection or setup. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch has some suspicious activity, but it's not conclusive. The presence of multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub could be benign, but in the context of a security investigation, it's worth looking into further. Therefore, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.6, as there are indicators that could be part of a malicious activity, but not enough to confirm it definitively.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are observed downloading files from GitHub raw URLs (e.g., 'LICENSE.txt') to temporary directories, which could indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving svchost.exe and powershell.exe. Both of these are common system processes, but they can be abused by malware. However, just seeing them isn't enough to flag as malicious. I need to look for unusual behavior.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1\". Deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" might be normal, but the name \"spawn\" could be a red flag. Sometimes attackers use names that are similar to legitimate ones but with slight variations. Also, the use of redirection to suppress output might be hiding something.\n\nAnother entry has \"reg.exe DELETE HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \/V \"pacote_auxiliar\" \/f\". Deleting a registry value in the Run key could be an attempt to remove a persistent backdoor. However, the name \"pacote_auxiliar\" seems like a Portuguese term, which might be a false flag or could be benign if the user is in a Portuguese-speaking region. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a mention of SCHTASKS being used, which is a legitimate command for managing scheduled tasks. However, the combination with other commands and the suppression of output might be suspicious. Additionally, the repeated use of powershell.exe and process access events could indicate that an attacker is trying to maintain persistence or execute commands without being detected.\n\nAnother point is the presence of multiple registry value sets. While registry changes are normal, a high volume or specific changes in certain keys (like Run or RunOnce) can be a sign of malicious activity. However, in this batch, the registry events don't specify which keys are being modified, so it's a bit unclear.\n\nThe command line for whoami.exe is straightforward, just executing the whoami command, which is normal. But the fact that it's being called multiple times might be part of a larger process, like checking user context.\n\nI also see that conhost.exe is involved in registry value sets. Conhost is a legitimate process related to console windows, but again, if it's doing unexpected registry changes, that's a concern.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious elements are the use of SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn,\" the deletion of a registry value in the Run key, and the multiple process accesses, especially with powershell.exe. These could be indicative of an attacker trying to clean up after themselves or modify system configurations. However, the evidence isn't conclusive because some of these actions could be part of normal administrative tasks. The confidence level is moderate—there are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation, but not enough to be certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including deletion of scheduled tasks (SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN 'spawn'), registry modifications in Run keys, and repeated process access events involving PowerShell and CMD.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the entries, most of them involve PowerShell.exe with various Windows log tasks. There are multiple instances of \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. Also, there are a few \"Image loaded\" events pointing to system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but then there's an image loaded from \"MpOAV.dll\" which is part of Windows Defender. That might be suspicious if it's not expected, but maybe it's just a legitimate process.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be part of a cleanup, but sometimes attackers create and delete files to avoid detection. The fact that it's in the Temp folder and then deleted might be a red flag.\n\nThere are also multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events, which might be related to PowerShell's own processes. However, the repetition of certain events, like the same command line being used multiple times, could indicate some automated or scripted activity.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"whoami.exe\" which is a legitimate tool, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. However, in this case, it's just a single instance.\n\nThe combination of PowerShell being used multiple times, creating and deleting files, and loading certain DLLs could be indicative of malicious behavior, especially if there's a pattern that's not typical for the system's normal operations.

That's a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The tasks include things like 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. The 'Image loaded' entries point to specific DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a recurring command: 'powershell.exe & {}'. That's a bit odd because the empty script block doesn't do anything. Maybe it's a placeholder or a way to obfuscate the actual command. Also, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a sign of malicious activity trying to execute a script temporarily without leaving traces.\n\nThen there are entries about registry value sets. While modifying the registry isn't inherently bad, if it's done by processes like PowerShell or cmd.exe, especially in a way that's not typical for the system's normal operations, that might be suspicious. However, some of these are from conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe, which are legitimate processes. \n\nThe presence of multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line might be normal, but combined with the other events, it could indicate something's up. Also, the fact that the same file is created and then deleted quickly might be an attempt to hide the presence of a malicious script.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be part of normal system operations, especially with PowerShell being a common administrative tool. But the combination of creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, along with multiple registry changes and the suspicious command line, raises a red flag. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the mix of PowerShell activities, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications might indicate an investigation is needed.

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, File created, Process accessed, etc.\n\nHmm, the first few lines are all chrome.exe with Registry value set. But Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, maybe some settings, but not sure if that's suspicious. Then there's a line with powershell.exe and command_line as 'powershell.exe & {}', which might be an empty command, but maybe just a test or something. \n\nWait, there's a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. That path seems like a PowerShell startup script. Maybe someone is trying to set up persistence here. Then there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. \n\nThen, whoami.exe is executed, which is normal for checking user identity, but not necessarily bad. However, the next events involve PowerShell removing files from the TEMP directory. The command_line includes 'Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip' and similar for 'tarefa_base.zip'. Maybe these are part of cleaning up after some activity. \n\nAlso, there are Image loaded events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so that's normal when running PowerShell scripts that use .NET. \n\nBut the fact that PowerShell is creating and then deleting files in the TEMP directory, along with the StartupProfileData file, might indicate some malicious activity. The StartupProfileData could be a way to have the script run automatically when PowerShell starts. Also, the multiple Registry value set events might be modifying keys to maintain persistence. \n\nHowever, I need to check if these are just normal operations. For example, if the user is a legitimate admin doing some scripting, but the combination of creating files, modifying registry, and deleting them could be suspicious. The presence of both 'objeto_principal.zip' and 'tarefa_base.zip' might be part of a larger operation, like extracting and then removing a payload. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's no direct evidence of malware, but the pattern of actions (file creation, registry changes, temporary file deletion) is indicative of something trying to hide its tracks.

Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where PowerShell is running commands to remove files from the TEMP directory. The commands are using Remove-Item with paths like $env:TEMP\\componente_comum.zip, and similar names. The task in winlog is either Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle. These entries are repeated multiple times with different filenames but the same structure. \n\nNow, the user might be cleaning up temporary files, which is normal. But the repetition of removing various .zip and .txt files could be a red flag. If an attacker is trying to delete evidence, they might remove multiple files. However, it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate script that's just cleaning up after itself.\n\nLooking further, there are entries about Chrome.exe loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably normal. Also, there's a whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool for checking user context. \n\nThere's also a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be part of a profile script, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nThe key thing here is the pattern of multiple file deletions from TEMP using PowerShell. While deleting files is normal, doing so in a way that's repetitive and across different files might indicate someone is trying to remove traces of their activity. However, without more context, like other suspicious activities or network connections, it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe presence of both legitimate processes and the file deletions makes me think this could be a false positive. But the repeated removal of multiple files might still warrant further investigation. I'm leaning towards INTERESTING but with moderate confidence because the behavior is unusual enough to check, even if not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are removing files from the TEMP directory with consistent patterns, which could indicate cleanup of malicious artifacts.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing some system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. A lot of them involve PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Let me check what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a bunch of \"Image loaded\" events pointing to files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so that might be normal. But then there's an entry about MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file too, but maybe loading it through PowerShell could be suspicious if it's not expected.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell creates and deletes temporary files. The file paths are in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts. But the fact that they're creating and then immediately deleting files might be part of a cleanup process. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing malicious code, that could be bad.\n\nThere are also some \"Pipe Created\" events. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there's a lot of them or they're being used in unexpected ways, that might be a red flag.\n\nSome of the PowerShell command lines show commands like Remove-Item with Force and ErrorAction Ignore. That's just deleting files without prompting, which could be part of a script, but again, depends on context. If this is part of a legitimate application's installation or update process, it's okay. But if it's part of something trying to remove logs or evidence, that's suspicious.\n\nThen there's a \"Registry value set\" event for PowerShell and Chrome. Changing registry values can be part of configuration changes, but again, if done in a way that's not typical, it might be an indicator of compromise.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple PowerShell activities, creating and deleting files, loading DLLs, registry changes. However, many of these are legitimate activities. For example, .NET DLLs are normal, and temporary files are common. The Windows Defender DLL is also a legitimate file.\n\nBut the combination of these events might indicate that someone is using PowerShell for tasks that are not typically done by regular users. The fact that there are multiple file creations and deletions, along with registry changes, could be a sign of an automated script or a malicious process trying to avoid detection.\n\nHowever, without more context, like the user's normal behavior, it's hard to say. But given that the events are all related to PowerShell and involve a number of system changes, even if they are legitimate, it's worth investigating further. The presence of multiple events that could be indicative of both normal and potentially malicious activities makes this batch interesting enough to warrant a closer look.\n\nSo, I think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of PowerShell activities, file operations, and registry changes could be part of a malicious process, even though some elements are normal.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe with the task \"Registry value set\". That alone might not be suspicious because Chrome and other applications can modify the registry. But the repetition could be a sign of something, maybe a lot of changes happening in a short time. However, without more context, like specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe with the task \"Process accessed\" and \"Process Create\". PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The fact that it's being used multiple times might be normal, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a red flag. However, looking at the command lines, there's nothing obvious here. The \"whoami.exe\" processes are just running the whoami command, which is a standard way to check the current user. That's normal and not suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe with a path that includes a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be part of its normal operation. But the other file created by powershell.exe is \"pacote_ativo.txt\". The name \"pacote_ativo\" might be in Portuguese, possibly meaning \"active package\" or something similar. Not sure if that's significant, but the file is created in the Downloads folder, which is common for user activities. However, if this is part of a larger attack, like downloading and executing malicious files, that could be an issue. But the log only mentions the file creation, not execution or any malicious content.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple registry changes by Chrome and PowerShell processes, some process creations, and a couple of file creations. None of the events seem to indicate a clear attack vector. The repetition of events might be normal system behavior, especially if the system is under heavy use. However, the presence of PowerShell being accessed multiple times could be a concern if it's being used for something unusual, but the logs don't show that.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level.
